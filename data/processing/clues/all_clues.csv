During this time, road travel is difficult and air travel prone to delay because of sandstorms. Northern cities have high humidity, while those along the coast are cooled by sea breezes. In the winter, the oases of the far south are pleasant and attract many visitors. The desert temperature drops dramatically at night. North of the Sahara, temperatures are very mild from September to May and vary little between day and night. South of the Sahara, temperatures are pleasant from October to April, but there are great variations between day and night. Coastal towns are prone to storms from the sea. Rainfall is relatively low throughout the country and in the far south it is virtually unknown. Cotton and linen lightweights are best for winter months and for evenings in desert areas. Woollens and light rainwear are advised for the winter along the coast and the Hauts Plateaux. Remember that desert temperatures can drop very low during the night, so don't get caught out with only flimsy layers. South of the Sahara, from mid-December to mid-January, temperatures drop and warm clothes are necessary both in the morning and the evening. A mountain sleeping bag is also required when camping. Algeria is situated along the North African coast, bordered to the east by Tunisia and Libya, to the southeast by Niger, to the southwest by Mali, and to the west by Mauritania and Morocco.

Further south lies the area of the Hauts Plateaux mountains of up to 2,000m (6,600ft) covered in cedar, pine and cypress forests with broad arable plains dividing the plateaux. The remaining 85% of the country is the Sahara Desert in its various forms, sustaining only 500,000 people, many of whom are nomadic tribes with goat and camel herds. The Sahara region contains two mountain ranges: the dramatic Hoggar massif, rising to almost 3,000m (9,800ft) and the Tassili N’Ajjer.

This is peak season for wildlife safari as animals are much easier to spot because the vegetation is less dense, and animals tend to congregate around waterholes. Temperatures are around 25°C (77°F), but they are at least 10 degrees cooler in the south. The Kalahari Desert, in the southwest, may experience cold and frosty early mornings and evenings too. The wet season is from November to April. November can be very hot and humid, while January and February are the wettest months. Some safari lodges and camps are closed during this period too. If you are visiting the Okavango Delta and Chobe National Park, the months from June to September are the best time.

Situated on the west coast of Africa, Cameroon is bordered to the west by the Gulf of Guinea, to the northwest by Nigeria, to the northeast by Chad (with Lake Chad at its northern tip), to the east by the Central African Republic and to the south by Congo-Brazzaville (Republic of the Congo), Gabon and Equatorial Guinea. The far north of the country is a semi-desert broadening into the vast Maroua Plain, with game reserves and mineral deposits. This is bordered to the west by the lush Mandara Mountains; the Benue River rises here and flows westwards into the Niger. The country to the northwest is particularly striking: volcanic peaks covered by bamboo forest rise to over 2,000m (6,500ft), with waterfalls and villages scattered over the lower slopes. Further to the south and west are savannah uplands, while dense forest covers the east and south. The highest peak, at 4,095m (13,434ft) is Mount Cameroon, which lies close to the coast. The humid coastal strip is tropical, with a mixture of rainforest and farmland.

Cape Verde is situated in the Atlantic Ocean, 620km (385 miles) off the West Coast of Africa and comprises 10 islands, 9 inhabited and one uninhabited, and five islets in two groups: Barlavento (Windwards) and Sotavento (Leewards). In the former group are the islands of São Vicente, Santo Antão, São Nicolau, Santa Luzia, Sal and Boa Vista, along with the smaller islands of Branco and Raso; the Sotavento group comprises the islands of Santiago, Maio, Fogo and Brava, along with the smaller islands of Rei and Rombo. Land varies from island to island, but most have mountain peaks; the highest being Pico do Fogo, an active volcano on Fogo. The islands in the east are generally known for flat beaches and desert land. Western islands are rockier, with steep cliffs. Much of the land in Cape Verde is infertile and lacks minerals, which forces the country to import the majority of its food and goods. Wind and water erosion also make agriculture less sustainable, though much of the workforce lies in it.",['CV'],1,['CPV']
3825,"Hot all year with a defined dry season. Especially hot in the north, with greater humidity in the south. The rainy season is mainly from May to October, while the driest months are January and February. Heavy rainfall is typical in the southwestern forest areas. Light, linen and tropical, waterproof clothing. The Central African Republic is bordered to the north by Chad, to the east by Sudan, to the south by the Democratic Republic of Congo and the Republic of Congo, and to the west by Cameroon. It is a large, landlocked territory of mostly uninhabited forest, bush and game reserves. The Chari River cuts through the centre from east to north; towards the Cameroon border the landscape rises to 2,000m (6,560ft) west of Bocaranga in the northwest corner, while the southwest has dense tropical rainforest. Most of the country is rolling or flat plateau covered with dry deciduous forest, except where it has been reduced to grass savannah or destroyed by bush fire. The northeast becomes desert scrubland and mountainous in parts.",['CF'],1,['CAF']
3826,"Chad has a hot and tropical climate, though temperatures do vary depending on area. The southern rainy season runs May-October, and the central rains from June-September. The north has very little rain all year. The dry season is often windy, and cooler during the evenings. Airy linens, and good waterproof clothing. Chad is situated in central Africa, bordered by Libya to the north, Niger, Nigeria and Cameroon to the west, the Central African Republic to the south, and Sudan to the east. The topography ranges from equatorial forests to the driest of deserts. In the northeast lies Ennedi, and to the north the volcanic Tibesti range - largely sheer cliffs, ravines and canyons set among Saharan sand dunes.",['TD'],1,['TCD']
3827,"The climate is tropical and very warm. Coastal areas are hot and very humid, interspaced with rains and seasonal cyclones (January to April). The upland areas are cooler, particularly at night, and have higher rainfall. The rainy season is from November to April. Lightweight cottons and linens with waterproofing during the rainyseason. Warmer garments and rainwear are needed for the mountains. The Comoro archipelago is situated in the Indian Ocean, north of Madagascar. It consists of four main islands of volcanic origin, which are surrounded by coral reefs: Ngazidja (formerly Grande Comore), Nzwani (formerly Anjouan), Mwali (formerly Mohéli) and Mahoré (Mayotte). The latter is administered by France, but is claimed by the Federal Islamic Republic of the Comoros. Land can only support subsistence agriculture, but the surrounding seas are rich in marine life.",['KM'],1,['COM']
3828,"Varies according to distance from the equator, which lies across the north of the country. The dry season in the north is from December to February, and in the south, April to October. The temperature is warm year round and humidity is high. Lightweight clothes are recommended all year, with rainwear during the rainy season. The Democratic Republic of Congo is the third-largest country in Africa and is bordered to the north by the Central African Republic and Sudan, to the east by Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi and Tanzania, to the south by Zambia and Angola, and to the west by the Republic of Congo and the Angolan enclave, Cabinda. The country has a coastline of only 27km (17 miles), at the outlet of the Congo River, which flows into the Atlantic. The country straddles the equator and has widely differing geographical features, including mountain ranges in the north and west, a vast central plain through which the Congo River flows, and the volcanoes and lakes of the Kivu region. The river has given rise to extensive tropical rainforests on the western border with the Republic of Congo.",['CG'],1,['COG']

Between October and April it is slightly cooler with occasional light rain; however, there is generally less than 150mm (6in) of rainfall annually. Djibouti is part of the African continent, bordered to the northeast and east by the Red Sea, the southeast by Somalia, the southwest by Ethiopia and to the north by Eritrea. The country is a barren strip of land around the Gulf of Tadjoura, varying in width from 20km (12 miles) to 90km (56 miles), with a coastline of 300km (188 miles), much of it white sandy beaches. Inland is semi-desert and desert, with thorn bushes, steppes and volcanic mountain ranges.",['DJ'],1,['DJI']
3830,"Egypt is a huge country with plenty of variety in its climate; when it’s chilly and wet in Alexandria, it can be ravishingly hot in Aswan. The best time to visit most sights, including the pyramids and the Valley of the Kings, or diving in the Red Sea, is from February to April and October to November. During these months the heat reminds you that it's the ‘Land of the Sun', but not too hot to be enjoyable. At this time, the skies and sea are a perfect blue. The downside is that these are the most popular times of the year for visitors. In April, the hot, dusty khamsin wind blows from the Sahara, making touring of sights potentially troublesome; during an intense sand storm, vision may be reduced to a few metres. During the hot, dry summers (June-August) there’s always the risk of dehydration and heat exhaustion, which might confine visitors indoors during the early afternoon. Winters (November-February) are usually mild and often overcast, leaving the desert and its ancient monuments looking lacklustre. Rainfall is negligible except on the coast. Loose, lightweight, modest cottons and linens, with warmer clothes for winter and cooler evenings, are culturally and climatically suitable. Traditional home of the roaming Bedouin, most of Egypt's landmass is comprised of flat, mostly featureless desert, supportive of minimal vegetation. The Mediterranean Sea forms Egypt's northern border, bringing cooler weather to the seaboard city of Alexandria and providing a coastal getaway for Cairo's residents. To the east, lies the mountainous Sinai Peninsula, which borders Israel and the Palestinian Territories; to the south, the deserts of Egypt quietly roll into the deserts of Sudan; to the west, the Great Western Desert forms an almost seamless wilderness through Libya and beyond. Sinai is divided from the main landmass of Africa by the country's busy shipping lane, the Suez Canal. For centuries, however, it was the River Nile, plied by felucca (traditional Nile sailing boats), that provided the main conduit for trade along the country's length. Railways and roads now compete for that distinction, but the Nile remains an important economic and cultural artery. The Nile perfuses the Delta north of Cairo, supporting 90% of the population in a flood land of cotton and rice-growing crops. The river's potency has been reduced since the building of the Aswan Dam; on the positive side, the dam has provided the country with a safe and reliable electricity supply - and has had the side effect of keeping the crocodiles out.",['EG'],1,['EGY']
3831,"Tropical climate all year round. Rainfall is heavy for most of the year, decreasing slightly in most areas between December and February. Lightweight cottons and linens. Waterproofing is necessary. Equatorial Guinea is bordered to the south and east by Gabon, to the north by Cameroon and to the west by the Gulf of Guinea. The country also comprises the island of Bioko, formerly Fernando Po, 34km (21 miles) off the coast of Cameroon, and the small offshore islands of Corisco, Great Elobey, Small Elobey and Annobón (formerly Pagalu). The mainland province, Rió Muni, is mainly forest, with plantations on the coastal plain and some mountains. Bioko rises steeply to two main peaks in the north and south. The southern area is rugged and inaccessible. Cultivation and settlements exist on the other slopes; above the farming land, the forest is thick. The beaches around the islands are extremely beautiful.",['GQ'],1,['GNQ']
3832,"There is no time of year that is particularly unsuitable for visiting Eritrea. The country can be divided into three major zones: the central highlands, the coastal region, and the western lowlands. Each has a different climatic pattern. In the highlands, the hottest month is usually May with highs around 30°C (86°F). Winter is between December and February with lows at night that can be near freezing and dramatic temperature differences between day and night. Asmara itself enjoys a pleasant climate all year round. There are two rainy seasons: the short rains in March and April and the main rains from late June to the beginning of September. These are unlikely to impede travel or general enjoyment of the highlands. On the coast, the months from June to September are extremely hot with daily temperatures ranging from 40°C (100°F) to 50°C (122°F) (and hotter in Dankalia). In winter the daily temperature ranges from 21°C (70°F) to 35°C (95°F). This is a good time to visit, when it is not insufferably hot and skies are invariably clear. It is always warm enough to swim, even in the winter months of February to April, which can be cloudy. The rainy season on the coast north of Dankalia falls in the winter months; in Dankalia itself, rain is extremely rare. In the western lowlands, the high temperatures are comparable to those on the coast in the hottest months of April until June. December is the coldest month with temperatures falling as low as 15°C (59°F). The rainy seasons are the same as for the highlands. If you are in the highlands during winter it is advisable to bring at least one set of warm clothes. Otherwise shirts and a couple of pairs of trousers are enough: lightweight cotton for walking, and for wearing in the evening. Despite their limited resources Eritreans are always smartly dressed and even during sandstorms in the lowlands they seem to be able to remain pristine. Eritrea has a large Muslim population and women should dress with this in mind, not exposing the knees or shoulders. This will avoid a lot of trouble, especially in the lowland areas. Shorts are not generally worn, by men or women, in Asmara or other towns, with the exception of the coast, but obviously if you are travelling in Dankalia or other out of the way areas they are practical. As a general rule, Eritreans dress modestly and you should do the same. A sunhat is essential on the coast and in the western lowlands, as too are a good pair of sunglasses. Good walking shoes or boots are essential if you are travelling anywhere other than the major cities. Trainers, flip flops or sandals are all useful, depending on the purpose of your stay. Eritrea is a land of extraordinary physical diversity. It is one of the few countries where visitors can truly experience ‘four seasons in a day’. The eastern lowlands that stretch along the Red Sea for almost 1,000km (625 miles ) offer a stunning variety of scenes, from barren deserts to towering volcanic landscapes. Scattered off the coast and its myriad coral reefs are the 350 islands of the Dahlak Archipelago. In the north is the border with North Sudan and in the south, Djibouti. The centre of the country comprises the precipitous highland plateau that appears to float in the clouds as you wind up the vertiginous slopes of the escarpment from the coast by road or even steam railway. At nearly 2,500m (8,200ft) altitude, Asmara is the highest capital in Africa. Much of the southern highlands is agricultural and borders Ethiopia. To the west of Eritrea, the plateau fractures and tumbles into the western lowlands where a desert landscape stretches out across vast plains and meets the border with the north of Sudan.",['ER'],1,['ERI']
3833,"Due to variations in altitude, the weather can be changeable. In the Highveld region, temperatures are relatively mild, ranging from between 5°C (41°F) and 21°C (70°F) in the winter, and between 13°C (55°F) and 25°C (77°F) in the summer. The Lowveld has a warmer, drier climate, with average temperatures ranging from 8°C (46°F) to 27°C (81°F) in the winter, and from 18°C (64°F) to 32°C (90°F) in the summer.  Choosing when to visit Eswatini (Swaziland) is a matter of personal preference. The wet summer season, between October and March, can be unbearable in the Lowveld but pleasant in the Highveld. Hikers should aim for an early start during the summer, as the midday heat can get intense and afternoon electrical storms are also quite common. Heavy rains can also have a negative impact on activities such as white-water rafting and caving. The dry winter season, between June and August, is usually mild in the Lowveld but can get quite cold in the Highveld. In the dry season, there is a lack of lush vegetation which makes it easier to see the wildlife. However, since the wildlife reserves throughout the country are so small, it’s always fairly easy to see game all year round. Visit during the rainy season, though, if you want to witness the variety of birds Eswatini (Swaziland) has to offer. Bring light clothing, such as linens, and a jacket for the evenings. Waterproofs are rarely needed unless you're doing a lot of walking between October and March. Since hiking is the best way to see the beautiful landscape, hiking boots or sturdy trainers are a must. Eswatini (Swaziland) is surrounded to the north, west and south by the Mpumalanga province of South Africa and to the east by Mozambique. There are four main topographical regions: the Highveld Inkangala – a wide ribbon of partly reforested, rugged country including the Usutu pine forest; the Peak Timbers in the northwest; the Middleveld, which rolls down from the Highveld through hills and fertile valleys; and the Lowveld, or bush country, with hills rising from 170 to 360m (560 to 1,180ft). The Lubombo plateau is an escarpment along the eastern fringe of the Lowveld, comprising of mainly cattle country and mixed farmland. Eswatini’s (Swaziland's) four major rivers are the Komati, Usutu, Mbuluzi and Ngwavuma.",['SZ'],1,['SWZ']
3834,"Ethiopia is an ecologically diverse country; you can therefore expect several climate zones ranging from tropical savanna in the west to warm desert climate in the east. Most of the country is highland with many of its tourist destinations like Lalibela and Gondar are at an elevation above 2,000m (6,561ft). These places enjoy a considerably cooler climate year-round. Generally, the best time to visit Ethiopia is between November and February when clear, sunny days bring regular average temperatures of 25°C (77°F). This period is considered the dry season as rainfall is at its lowest. This is also a prime time for bird watching. If you're heading to the countryside, the period between September to October is an excellent time to visit as the landscapes are lushly pretty after all the rain. The best time to visit Addis Ababa, Aksum, Lalibela and Gondar The best time to visit Addis Ababa, Aksum, Lalibela and Gondar is from November to April. The rainy season (July and August) brings soaring temperatures and humid conditions to most places in Ethiopia, including Addis Ababa, Aksum, Lalibela and Gondar. July is the wettest month for Gondar and Aksum, while August is the wettest month for Addis Ababa and Lalibela. March, April, May, June, September and October are considered the shoulder months. It's typically cheaper to travel during these months, but you may get a short burst of rain every now and then. Visitors may also want to coincide your travel with colourful festivals. September 11 is Ethiopian New Year while September 27 is Meskel, which marks the discovery of the True Cross by the Roman Empress Helena. The biggest celebration takes place in Addis Ababa's Meskel Square. Other big days include Gena or Ledet celebrated on January 7, this is considered the Ethiopian Christmas when families gather to enjoy doro wat (chicken stew) with injera. Timkat, the Ethiopian Orthodox equivalent to Epiphany, is celebrated on January 19. The best place to see this festival is Gondar where the Fasil's Pool is filled with water for a re-enactment of the first baptism. The best time to visit the Lower Omo Valley The best time to visit the Lower Omo Valley is from January to April. The weather is dry but hot (particularly in areas around Turmi) and there are many traditional ceremonies taking place. The best time to visit the Danakil Depression Situated in northern Ethiopia near the border with Eritrea, the Danakil Depression sits at the juncture of three tectonic plates and is one of the hottest places on earth with temperatures regularly top 41°C (106°F). There really is no best time to visit this otherworldly place, although some tours may claim that temperatures are more tolerable from October to February. Due to vast altitude differences between highland and lowland areas, if you plan to explore Ethiopia fully you should prepare for a wide range of temperature differences. Bringing clothes that can be easily layered is the obvious choice. You will also need lightweight clothing for the lowlands and medium-weight for the hill country. At least one warm sweater or pullover should be brought along to cope with dramatic temperature drops once the sun goes down. Please note that many churches and monasteries (particular in Lalibela) require women to wear a headscarf and cover their arms and legs. Ethiopia is situated in northeast Africa, in the area known as 'The Horn of Africa'. It is bordered by Eritrea, Sudan, South Sudan, Kenya, Somalia, the self-proclaimed separatist territory of Somaliland, and Djibouti. Encompassing an area of 1,104,300 sq km (426,372 sq miles), it is roughly twice the size of France and is completely landlocked. The central area is a vast highland region of volcanic rock forming a watered, temperate zone surrounded by hot, arid, inhospitable desert. The Great Rift Valley (which starts in Palestine, runs down the Red Sea and diagonally southwest through Ethiopia, Kenya and Malawi) slices through the central mountain ranges. The escarpments on either side of the country are steepest in the north where the terrain is very rugged. Within the country there is a huge diversity in altitude. The highest point is at Ras Dashen in the Simien Mountains, which at 4,550m (14,930 ft) is Africa's 10th tallest mountain. The lowest point is inside the Danakil Depression which reaches 125m (410ft) below sea level. To the south, the landscape is generally flatter and much of the east and southeast is taken over by semi-arid scrubland. Although mass- deforestation has been a problem since the Middle Ages, the lowlands are still noted for their verdant evergreen forests. Ethiopia is home to four major river systems, the most important being the Blue Nile which begins at Lake Tana.",['ET'],1,['ETH']
3835,"Equatorial with up to 80% humidity. The dry season is from June to August, and the main rainy season is from October to May. Average temperatures are 25°C (77°F).

Gabon is bordered to the west by the Atlantic Ocean, to the north by Equatorial Guinea and Cameroon, and to the east and south by the Congo. The 800km-long (500 miles) sandy coastal strip is a series of palm-fringed bays, lagoons and estuaries. The lush tropical vegetation (which covers about 82% of the interior) gives way in parts to the savannah. There are many rivers and they remain the main communication routes along which settlements have grown. Of the 40 or so Bantu tribes, the largest are the Fang, Eshira, Mbele and Okande. Only a small percentage of native Gabonese live in the towns, as the population is concentrated in the coastal areas and the villages along the banks of the many rivers, following a more traditional rural style of life.",['GA'],1,['GAB']
3836,"The Gambia lies in a region that arguably has the most agreeable climate in West Africa; the weather is subtropical, with distinct dry and rainy seasons. Temperatures highs tend to average 29°C (84°F) – 34°C (93°F). From mid-November to early June, coastal areas are usually dry, while the rainy season lasts from mid to late June to October. Inland, the cool season is shorter, and daytime temperatures are very high between March and June. Sunny periods occur on most days, even during the rainy season, when showers can be short and spectacular. Most charter flights run from November to May, coinciding with the time of year when the temperature is pleasant and humidity is low. November is The Gambia’s least rainy month, offering a less humid and sunny holiday. Christmas and Easter are the two busiest travel periods, while the shoulder seasons represent the best times to arrive if you wish to escape the crowds. June to August, although rainy, offer a great alternative and lush green vegetation. Bird watchers will revel in this period, as colourful species in their breeding plumage emerge. Lightweight or tropical for most of the year, with rainwear for the rainy season. The Gambia, situated on West Africa's Atlantic coast, is a thin ribbon of land, at no point wider than 50km (30 miles), running east-west on both banks of the River Gambia. In the east, where the river dwindles, the country is barely 15km (9 miles) wide. The smallest and westernmost mainland African nation, The Gambia is essentially an enclave of Senegal with whom it shares 740km (460 miles) of land border. To the west though, The Gambia is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean and has 80km (50 miles) of coastline. The country is predominantly a low plateau, which decreases in height as it nears the Atlantic coast. The plateau is bisected by the river and is broken in a few places by low flat-topped hills and by the river's tributaries. The landscape is essentially flat, with the highest point just 53m (174ft) above sea level. In the west of the country, near the coast, the riverbanks are backed mainly by mangrove swamps, while in the inland area, which extends from central Gambia to the eastern border, the river is lined by steep, red ironstone banks covered with tropical forest. Away from the river, find wooded, park-like savannah, with large areas carpeted by a variety of trees such as baobab, silk-cotton, mahogany and oil palm. On the coast, the river meets the Atlantic with impressive sand cliffs and 50km (31 miles) of beaches, the best of which are broad, palm-fringed and strewn with shells.",['GM'],1,['GMB']
3837,"Ghana has a typically tropical climate thanks to its proximity to the equator and low elevations – the entire country lies below 1,000m (3300ft). Daytime temperatures are high throughout the year, approaching or surpassing 30°C (86°F) on most days, and humidity is also very high, especially along the coast. Temperatures tend to drop to around 20°C (68°F) drop at night, more noticeably in the relatively dry north than the humid south. The most temperate part of Ghana is the highlands area flanking the Volta Basin, which is often pleasantly cool after dusk. There are two rainy seasons: from March to July and from September to October Rainfall is highest in the south, with some areas receiving in excess of 2,000mm each year, but the drier north more typically receives about 800mm annually. The capital Accra, together with the coast running east to Togo and Benin, lies within the Dahomey Gap, a tract of savannah that receives relatively little rain and divides the Upper Guinean forests (running westward from central Ghana) from the Lower Guinean forests (running southward from Nigeria southward to the Congo). A noteworthy climatic phenomenon is the harmattan winds, which blow in from the northeast from December to March, bringing dust from the Sahara and reducing visibility to as little as 1km (0.6 miles). Ghana is fine to visit at all times of year, but if you have the choice, aim for the northern hemisphere winter i.e. October through to April, when humidity is lowest and the weather is typically quite dry. There are also fewer mosquitoes (and a decreased risk of contracting malaria), dirt roads are in better condition, and there is less likelihood of you or your luggage being drenched in an unexpected storm. However, photographers might want to avoid the dull ambient light and grey skies associated with the harmattan in December. Light and loose is the way to go in this humid tropical climate. Bring light trousers or skirts made of a natural fabric such as cotton, combined with a stash of cotton T-shirts, and plenty of socks and underwear, also ideally must be made from natural fabrics to prevent fungal infections. Ghanaians are relatively relaxed about dress codes, but women should keep their shoulders covered and wear a skirt below the knees in the predominantly Muslim north. One sweater or sweatshirt should be adequate, since night time temperatures are seldom chilly. As for footwear, a good pair of walking shoes with solid ankle support is a must, but you'll also want sandals or thongs. If you forget anything, don't stress: there is a massive used-clothing industry in Ghana, and having new clothes made from local fabrics is quick and affordable. Ghana is situated in West Africa between latitudes of 4°N and 12°N, and longitudes of 4°W and 2°E. It is a rectangular-shaped country bordered to the north by Burkina Faso, the east by Togo, the south by the Atlantic Ocean and the west by Côte d'Ivoire. It is bisected by the Prime Meridian (0°longitude), which runs through the port city of Tema, 25km (16 miles) east of the capital Accra, and Cape Three Points, the most southerly peninsula in Ghana, is also the closest land fall to the oceanic intersection of the Prime Meridian and the Equator. Ghana's coastline is dotted with sandy palm-fringed beaches and lagoons. A narrow grassy plain stretches inland from this, widening in the east, while the south and west are covered by dense rainforest. To the north are forested hills, beyond which is dry savannah and open woodland. In the far north is a plateau averaging 500m (1,600ft) in height. In the east, the Akuapim Togo hills run inland from the coast along the Togo border. The country falls almost entirely within the Volta Basin, with the Red, Black and White Volta rivers all flowing into its northern borders from Burkina Faso. Following the 1960s construction of Akosombo Dam, about 60km (37 miles) inland of the Volta Mouth, much of the river is now submerged by Lake Volta, the world’s most expansive artificial water body.",['GH'],1,['GHA']

3841,"Kenya has three types of climate: temperate subtropical climate in the west and southwest highlands (where Nairobi is located), hot and humid along the coast, and hot and dry in the north and east. Nairobi is the capital and the largest city in Kenya and experiences a subtropical highland climate. Sitting at 1,795 metres (5,889 ft) above sea level, Nairobi's evenings are cooler. The best time to visit Nairobi is from June to August when the average high is around 23°C (73°F) and rainfall is at its lowest (although the sky is often cloudy). The period between January to February is also a good time to visit Nairobi as it is sunny and warm, with an average high of 27°C (81°F). The short rainy season from late October to December and from March to May should be avoided. Mombasa is a coastal city and the second-largest city after Nairobi, situated along the Indian Ocean. This city has a tropical wet and dry climate. Avoid April and May as these are the wettest months and the area can be affected by flooding. The best time to visit Mombasa is either July to September as sunshine is abundant, as well as from October to March for aquatic activities. Malindi, a town on Malindi Bay at the mouth of the Galana River, is also situated alongside the Indian Ocean coast and is 120km (75 miles) northeast of Mombasa. Malindi has a tropical dry savannah climate. The cooler season from June to September sees the average high at 27/28°C (81/82°F), while the average high can reach 31°C (88°F) during the hotter season from November to March. With regards to rainfall, it is not particularly abundant, as it only amounts to about 1,000 millimetres (40 inches) per year, however, there are two rainy seasons: from April to June and October to November. Masai Mara is an expansive game reserve renowned for its wealth of wildlife and the Great Migration of wildebeest to and from the Serengeti every year. This area is located just south of the equator at an altitude of between 1,500 and 1,900 metres (5,000 and 6,200 ft). The climate is pleasantly warm all year round, averaging 23°C (73°F), although it is widely classified into two seasons - dry and wet. The dry season (late June to October) is best for safari as wildlife is easier to spot given that the bush is less dense and animals gather around waterholes and rivers. During this period, the days are clear with sunny skies, with fewer mosquitos, and the average high is around 25°C (77°F). The wet season is from November to May with April being the wettest month, does result in beautiful scenery, cheaper rates and newborn animal sightings. For Nairobi and the coast: lightweight cottons and linens are advised. Warmer clothing is needed in June and July, while rainwear is advisable between March and June, and October and December. For safari: loose-fitting and light neutral tones are recommended. If you are visiting a luxury lodge, pack a nice set of clothes for dinner is recommended. Kenya covers 580,367 sq km (224,081 sq miles) and sits astride the equator. It shares borders with Ethiopia in the north, Sudan in the northwest, Uganda in the west, Tanzania in the south and Somalia in the northeast. To the east lies the 480 km (300 miles) Indian Ocean coastline. The country is divided into four regions: the arid deserts of the north; the savannah lands of the south; the fertile lowlands along the coast; and highlands in the west, where the capital Nairobi is situated. Northwest of Nairobi runs the Rift Valley, dotted with lakes and containing the town of Nakuru, while further west the Aberdare National Park is overlooked by Kenya’s highest peak, and Africa’s second tallest mountain after Mount Kilimanjaro, Mount Kenya (5,199m/17,057ft), which also is a national park. In the far northwest is Lake Turkana (formerly Lake Rudolph), and in the southwest is Kenya's share of Lake Victoria.",['KE'],1,['KEN']
3842,"Temperate climate with well-marked seasons. Summer is the rainy season; 85% of rainfall occurs from October to April, especially in the mountains. Snow occurs in the highlands from May to September. The hottest period is from January to February. Lesotho is a land of clear blue skies and more than 300 days of sunshine a year. During the summer, lightweight cottons with warmer wear for the evenings is needed. In winter, medium- to heavyweight clothes are advised. Waterproofing is necessary during the rainy season. Lesotho is a landlocked country surrounded on all sides by South Africa. It is a mountainous kingdom situated at the highest part of the Drakensberg escarpment on the eastern rim of the South African plateau. Its mountainous terrain is cut by countless valleys and ravines, making it a country of great beauty. To the west, the land descends through a foothill zone of rolling hills to a lowland belt along the border where two-thirds of the population live. Three large rivers, the Caledon, the Orange and the Tugela, rise in the mountains.",['LS'],1,['LSO']
3843,"Hot, tropical climate with little variation in temperature. The wet season runs from May to October. The dry harmattan wind blows from December to March, making the coastal belt particularly arid. Lightweight cottons and linens are worn throughout the year, with waterproofing advised during the wet season. Liberia borders Sierra Leone, Guinea Republic and Côte d'Ivoire. The Atlantic coastline to the west is 560km (348 miles) long, of which over half is sandy beach. Lying parallel to the shore are three distinct belts. The low coastal belt is well watered by shallow lagoons, tidal creeks and mangrove swamps, behind which rises a gently undulating plateau, 500 to 800m (1,640 to 2,625ft) high, partly covered with dense forests. Inland and to the north is the mountain region which includes Mount Nimba at 1,752m (5,748ft) and Waulo Mountain at 1,400m (4,593ft). About half of the country's population are rural dwellers.",['LR'],1,['LBR']
3844,"Summers are very hot and dry; winters are mild with cooler evenings. The desert has hot days and cold nights. Spring and autumn are ideal times to visit, when the warm air comes up from the Sahara and meets a cooling breeze from the Mediterranean. Libya is a huge country and weather patterns vary by region. The Mediterranean coastline is the focus of most travellers' trips to Libya. There, summers are hot and dry and winters are mild, although the evenings can be worthy of scarves and hats.You'll find similar, though slightly warmer conditions to those on the other side of the ocean, such as southern Italy and Greece. Libya's coastline can be very windy, so be sure to pack a headscarf (women should of course bring one anyway as this is a deeply conservative Muslim country) to protect your ears from being blasted by the breeze. Rainfall is sporadic and rarely heavy, but drizzly days in autumn and winter are fairly common. Temperatures in Tripoli in January range from 7 to 17°C; in July, you can expect bright sunshine, blue skies and a mercury reading of between 20 and 25°C. In the winter of 2011/12, Libya's coastline had its first snowfall in decades. The desert has hot days and cold nights; the closer to the equator you travel, the hotter the days will be. With the exception of the far southern desert close to Libya's borders with Chad, southern Egypt and Sudan, humidity is generally low. Loose, long clothes in natural fabrics are recommended. A cover-up for the cooler months is advisable. Warm clothing for nights in the desert. Modest dress is advised, especially for women - upper legs and arms, shoulders and cleavage should be covered. A headscarf can be useful as extra coverage, and is essential for visiting mosques, cemeteries or other sites that bear religious significance. About 95% of Libya, Africa's fourth largest country, consists of desert (the Sahara). In the west the Sahara desert extends into Tunisia and Algeria, in the east into Egypt, and across the southern frontiers into Niger, Chad and Sudan. Only 20% of the desert features sand dunes - most of it consists of hamada (rock plateau) and, in the south, dramatic basalt mountains, the highest point of which is Bikubiti (2285m), near the Chad border. There are a few oases scattered throughout the country, mainly in the south. There are almost 1,770 km (1,100 miles) of Mediterranean coast, with a low plain extending from the Tunisian border to the Jebel Akhdar (Green Mountain) area in the east. Inland the terrain becomes more hilly. Agriculture has developed mainly on the coast between Zuwarah and Misratah in the west and from Marsa Susa to Benghazi in the east. In the uplands of the old province of Cyrenaica and on Jebel Akhdar the vegetation is more lush. Desertification is a huge problem, but the Great Manmade River Project, the largest water development scheme in the world, was built to bring water from large aquifers under the Sahara to the coastal cities. Gaddafi left the Great Manmade River Project unfinished, but there are plans to bring in new developers sometime in the future.",['LY'],1,['LBY']
3845,"Madagascar’s highly diverse subtropical climate means it pays to do some research before you plan a trip. Rainy season runs from December to March. This is when the rainforested eastern and northern parts of the country are battered by tropical storms brought on by cyclone season, and temperatures tend to hover around 30ºC (86ºF). Despite being rainy season up north, during this period, the central parts will be a lot drier and cooler, with temperatures around 25ºC (77ºF). The southern and western coasts are the driest parts of the country. Dry season runs from April to October but tourist numbers don't start to swell until early May. Peak months are July and August, due to the timing of school holidays in Europe and the USA. If visiting for wildlife, September to December is also a good time to visit, as many of the snakes and lizards populating the island come out of hibernation during this time. The mountains, including Antananarivo, are dry, cool and windy during this time of year, shifting to warm and thundery from November to April. Due to the extreme storms and occasional cyclones, travelling to Madagascar between January and March is ill-advised. To cope with the Madagascan climate, lightweights should be worn during the summer on high central plateaux and throughout the year in the north and south. Cotton and natural fibres work better in this sweaty weather. Warmer clothes are advised for during the evenings and winter in mountainous areas. Rainwear is advisable as a precaution. Located 500km (300 miles) off the coast of Mozambique in the Indian Ocean, Madagascar is world’s fourth-largest island. Accompanied by several much smaller sibling isles, it is characterised by a central chain of high mountains, the Hauts Plateaux. This spiny ridge dominates the main island’s terrain and is a dividing line that marks Madagascar’s east-and-west differences in ethnicity, climate, and scenery. On the east coast, a skinny strip of lowlands, settled from the sixth century by Polynesian seafarers, is largely covered by dense rainforests. The broader west-coast landscape, once clad in dry deciduous forests, is now mostly grasslands. On both coasts, the climate is wetter towards the north although the east coast receives the monsoon. Semi-desert and forests of cactus-like scrub characterises the island’s southern tip with much of Madagascar’s flora and fauna is wholly unique. Busy capital city, Antananarivo, is situated high up in the Hauts Plateaux and almost denotes the island’s geographical centre.",['MG'],1,['MDG']
3846,"Varies from cool in the highlands to warm around Lake Malawi. Winter (May to July) is dry and nights can be chilly, particularly in the highlands. The rainy season runs from November to March. Around Lake Malawi, in winter, the climate is particularly dry with pleasant cooling breezes. Lightweights are worn all year in the Lake Malawi area, with warmerclothes advised in the mountains, particularly during winter and onchilly evenings elsewhere. Visitors to Nyika and Zomba should note thatthe nights can be cold. Dark or 'natural' coloured clothing should beworn for game viewing. Malawi shares borders to the north and northeast with Tanzania, to the south, east and southwest with Mozambique and to the west with Zambia. Lake Malawi, the third largest lake in Africa, is the dominant feature of the country, forming the eastern boundary with Tanzania and Mozambique. The scenery varies in the country's three regions. The Northern Region is mountainous, with the highest peaks reaching over 2,500m (8,200ft), and features the rolling Nyika Plateau, rugged escarpments, valleys and the thickly forested slopes of the Viphya Plateau. The Central Region is mainly a plateau, over 1,000m (3,300ft) high, with fine upland scenery. This is the country's main agricultural area. The Southern Region is mostly low-lying except for the 2,100m-high (6,890ft) Zomba Plateau south of Lake Malawi and the huge, isolated Mulanje Massif (3,000m/10,000ft) in the southeast. The variety of landscape and the wildlife it supports make this relatively unspoilt country particularly attractive to visitors.",['MW'],1,['MWI']
3847,"Three main seasons which vary according to latitude. Rainy season runs between June and October, diminishing further north. The cooler season (October to February) is followed by extremely hot, dry weather until June. Lightweight cottons and linens are worn throughout most of the year,though warmer clothing is needed between November and February.Waterproofing is advised during the rainy season. Mali is a landlocked republic, sharing borders with Mauritania, Algeria, Burkina Faso, Côte d'Ivoire, Guinea, Niger and Senegal. It is a vast land of flat plains fed by two major rivers, the Senegal on its western edge and the great River Niger. On its journey north the Niger converges with the River Bani, and forms a rich inland delta, the marshlands of the Macina, stretching for some 450km (280 miles) along the river's length, in some places 200km (124 miles) wide. The central part of the country is arid grazing land, called the Sahel, which has suffered great drought. At Timbuktu, the Niger reaches the desert and here it turns first to the east, then to the southeast at Bourem, where it heads for the ocean. In the desert, near the Algerian and Niger borders in the northeast, the Adrar des Iforas massif rises 800m (2,625ft). The north of the country is true desert except for the few oases along the ancient trans-Saharan camel routes. Tuaregs still live around these oases and camel routes. Further south live the Peulh cattle-raising nomads. The majority of the population lives in the savannah region in the south. The peoples of this region comprise Songhai, Malinke, Senoufou, Dogon and the Bambara (the largest ethnic group).",['ML'],1,['MLI']
3848,"Most of the country is hot and dry with practically no rain. In the south, however, rainfall is higher with a rainy season which runs from July to September. The coast is tempered by trade winds and is mild with the exception of the hot Nouakchott region (where the rainy season begins a month later). Deserts are cooler and windy in March and April. Lightweight cottons and linens, with a warm wrap for cool evenings. Waterproofs are necessary for the rainy season. Mauritania is bordered by Algeria, Mali, Western Sahara (Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic) and Senegal. To the west lies the Atlantic Ocean. Mauritania consists mainly of the vast Saharan plain of sand and scrub. Most of this area is a sea of sand dunes, but in places the land rises to rocky plateaux with deep ravines leaving isolated peaks. The Adrar plateau in the central region rises to 500m (1,640ft), and the Tagant further south to 600m (1,970ft). The area is scattered with towns, small villages and oases. The northern bank of the Senegal River, which forms the country's southern border, is the only area in the country with any degree of permanent vegetation and it supports a wide variety of wildlife.",['MR'],1,['MRT']
3849,"Mauritius has a tropical maritime climate, with relatively little seasonal variation in temperatures, and generally pleasant and sunny on the coast year round. Winter, from May to October is warm and dry. Summer from November to April is hot, humid and rainy. Cyclones occur between January and March. Sea breezes blow all year, especially on the east coast, and the inland central plateau around Curepipe is cooler and rainy year round. Tropical lightweights, with warmer wear for evenings and winter months. Rainwear advisable all year round. In the summer months, sun-care products and a hat are advisable and long sleeves and trousers to help prevent insect bites. Mauritius, a volcanic and mountainous island in the Indian Ocean, lies 2,000km (1,240 miles) off the south-eastern coast of Africa, due east of Madagascar. The island state stands on what was once a land bridge between Asia and Africa called the Mascarene Archipelago. From the coast, the land rises to form a broad fertile plain on which sugar cane flourishes and beyond, crater edges form a mountainous backbone. Some 500km (310 miles) east is Rodrigues Island, while northeast are the Cargados Carajos Shoals and 900km (560 miles) to the north is Agalega.",['MU'],1,['MUS']
3850,"Morocco's climate is very diverse, varying with the season and region. The climate is Mediterranean on the coasts, humid temperate at higher elevations, and hot and dry in the south-western part. Coastal cities in the north – Tangier, Rabat and Casablanca – all have a similar Mediterranean climate with hot and dry summers and relatively warm and wet winters. In Casablanca, August is often the hottest month with an average high of 30°C (86°F) and maybe 10mm (0.4in) of rain. January is slightly cooler, with an average high of 18°C (64°F). Rainfall is abundant from November to March. The best time to visit these coastal cities is from May to September as the period is warm and dry. Marrakech, which lies inland in the Tensift River valley, has a subtropical semi-desert with very hot summers and warm winters. Temperatures do fluctuate significantly between day and night. For more information, see the weather in Marrakech and the best time to go guide. The Atlas Mountains are popular from March to November, although the scorching heat between June and August may make travelling uncomfortable. Lightweight cottons and linens are best worn during summer, with a jacket for cooler evenings. In winter, pack light to medium-weight clothing. Waterproof gear may also be needed, depending on where and when you are going. Men and women should not wear revealing clothing in public – beachwear, sleeveless tops, shorts, and clingy clothing are acceptable by the hotel pool but not in public places. Morocco is located on the westernmost tip of north Africa, bordering the North Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea. It sits just 13km (8mi) away from Gibraltar and shares land borders with Algeria and the disputed territory Western Sahara, which is in the south. The interior of Morocco is mountainous. Like an elongated spine, the Atlas Mountains run from the southwest to the centre of Morocco, before extending eastward to Algeria and Tunisia, while the Rif Mountains run along the north coast. Often snow-covered in winter, Morocco's mountains are home to the country's significant indigenous Berber population, whose unique culture, crafts and costumes make for a fascinating visit. The long stretch of the Atlantic coast down Morocco's western side features a few vibrant cities – among them Tangier, Rabat, Casablanca, Essaouira and Agadir. The coastal part is separated from the mountainous region by wide swathes of fertile plains. The Sahara – Africa's largest desert – stretches its toes into southern Morocco. Far from being featureless, it is dotted with palm-fringed oases and traditional villages.",['MA'],1,['MAR']
3851,"Climate varies according to area. Inland is cooler than the coast and rainfall higher as the land rises, with most rain between January and March. Hottest and wettest season is October to March. From April to September the coast has warm, mainly dry weather tempered by sea breezes. Tropical lightweights, with warmer clothing for evenings. Rainwear advisable all year round. Mozambique borders Tanzania to the north, Zambia and Malawi to the northwest, Zimbabwe to the west, and South Africa and Swaziland to the southwest. To the east lies the Indian Ocean and a coastline of nearly 2,500km (1,550 miles) with beaches bordered by lagoons, coral reefs and strings of islands. Behind the coastline, a vast low plateau rising towards mountains in the west and north accounts for nearly half the area of Mozambique. The landscape of the plateau is savannah - more or less dry and open woodlands with tracts of short grass steppe. The western and northern highlands are patched with forest. The Zambezi is the largest and most important of the 25 main rivers which flow through Mozambique into the Indian Ocean. The major concentrations of population (comprising many different ethnic groups) are along the coast and in the fertile and relatively productive river valleys, notably in Zambezia and Gaza provinces. The Makua-Lomwe, who belong to the Central Bantu, live mainly in the area north of Zambezia, Nampula, Niassa and Cabo Delgado provinces. The Tsonga, who are the predominant race in the southern lowlands, provide a great deal of the labour for the South African mines. In the Inhambane coastal district are the Chopi and Tsonga, while in the central area are the Shona. The Makonde inhabit the far north. Mestizos and Asians live in the main populated area along the coast and in the more fertile river valleys.",['MZ'],1,['MOZ']
3852,"Namibia has a sub-tropical climate with most of the country enjoying a staggering 300 days of sunshine a year, making it a year-round destination. Along the coast, the cold Benguela Current keeps the area cool and rain-free year-round, but the air can be humid and when the water vapour condenses, dense fogs are formed, especially in early mornings, lending a mysterious edge to the area. In winter (July to September), temperatures along the coast can increase a few degrees when a hot dry wind (known as Berg Wind or Oosweer) blows from the inland to the coast. In the coastal town of Swakopmund, average highs range from 20°C (68°F) in July to 28°C (82°F) in February. Windhoek, Namibia's capital, perches at 1,700m (5,600ft) above sea level in the Khomas Highland plateau, almost exactly at the country's geographical centre. The official climate classification of Windhoek is semi-arid, meaning rainfall is infrequent, although the period between January to March sees an average of 80mm (3in) of rain each month. July is the coolest month with an average high of 21°C (70°F) and an average low of 7°C (45°F). On the other hand, January is the hottest month with an average high of 31°C (88°F) and an average low of 18°C (64°F). The Caprivi Strip has a unique tropical climate, with heavy rainfall that often leads to flooding between November and April. The wet season is a prime time for birdwatching as many migrating birds are present. On the contrary, June to September is dry, so animals tend to gather around waterholes and rivers to quench their thirst, making it an excellent time for game spotting. The Fish River Canyon, the largest canyon in Africa, lies in the south of Namibia. The highlight here is a five-day 90km (56mi) hiking trail along the canyon floor to the Ai-Ais Hot Springs, which you can only hike from mid-April to mid-September. The best time to visit Namibia depends on your activities. For travellers who prefer to avoid the intense heat of high summer (December to March), travelling during the winter months (May to August) is a good option. Birdwatchers may prefer to visit the Caprivi Strip between November to April, while the best time for safari-goers is from June to September. Light cottons and linens are best, with a jacket for cooler evenings. Sun hats, sunglasses, and sunscreen are essential. Neutral colours are recommended for safaris and game viewing, while ankle-height boots are recommended for hikers as there are poisonous snakes in the desert. Insect repellent is also useful during the rainy season or if you are visiting the Caprivi Strip. Namibia is a large, mostly arid country in southwest Africa. It borders Angola to the north, Botswana to the east, and South Africa to the south. In the northeast corner, the Caprivi Strip is a narrow panhandle of tropical Namibian territory juts towards Victoria Falls in Zambia. To the west is a 1,572km (977mi) long stretch of coastline, with the northern section shrouded in fog and littered with shipwrecks. The Namib, believed to be the world's oldest desert, runs along the coast of Namibia. The northern part of it lies the famous Skeleton Coast, an area where ships have run aground in thick fog that hovers below hot, dry air. To the south of the Skeleton Coast sits the Namib-Naukluft National Park, Namibia's largest conservation area, home to desert-adapted wildlife – including chacma baboons that can go for two weeks without drinking water and the Welwitschia plants that live for more than a thousand years in this harsh environment.",['NA'],1,['NAM']

Niger has borders with Libya and Algeria to the north, Chad to the east, Nigeria and Benin to the south, and Mali and Burkina Faso to the west. The capital, Niamey, stands on the north bank of the Niger River and has long been a major trading centre on this important navigable waterway. The river meanders for 500km (300 miles) through the southwestern corner of the country. To the east is a band of semi-arid bush country along the border with Nigeria, shrinking by 20km (12 miles) every year as over-grazing claims more land for the Ténéré Desert, which already occupies over half of Niger. This desert is divided by a range of low mountains, Aïr ou Azbine, in the eastern foothills of which lies the city of Agadez. Surrounded by green valleys and hot springs amid semi-desert, this regional capital is still a major terminus for Saharan caravans. The desert to the west of the mountains is a stony plain hosting seasonal pastures; to the north and west are mostly vast expanses of sand. There is arable land beside Lake Chad in the extreme southeastern corner of the country. The Hausa people live along the border with Nigeria and most are farmers. The Songhai and Djerma people live in the Niger valley and exist by farming and fishing. The nomadic Fulani have spread all over the Sahel. The robed and veiled Tuaregs once dominated the southern cities; the few who remain are camel herders and caravanners on the Saharan routes. The Manga (or Kanun) live near Lake Chad and are well known for their colourful ceremonies in which pipes and drums accompany slow, stately dancing.",['NE'],1,['NER']
3854,"Varies from area to area. The southern coast is hot and humid with a rainy season from March to November. During the dry season, the Harmattan wind blows from the Sahara.

Rainwear is essential during the rainy season. Nigeria has borders with Niger to the north, Chad (across Lake Chad) to the northeast, Cameroon to the east and Benin to the west. To the south, the Gulf of Guinea is indented by the Bight of Benin and the Bight of Biafra. The country's topography and vegetation vary considerably. The coastal region is a low-lying area of lagoons, sandy beaches and mangrove swamps, which merges into an area of rainforest where palm trees grow to over 30m (100ft). From here, the landscape changes to savannah and open woodland, rising to the Central Jos Plateau at 1,800m (6,000ft).

3856,"Despite its proximity to the equator (just 223km or 139 miles south of the equator), Rwanda's high altitude grants the country an agreeable climate year-round, with peak temperatures rarely climbing above 30°C (86°F) in the daytime or dropping below 15°C (59°F) at night. The long dry season is from June to mid-September, with July being the driest month. In addition, there are two annual rainy seasons, the first from mid-February to May and second from mid-September to December. Generally, the best time to visit Rwanda is during the long dry season from June to mid-September or the shorter second dry season from December to February. Visiting at the start or the end of the rainy seasons are ideal for travellers on a budget, with off-peak hotel rates and fewer crowds, as well as a chance of good, sunny weather. The best time to visit Kigali Kigali is a year-round destination with average highs ranging between 26°C (79°F) and 28°C (82°F). Hotels are usually busier during the peak season of June to September; although they offer good bargains during the rainy months, particularly from October to November, and from March to April. The best time to visit Volcanoes National Park The best time to visit Volcanoes National Park is during the dry season from June to mid-September, when paths are less muddy and easier to navigate. However, trekking permits are limited (to 96 per day) and are in high demand during this period, so book in advance. Gorilla treks do, however, run all year round, and the jungle is most luscious during the rainy season, which makes it a good time to visit for those who aren't fazed by getting wet. The best time to visit Akagera National Park The dry season (June-September) is the best time for spotting wildlife, as animals in the park gather at watering holes. Lightweights are required for most of the year with warmer clothes for cooler upland evenings. However, a waterproof jacket is advised, especially if visiting Volcanoes and Nyungwe National Parks. Long-sleeve clothing will help protect against mosquito bites (and therefore malaria) as well as sunburn. Rwanda is a small mountainous country in central Africa, bordered to the north by Uganda, to the east by Tanzania, to the south by Burundi and to the west by the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The country is divided by a mountain chain that runs across the country from north to south, but its highest peak is Mt Karisimbi (4,507m/14,787ft) in the Virunga Mountains, on the country's north-western border. South of Mt Karisimbi is Lake Kivu, which forms part of the western border with the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and is Rwanda's largest body of water. Central Rwanda features rolling hills giving way to savanna, plains, and swamps eastwards. Its capital, Kigali, is located in it the country's centre.",['RW'],1,['RWA']

3858,"Situated just above the equator, Senegal benefits from a warm and tropical climate, which sees temperatures hovering from warm to extremely hot throughout the year. There are two main seasons – dry and rainy. The dry season runs from October to June in the north and from November to May in the south. This is also known as the Harmattan season, characterised by the dry and dusty wind blows from the Sahara Desert over West Africa. The dry season is often considered as the best time to visit, particularly from December to March as the days are warm. See the information below on Petite Côte and Cap Skirring if you are going on a beach holiday. The rainy season runs from July to September in the north and from June to October in the south. This period is also known as hivernage or wintering – despite the name, temperatures only drop a few degrees and the weather is still hot and humid. As the African monsoon arrives from the south, expect abundant rainfall in the south, particularly around the Casamance region. Beware that during the rainy season, it can be challenging to travel by car, especially in the south. The best time to visit Dakar Located on the tip of the Cape Verde peninsula, Dakar enjoys a mild weather with little fluctuation in temperatures, with an average high of 25°C (77°F) to 31°C (88°F) year-round. The city receives good rainfall from June to October, with August being the wettest month. The best time to visit Dakar is from November to May. The best time to visit Petite Côte A popular tourist area, Petite Côte (Little Coast) runs from Dakar to la Pointe de Sangomar. The beaches here are sheltered from currents and has a calm sea. Weather wise, the period from June to October is wetter than other months. If you want to avoid the rain, the best time to visit is from December to May. February is the coolest month with an average high of 24°C (75°F) and an average low of 19°C (66°F). The best time to visit Cap Skirring Cap Skirring is another popular resort area. Located in the south, it gets a fair bit of rain from June to October with August being the wettest month, but it gets very little rain from November to May. As it is closer to the equator than the Dakar and Petite Côte, the sea temperatures here are warmer, averaging 22°F (72°F) even during the cooler months (from January to April). Accordingly, the best time to visit Cap Skirring is from December to May. Senegal's tropical and humid climate means casual lightweight cotton clothing is recommended year-round. Long pants or long skirts, along with long-sleeved tops, are ideal. Islam is the predominant religion but the society is tolerant. Senegalese women do not wear a full-face veil so female travellers don't have to cover up but do dress modestly. Casual wear is widely acceptable but swimwear should be reserved for the beach. Mosquitoes are another thing to consider when packing. The likelihood of bites is high, so apart from long sleeves, pack some high-strength mosquito repellent. If you'll be in the Casamance region during the wet season waterproofs are essential. Sturdy shoes are necessary for any trekking and hiking activities, otherwise, normal shoes and sandals will do. Located just above the equator, Senegal is bordered by the Republic of Guinea and Guinea-Bissau to the south, Mali to the east, Mauritania to the north, and completely encloses the confederated state of The Gambia. To the west lies the Atlantic Ocean. Most land is less than 100m (330ft) above sea level, with plains constituting the majority of the country's geography, apart from the Fouta Djallon foothills in the southeast and the Bambouk Mountains on the Mali border. On the coast between Dakar and St Louis is a strip of shifting dunes. South of Dakar there are shallow estuaries along the coastline, which is fringed by palm trees. In the northern part of the country, south of the Senegal Basin, lies the arid Fouta Ferlo, a hot dry Sahelian plain with little vegetation. Senegal also hosts many environmental features, such as the five rivers that run through the country, which are the Senegal River, Saloum River, Gambia River, Geba River and Casamance River. Furthermore, there are two major lakes in the country, being Lake Retba and Lac de Guiers.",['SN'],1,['SEN']
3859,"Lying just below the equator, Seychelles enjoys a warm tropical climate all year round. The weather is influenced by two monsoon seasons – Southeast and Northwest. Southeast Monsoon (June to September): The strong southeast trade winds bring a dry and slightly cooler weather to Seychelles, causing the average high in Mahé to dip two degrees to 28°C (82°F). Rainfall is also lower than other months, averaging 120mm (4.7 inches). The strong wind delights surfers, but not divers or swimmers as the sea is too choppy and dangerous. Northwest Monsoon (November to March): This is the rainy season, with December and January being the wettest months. Temperatures wise, the average high is around 30°C (86°F). The best time to visit Seychelles is during the transition months (April, May, and October). However, it must be said that April is hot and humid, with an average high of 32°C (90°F) and 170mm (7 inches) of rain. For the year-round warm weather, lightweight and cotton clothing is your best bet, with breathable waterproofs advisable during the rainy season. Sun hats, sunglasses and sunscreen are essential all year round. The Seychelles Archipelago occupies 400,000 square kilometres (154,400 square miles) of the Indian Ocean in the southern hemisphere, about 1,824km (1,133 miles) northeast of Madagascar. The archipelago comprises 115 granite and coral islands and atolls, most of which are inhabited. The Inner Islands refer to a collection of 43 islands clustering around Mahé, Praslin and La Digue. They are the political, cultural and economic hub of Seychelles. Unsurprisingly, 99% of the population live on the Inner Islands. 50% of Seychelles' landmass is protected as national parks and reserves, providing a sanctuary for some of the rarest species of flora and fauna on earth. Keep a lookout for Coco-de-mer, the jellyfish tree, paradise flycatcher, Seychelles warbler, Aldabra giant tortoise, to name but a few.",['SC'],1,['SYC']
3860,"The climate is tropical and humid all year. Between November and June, it is very hot and dry, although the coastal areas are cooled by sea breezes. In December, January and February the dry, dusty Harmattan wind blows from the Sahara. Rainfall can be torrential during the rainy season between May and November. In March there are sporadic rains, accompanied by strong winds, in the provinces when the heat of the dry season reaches its peak. If you decide to travel to the provinces during the month of March, it is advisable to bring waterproof clothing to avoid getting drenched when you least expect it. August has the most rainfall, and it is best avoided if you are looking for a sun-soaked holiday on Sierra Leone’s beautiful beaches, but it is also the time when wildlife activity is at its peak and therefore a period of the year that attracts a lot of nature lovers. There are no restrictions on clothing for men or women, with casual attire such as sleeveless shirts, flip flops and sandals the norm. Lightweight and light-coloured, cotton clothing is recommended due to the hot and humid climate. During the rainy season, it is advisable to wear wet-weather clothing, while a light jersey or jacket may be needed in the months when the Harmattan winds blow. Sierra Leone is bordered to the northwest, north and northeast by the Republic of Guinea, and to the southeast by Liberia. To the south and southwest lies the Atlantic Ocean. A flat plain up to 110km (70 miles) wide stretches the length of the coast except for the Freetown peninsula, where the Lion Mountains rise to 888m (2,913ft). In some coastal areas, sand bars have formed that stretch out as far as 112km (70 miles). Behind the coastal plain is the central forested area, drained by eight principal rivers, which has been cleared for agriculture. The land rises in altitude eastwards to the Guinea Highlands, a high plateau with peaks rising to over 1,830m (6,000ft) in the Loma Mountains and Tingi Hills area. The Mende tribe is prominent in the southeast and the Temne in the western and northern areas.",['SL'],1,['SLE']

Hagaa, during August, is a time of dry monsoon winds and dust clouds. The second rainy season is from September to December and is called Dayr. Lightweights and rainwear. Somalia is bordered to the north by the Gulf of Aden, to the south and west by Kenya, to the west by Ethiopia and to the northwest by Djibouti. To the east lies the Indian Ocean. Somalia is a semi-arid country and the scenery includes mountains in the north, flat semi-desert plains in the interior and a subtropical region in the south. Separated from the sea by a narrow coastal plain, the mountains slope south and west to the central, almost waterless plateau which makes up most of the country. The beaches are protected by a coral reef that runs from Mogadishu to the Kenyan border in the south.",['SO'],1,['SOM']
3862,"Being in the southern hemisphere, South Africa’s seasons are the opposite of European seasons. The climate is seasonal, but the country enjoys at least seven months of sunshine, with temperatures dropping in the winter months of May to August. April and May are the most temperate months. Temperatures above 32°C (90°F) are fairly common in summer, and frequently exceed 38°C (100°F) in the lower Orange River Valley and the Mpumalanga Lowveld. The barren Northern Cape has some of the most extreme temperatures, sometimes cracking 40°C (104°F) in summer and plummeting to below freezing in winter. It's pleasantly warm and sunny in spring and autumn, and delightfully hot in summer (November-March) with frequent heavy tropical rains and sudden spring and summer hailstorms to cool things down. The thunder and lightning storms over Africa's big skies can be quite spectacular, but are best enjoyed through a window, not out in the open. These tropical storms can be vicious too, often causing flooding and turning urban streets into temporary streams, making driving hazardous. Wait an hour and it will all be over. Even in winters South Africa’s chill is nothing compared with European standards, with mild frost occasional, and snow a rarity. The rainiest months in Cape Town are May to August, although the weather in Cape Town is generally difficult to predict and can deliver all four seasons in one day. Christmas can be just too hot for game viewing in the safari parks, and it's also peak season for South African holidaymakers. Cape Town is a magnet for Jo'burgers at Christmas, so best avoided - visit in spring and autumn, when the weather is good and the crowds are smaller. Of the main cities, Durban is the hottest and can get remarkably hot and sticky in the summer. But it’s perfect in winter, where you can still wear shorts in temperatures that the locals consider a bit nippy. For summer in Africa you’ll need to keep cool, so pack lightweight clothes. In winter you’ll be surprised at how cold it can be in some areas, so bring a jumper or sweatshirt. You will never need a heavy coat or jacket, but a light raincoat can be useful, especially in Cape Town. For a safari bring long sleeves and long trousers, if only to protect against mosquitoes and thorn bushes. The game drives will either start out chilly with an 0600 start and end under the blazing sun, or vice versa, with a hot late afternoon start and a return after sunset, so take a wrap or pullover of some sort. The Republic of South Africa fills the southern tip of the continent and is lapped by the Atlantic Ocean to the west and the Indian Ocean to the east, and a swirling mixture of the two at the very tip. It totally encloses the independent kingdom of Lesotho, and is bordered by Namibia, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Mozambique and Swaziland to the north. A vast, interior plateau has sharp escarpments that rise above the lowland plains. Mountainous regions include the Drakensberg and Magaliesberg. The west coast is arid, while the south and southeast coasts are semi-arid, with vegetation fringed by sandy beaches and rocky coves. In contrast, the subtropical northeast has lush wetlands and coastal forests. The wildlife viewing areas are scattered throughout the country, with the famous Kruger National Park so vast that it encloses a wide variety of eco-systems.  Of its nine provinces, Gauteng, which houses Johannesburg and Pretoria in the northeast, is the smallest and most densely populated. The Northern Cape is the largest province covering between a third and quarter of the country, but containing only a tiny percentage of the population in this territory of desert and semi-desert wilderness.",['ZA'],1,['ZAF']
3863,"Extremely hot (less so November to March). Sandstorms blow across the Sahara from April to September. In the extreme north, there is little rain but the central region has some rainfall from July to August. The southern region has much higher rainfall, the wet season lasting May to October. Summers are very hot throughout the country, whilst winters are cooler in the north. Tropical clothes all year, warmer clothes for cool mornings and evenings (especially in the desert). Sudan is bordered by Egypt to the north, the Red Sea to the northeast, Ethiopia and Eritrea to the east, South Sudan to the south, the Central African Republic and Chad to the west, and Libya to the northwest. There is a marked difference between the climate, culture and geography of northern and southern Sudan. The far north consists of the contiguous Libyan and Nubian deserts which extend as far south as the capital, Khartoum, and are barren except for small areas beside the Nile River and a few scattered oases. This gives way to the central steppes which cover the country between 15°N and 10°N, a region of short, coarse grass and bushes, turning to open savannah towards the south, largely flat to the east but rising to two large plateaux in the west and south, the Janub Darfur (3,088m/10,131ft) and Janub Kordofan (500m/1,640ft) respectively. Most of Sudan's agriculture occurs in these latitudes in a fertile pocket between the Blue and White Niles which meet at Khartoum. South of the steppes is a vast shallow basin traversed by the White Nile, and the border with South Sudan.",['SD'],1,['SDN']
3864,"The climate is tropical and coastal areas are hot and humid, while the northwestern highlands are cool and temperate. There are two rainy seasons; the short rains are generally from October to December, while the long rains last from March to June. The central plateau tends to be dry and arid throughout the year.Tanzania can be visited year-round, although the best time for travelling is outside of the rainy season between June and October, when temperatures stay well below their summer peaks. Beach side locations like Zanzibar can be fine to visit during the hotter months of December to January, when ocean breezes make the high temperatures bearable (though humidity can still be high). However, this is also the time popular for typical beach holidays, especially for those travelling from Europe wanting some winter sunshine, and hotels can book up early especially for the Christmas and New Year period. Tropical clothing is worn throughout the year, but in the cooler season, from June to September, jackets and sweaters may be needed, especially in the evenings. Clothing appropriate to temperatures below zero is required on the higher slopes of Kilimanjaro and Meru. Also note that it can get very cold at night on the rim of the Ngorongoro Crater and early morning game drives may be chilly before the sun comes up. The United Republic of Tanzania lies on the east coast of Africa and is bordered by Kenya and Uganda to the north; by Burundi, Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo to the west; by the Indian Ocean to the east; and by Zambia, Malawi and Mozambique to the south. The Tanzanian mainland is divided into several clearly defined regions: the coastal plains, which vary in width from 16 to 64km (10 to 39 miles) and have lush, tropical vegetation; the Masai Steppe in the north, 213 to 1,067m (698 to 3,500ft) above sea level, which gives rise to two prominent mountains, Kilimanjaro, 5,895m (19,341ft) above sea level and Africa's highest peak, and Mount Meru, 4,565m (14,973ft); and there's a high plateau known as the Southern Highlands in the southern area towards Zambia and Lake Malawi. Savannah and bush cover over half the country, and semi-desert accounts for the remaining land area, with the exception of the coastal plains. Over 53,000 sq km (20,463 sq miles) is inland water, mostly lakes formed in the Rift Valley and Tanzania's share of Lake Victoria and Lake Tanganyika, both on its western border. Lake Victoria covers 69,490 sq km (26,832 sq miles), which is Africa's largest lake and 49% of it lies in Tanzania. With maximum depths of 1,470m (4,821ft), Lake Tanganyika is estimated to be the deepest lake in Africa and is 673km (420 miles) long and averages 50km (31 miles) across; 41% of its area lies in Tanzania.

3866,"The areas of northern Tunisia that draw the most tourists have a typical Mediterranean climate, with hot, dry summers and mild, occasionally rainy winters. Along with destinations like Egypt and Turkey, Tunisia has claimed a good slice of the Mediterranean summer holiday market, making June to August a popular time for coastal resorts. Spring and autumn both offer their own enticements though, both in terms of an appealing climate and a lessening of tourist traffic. This is the best time to visit the desert regions of the south and central Tunisia, as in summer the temperatures can climb to stifling heights, whilst in winter the Sahara can be bitterly cold at night. Winter is low season in Tunisia and hotel prices often drop during the months of December to February. There are still plenty of sun-filled days but temperatures drop substantially once the sun has set and you need to come prepared for rain. If you’re visiting Tunis, December to March are the rainy season so pack an umbrella with you. May is a lovely time to visit as temperatures averaging 21C (70F). July and August are dry, but hot, averaging 28C (83F). Sousse, located on the Gulf of Hammamet, has largely the same weather pattern as Tunis, though it is slightly cooler in comparison. If you are travelling in summer, lightweight clothing made from natural fibres such as cotton and linen are best to cope with the heat. Unless you will be exclusively staying on a resort, pack some longer sleeved tops, and long trousers or skirts for off-the-beach wear. In winter you'll need a rain jacket and a warm pullover to put on for the evenings. It's a good idea to bring these if you're travelling in spring and autumn as well. The Republic of Tunisia lies on the North African coast, 130km (80 miles) southwest of Sicily and 160km (100 miles) due south of Sardinia. Dwarfed by its neighbours, sandwiched between Algeria to the west and Libya to the east, Tunisia is just over 163,000 sq km in size. It may be small but Tunisia has a landscape which varies from the cliffs of the north coast, to the woodland of the interior, from desert to rich, arable land, and from mountains to salt pans below sea level. The 1,148 km (713 miles) Mediterranean coastline is dotted with small islands, notably Djerba in the south and Kerkennah in the east. The coastline is backed by lush pasture, orchards, vineyards and olive groves and is the most populous area of the country. The north of the country is increasingly mountainous with rolling pine-clad hills a large feature of the landscape. South of Gafsa and Gabès the central region's countryside becomes starker with semi-arid plains as the Sahara begins to exert its influence. The desert region of the Sahara is one of Tunisia's most famous features. Its diverse environment of mammoth salt pans, vast sand plains and towering dunes, interspersed with lush oases forms the landscape of the south.",['TN'],1,['TUN']

Most regions of Uganda, apart from the dry area in the north, have an annual rainfall of between 1,000mm and 1,500mm. There is heavy rain between March and May and between September and November, making road travel difficult in parts of the country. The best time for trekking is during the dry seasons, between January and February and June to August. Wildlife viewing is best at the end of the dry seasons, when game is more concentrated around water sources.   Lightweight clothes with a warm cover-up for the evenings are advised. Short or revealing clothes should be avoided - women should avoid shorts in particular. Knee-length skirts or dresses are more acceptable. Take a pair of good walking shoes or boots for forest trekking, and long-sleeved tops to protect against mosquitoes. If you’re planning to go to mountainous areas, be sure to take warm clothing, as temperatures drop substantially. White clothes won’t stay white for long with Uganda’s red dust roads, so go for darker colours. Travellers can also pick up bargains at second-hand clothes markets in Kampala, Jinja and Fort Portal, which sell trousers, boots and fleeces. Landlocked, Uganda lies between the eastern and western sections of Africa’s Great Rift Valley. The country shares borders with South Sudan to the north, Kenya to the east, Lake Victoria to the southeast, Tanzania and Rwanda to the south and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) to the west.

Mountainous regions include the Rwenzori Mountains that run along the border with the DRC, the Virunga Mountains on the border with Rwanda and the DRC, and Kigezi in the southwest of the country. An extinct volcano, Mount Elgon, straddles the border with Kenya. The capital city, Kampala, lies on the shores of Lake Victoria, the largest lake in Africa and second-largest freshwater inland body of water in the world. Jinja, located on the lake, is considered to be the start point of the River Nile, which traverses much of the country.

3875,"Being located in the tropical zone north of the equator, Cambodia has a monsoon climate. Monsoon season runs May - November, meaning that the most pleasant season for visitors is generally the dry season, stretching from November/December - April. Immediately after the monsoon, the blanketing green of the countryside can be stunningly beautiful. In the north, winters are generally colder, while throughout most of the country temperatures remain fairly constant. The average year-round temperature in Cambodia is 27.7°C (the highest monthly average being 35°C, the lowest monthly average being 21°C). There is often seasonal flooding in Phnom Penh and the rest of Cambodia in late July and early August, and, because the majority of roads are dirt, travel may be disrupted at these times. At the peak of the wet season it can rain as often as two in every three days. While the rain may affect certain outdoor activities when travelling (many hiking, biking or boat cruise companies will cancel excursions), the temperature is pleasant and in the larger cities the rainfall acts as a burst of refreshment for the dusty roads. Do bear in mind when hiking during the region in monsoon season that leeches are plentiful; leech socks and regular leech checks en route are advisable. Lightweight clothing is worn all year. Gumboots, umbrellas and raincoats are advisable during the monsoon season - because when it rains, it pours. Rain may continue solidly for days on end. Bordered to the west by Thailand, to the north by Laos and to the east by Vietnam, Cambodia is a roughly circular country with a southern coastline giving onto the Gulf of Thailand. The landscape comprises tropical rainforest and fertile cultivated land, with lush highlands rising in both the northeast and southeast.

Inland and around the mountainous regions, temperatures average at 26°C (79°F) while the coastal regions averaging 28°C (82°F). While temperatures are relatively constant, rains do not follow the similar pattern. In general, Indonesia also has two monsoon seasons: the northeast monsoon (December to March) and the southwest monsoon (June to September). These monsoon seasons either bring an abundance of rainfall or a dry spell, depending on the geographical region you are visiting. Jakarta: the sprawling capital of Indonesia is situated on the northwest coast of Java and is sheltered from the south-west monsoon. Jakarta has a tropical monsoon climate and is characterised by one long wet season, which runs from October to May and a short dry season, which runs from June throughout September. Year-round, the temperature is warm, with an average high temperature of 31°C (88°F) and an annual average low temperature of 26°C (79°F). The prime time to experience Jakarta is from June to mid-October, during the dry season when the skies are clear. Bali: Bali allures tourists with its beautiful beaches, forested volcanic mountains and cultural sites. Located a few degrees south of the equator, this island experiences a tropical climate throughout the year. The rainy season is from November to May while the relatively dry season (some showers are still likely) is from June to October. The dry season is a good time to see Bali at its best, as there is little rain, low humidity and plenty of sunshine, with an average high of 31°C (88°F). Avid surfers can enjoy Bali's breaks all-year-round, but the best months for surfing is during the dry season. Sumatra: the island of Sumatra receives abundant rainfall throughout the year. Medan, the capital of North Sumatra province, has a tropical climate with no real dry season, although February is slightly drier than the other months. Palembang, the capital of South Sumatra province, also sees plenty of rain throughout the year, although July is slightly drier than the other months. Given the year-round tropical climate and humidity of Indonesia, lightweight and loose clothing, including cottons and silks, are recommended. Rainwear is essential, and a jacket might be needed due to the rough winds along the coast or in the mountains. Warmer clothes can be necessary for the cooler evenings and highland areas – thicker cotton and woollen garments work best. It is regarded as inappropriate for swimwear to be worn anywhere other than the beach or at sports facilities. To avoid sunburn or sunstroke, wearing a hat and sunscreen are advised. When visiting temples or other religious sites, you should wear clothing that covers your arms, shoulders and legs. Indonesia lies between the mainland of Southeast Asia and Australia in the Indian and Pacific oceans. It is the world's largest archipelago country. Indonesia is made up of five main islands - Sumatra, Java, Sulawesi, Kalimantan (part of the island of Borneo) and New Guinea - and 30 smaller archipelagos. In total, the Indonesian archipelago consists of about 18,307 islands according to the National Institute of Aeronautics and Space; 6,000 of these are inhabited and stretch over 4,828km (3,000 miles), most lying in a volcanic belt with more than 400 volcanoes, the great majority of which are extinct. The landscape varies from island to island, ranging from high mountains and plateaux to coastal lowlands and alluvial belts. The high incidence of volcanoes in Indonesia is due to its location along a stretch of the Pacific Ring of Fire. The collision of various tectonic plates means that around 90% of the world's earthquakes occur within this area, with Indonesia suffering from frequent earthquakes and volcano eruptions.",['ID'],1,['IDN']
3877,"The climate in Japan is mostly temperate with four distinct seasons, except for the Hokkaido area and the Okinawa region. Tokyo, on the main Honshu island, has a humid subtropical climate characterised by warm and wet summers and mild winters. January is usually the coldest month with temperatures averaging 5°C (41°F) while August is the hottest month with an average high reaching 31°C (88°F). The summer heat, along with high humidity levels, can make travelling uncomfortable. Precipitation in Tokyo amounts to 1,530mm (60in) a year, meaning rainfall is abundant (especially from June to October), so umbrellas or raincoats are essential. For more information, see the weather in Tokyo and the best time to go guide. Hokkaido, the northernmost island, is also Japan's coldest region. Winters are long and harsh with plenty of snowfall, making it a prime destination for snow sports. Ski resorts here often open from early December to April. Sapporo, Hokkaido's capital and host of the 1972 Winter Olympic Games, has an average temperature of -3°C (27°F) in February, so wrap up warm if you visit during this period. On the other hand, the Okinawa prefecture is about 1,600km (1,000mi) south of Tokyo. The archipelago here enjoys a sub-tropical climate with very mild but rainy winters. Summers here are long, usually lasting from May to September, with average highs swing between 27-32°C (81-90°F). Typhoons can hit Japan, most likely during August and September but can occur from June to October. They bring strong winds and torrential rains. Powerful typhoons may damage buildings and cause transport disruptions. There is a danger of landslides in rural areas too. In general, the best time to visit Japan is from March to May, and from late September to November. April is recommended for visitors who are after the spectacular views of cherry blossoms. Equally, October is the month for those in search of colourful autumnal leaves. Most visitors avoid the summer months as they are rainy and muggy. In Japan, lightweight cottons and linens are required throughout summer in most areas. To avoid sunstroke and sunburn, it is advisable to wear a hat. Summer is also the wettest period in many parts of Japan, so take an umbrella or a raincoat. Depending on the region, light to medium weight clothing is best during spring and autumn, while medium to heavyweight clothing is recommended for winter months. Much warmer clothes will be needed in the mountains all year round. Thermal innerwear is recommended if trekking, climbing or skiing. The archipelago of Japan is separated from the Asian mainland by the Sea of Japan and split into four main islands: Honshu, Hokkaido, Kyushu and Shikoku. About 70% of the country is covered by hills and mountains, a number of which are active or dormant volcanoes, including Mount Fuji, Japan's highest peak, reaching 3,776m (12,388ft). Japan sits on major seismic fault lines and is susceptible to frequent earthquakes. A series of mountain ranges run from northern Hokkaido to southern Kyushu. The Japanese Alps (the most prominent range) run in a north-south direction through central Honshu. Lowlands and plains are small and scattered, mostly lying along the coast, and composed of alluvial lowlands and diluvial uplands. The coastline is long and has very varied features. For example, the deeply indented bays with good natural harbours tend to be adjacent to mountainous terrain. Many of Japan's major cities are located on the coastline and have an extremely high population density. Okinawa, a chain of islands in the East China Sea, is Japan's southernmost prefecture. Geographically, it is closer to Taiwan than to the four main Japanese islands. Its distinct subtropical climate and pristine beaches are the main drawcards.",['JP'],1,['JPN']
3878,"Continental climate with cold winters and hot summers. Although Kazakhstan has some of the highest peaks in the CIS, the climate is fairly dry. The hottest month is July (August in mountain regions). Five times the size of France and half the size of the USA, Kazakhstan is the second largest state in the Commonwealth of Independent States, and is bordered by the Russian Federation to the north and west, the Caspian Sea, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan to the southwest, Kyrgyzstan to the south and China to the southeast. 90% of the country is made up of steppe, the sand massives of the Kara Kum and the vast desert of Kizilkum, while in the southeast of the country the mountains of the Tian Shan and the Altai form a great natural frontier with tens of thousands of lakes and rivers. Lake Balkhash is the country's largest expanses of water, since the Aral Sea dried up.",['KZ'],1,['KAZ']
3879,"The best time to visit Kyrgyzstan is between May and October as getting around outside this period can be difficult. Trekking is best between June and September, although July and August are the busiest times for foreign visitors. The south of the country, and even Bishkek, can be uncomfortably warm at this time of year, so if these are the prime destinations to be visited, spring or autumn may be a better choice. The landlocked nation of Kyrgyzstan is bordered to the north by Kazakhstan, to the west by Uzbekistan, and to the south and east by Tajikistan and China. The majestic Tien Shan (Heavenly Mountains) range occupies the greater part of the area and 90% of the country stands above 1,500m, with 71% above 2,000m. The highest peak in Kyrgyzstan is Pik Pobedy at 7,439m (24,406ft) and the lowest point is Kara-Daryya at 132m (433ft). Kyrgyzstan is also home to several sizeable lakes, by far the largest being Lake Issyk-Kul in the northwest of the country, which stands at 1,606m (5,269 ft) above sea level and is the second largest alpine lake in the world. The climate is extreme and varied, ranging from dry continental to polar in the high Tien Shan, from subtropical in the southwest to temperate in the northern foothill zone.",['KG'],1,['KGZ']
3880,"Throughout the country, the climate is hot and tropical, with the rainy season between May and October when temperatures are at their highest, up to 35°C. The weather is very similar to that of northern Vietnam. The dry season runs from November to April, which is the best time to visit as the temperature is at its most comfortable. However, the mountainous areas can be very cold at this time, down to around 5°C. Across Asia the annual monsoon is becoming ever more difficult to predict, possibly as a result of global warming. This plays havoc with farming and occasionally travel plans too. As a guide, the average rainfall in the capital Vientiane is about 1,700 mm, although in the north of Laos and the highlands it is far wetter, with more than 3,000 mm each year. Lightweights and rainwear, with warmer layers from October to March and for upland areas. If you come during the monsoon summer months, bring lightweight waterproofs, an umbrella and some leech oil for trekking. Bring a swimming costume for hotel swimming pools too. Laos is a landlocked country encircled to the north by China, to the south by Cambodia, Vietnam to the east, to the west by Thailand along with a 235km-long (146 miles) Mekong River border with Burma. Apart from the Mekong River plains, along the border to Thailand, the country is mountainous, particularly in the north, and in places is densely forested. The western border is demarcated by the Mekong River – which along with the tributaries covers about 20% of the land mass. Laos is mainly mountainous, with steep terrain, tapered river valleys. The mountains stretch across the north, except for around Vientiane and the Plain of Jars in Xiangkhoang Province. These mountains are sparsely populated by tribal minorities who traditionally have not acknowledged the border with Vietnam any more than lowland Lao have been constrained by the 1,754km (1,090 miles) Mekong River border with Thailand. Thus, ethnic minority populations are found on both the Laotian and Vietnamese sides of the frontier. Because of their relative isolation, contact between these groups and lowland Lao has been mostly confined to trading. Migration and conflict have affected the ethnic structure of the country and to the geographic distribution of its ethnic groups.",['LA'],1,['LAO']
3881,"The best time for beach holidays or scuba-diving will depend on which part of Malaysia you intend to visit. The country is affected by the south-west monsoon from May to September and the north-east monsoon from November to March, and different parts of the country have their dry and wet seasons at different times of year. On the west coast, the wettest months are May to October, while on the east coast, the wettest months are September to December. Kuala Lumpur is wettest from March to April and September to November, while Malaysian Borneo sees its heaviest rainfall between November and February. The best time to visit for dry weather is June and July on the east coast, January and February on the west coast, April in Sabah and June to July in Sarawak. Lightweight, loose-fitting clothes are sensible at any time of year. To avoid offending local sensibilities, female travellers should wear clothes that cover the legs and upper arms. Note that shorts are rarely worn by adults, except at the beach. Full-length trousers will create a better impression. Because of the rainfall patterns and the vagaries of Malaysia weather, always carry an umbrella. Malaysia is situated in central South-East Asia, bordering Thailand in the north, with Singapore to the south and Indonesia to the south and west. It is composed of Peninsular Malaysia and the states of Sabah and Sarawak on the north coast of the island of Borneo, 650 to 950km (404 to 600 miles) across the South China Sea. Peninsular Malaysia is an area of forested mountain ranges running north-south, on either side of which are low-lying coastal plains. The coastline extends some 1,900km (1,200 miles). The west coast consists of mangrove swamps and mudflats which separate into bays and inlets. In the west, the plains have been cleared and cultivated, while the unsheltered east coast consists of tranquil beaches backed by dense jungle. The major islands are Langkawi (a group of 99 islands), Penang and Pangkor off the west coast; and Tioman, Redang, Kapas, Perhentian and Rawa off the east coast. In Malaysian Borneo, Sarawak has alluvial and, in places, swampy coastal plains with rivers penetrating the jungle-covered hills and mountains of the interior. Sabah has a narrow coastal plain which gives way to mountains and jungle. Mt Kinabalu, at 4,094m (13,432ft), is the highest peak in Malaysia.",['MY'],1,['MYS']
3882,"The Maldives has a year-round hot tropical climate. The Maldives has two distinct and dominating seasons: a dry season (November to April), punctuated with northeast winter monsoons, and a wet season (May to October) associated with southwest monsoons and strong winds. Generally, the southwest brings more wind and rain in June and July. Due to this, this time is popular with surfers, as areas see bigger waves and larger swells. January to April is typically known as peak season, as they have little rain and low humidity. Due to this, hotel and resorts prices will increase during this period. The temperature rarely falls below 25°C (77°F). Lightweight cottons and linens throughout the year. Light waterproofs are advised during the rainy season. More modest clothing when visiting local villages and cities outside of the resorts. The Republic of Maldives consists of about 1,190 low-lying coral islands, of which only 200 are inhabited. Most of the inhabited islands are covered by lush tropical vegetation and palm trees, while the numerous uninhabited islands, some of which are mere sand spits or coral tips, are covered in shrubs. Each island is surrounded by a reef enclosing a shallow lagoon. Hundreds of these islands, together with other coral growth, form an atoll, surrounding a lagoon. All the islands are low-lying, none more than 2.4m (7.9ft) above sea level.",['MV'],1,['MDV']
3883,"Mongolia has a continental climate with long, cold winters and short, warm summers. Temperatures vary wildly from season to season. Much of the country is a large plateau with an average elevation of 915m to 1,524m (3,000ft to 5,000ft) and subject to strong winds, especially in spring. The best time to visit Mongolia is from May to September when the days are warm – but do bring waterproofs as this period is also rainy. Ulaanbaatar is the capital and sits at 1,300m (4,250ft) above sea level. Due to its elevation and latitude, spring arrives late in April in Ulaanbaatar. The average high in April is 8°C (46°F) while the average low is -5°C (23°F). Summer is warm but rainy – June is the wettest month with 50mm (11 inches) of rain in one month. Temperatures drop quickly after September and by November, the average high is below freezing at -5°C (23°F). Winter is cold – Ulaanbaatar is the coldest capital city in the world on average. In January, the average high is -16°C (3°F) while the average low is -29°C (-20°F). The Gobi Desert is located in the south of Mongolia; hence it is slightly warmer than Ulaanbaatar. In Sainshand, in the eastern Gobi desert steppe, July is the warmest month with an average high of 29°C (84°F) and an average low of 17°C (63°F). Temperatures drop quickly after September too and by January, the average high is -12°C (10°C) and the average low is -23°C (-9°F). Bring layers, mediumweight clothing and waterproofs if you are visiting Mongolia from May to September. Bring heavyweight clothing (a parka, woollen beanie, gloves, boots) from October to April. Mongolia has a 3,485km (2,165-mile) border with the Russian Federation in the north and a 4,677km (2,906-mile) border with China in the south. Much of the country is a large plateau with an average elevation of 915m to 1,524m (3,000ft to 5,000ft). Then there are three mountain ranges - Altai Mountains dominate the northern and western areas, the Khangai Mountains is almost at the centre but more towards to the west, while Khentii Mountains in north-eastern Mongolia. The Gobi Desert, a rocky desert with a thin layer of shifting sand, covers the southern part of the country. The Khülten Peak, within the Altai Mountains range, is the highest peak at 4,374m (14,350ft). Hoh Nuur, a lake, is the lowest point that lies at 560m (1,837ft) in the east. There are several hundred lakes in the country as well as numerous rivers, of which the Orkhon River is the longest at 1,124km (698 miles).",['MN'],1,['MNG']
3884,"Myanmar has a monsoon climate with three main seasons. The hottest period is between February and May, when there is little or no rain and temperatures can rise above 40°C (104°F). The rainy season is generally from May to October, giving way to dry, cooler weather from October to February. The coast and the mountains see significantly more rainfall than the arid central plains, which include Mandalay and Bagan, and roads can become impassable during the rainy season in those areas. Overall, the best months to visit are from November to February. The only notable downside (other than the fact that places are busy with other tourists) is that river travel can be slow as water levels are low, meaning that boats have to travel more slowly; this is particularly notable on long journeys as ferries cannot travel overnight for fear of being grounded on sandbanks. Lightweight cottons and linens are recommended throughout most of the year. A light raincoat or umbrella is needed during the rainy season. Warmer clothes are advised for cooler season and some evenings, particularly in hilly areas, on ferries or for trips on Inle Lake. It's also a good idea to wrap up when travelling on buses, as the drivers tend to overuse the air-conditioning. Myanmar is roughly diamond-shaped – with a long southeastern ‘tail’ – and extends 925km (575 miles) from east to west and 2,100km (1,300 miles) from north to south. It is bounded by China, Laos and Thailand in the east, by Bangladesh and India in the north and by the Indian Ocean in the west and south. The Irrawaddy River runs through the centre of the country and fans out to form a delta on the south coast; Yangon stands beside one of its many mouths. North of the delta lies the Irrawaddy basin and the arid plains of central Myanmar, which are protected by a horseshoe of mountains rising to over 3,000m (10,000ft). To the west are the Arakan mountains and the Chin, Naga and Patkai Hills; the Kachin Hills are to the north; to the east lies the Shan Plateau, which extends to the Tenasserim coastal ranges. The Kachin range includes Southeast Asia’s highest mountain, Hkakabo Razi which reaches 5,881m (19,295ft). Intensive irrigated farming is practised throughout central Myanmar, and fruit, vegetables and citrus crops thrive on the Shan Plateau. Much of the land and mountains are covered by subtropical forest, although this coverage has been reduced by extensive logging particularly for teak.",['MM'],1,['MMR']
3885,"Monsoon season begins around the end of June and lasts until the end of September. About 80% of Nepal's annual rainfall is during that period, so the remainder of the year is pretty dry. Spring and autumn are the most pleasant seasons; winter temperatures drop to freezing, with a high level of snowfall in the mountains, while high summer can be blisteringly hot. Summer and late spring temperatures range from 28ºC (83ºF) in the hill regions to more than 40ºC (104ºF) in the Terai. In winter, average maximum and minimum temperatures in the Terai range from a brisk 7ºC (45ºF) to a mild 23ºC (74ºF). The central valleys experience a minimum temperature often falling bellow freezing point and a chilly 12ºC (54ºF) maximum. Much colder temperatures prevail at higher elevations. The Kathmandu Valley, at an altitude of 1,310m (4,297ft), has a mild climate, ranging from 19-27ºC (67-81ºF) in summer, and 2-20ºC (36-68ºF) in winter. Lightweight and tropical clothes with umbrella are advised for June to August. Between October and March, lightweight clothes are worn in Kathmandu, with a coat for evenings and warm clothing for the mountains. When trekking in the mountains, high quality trekking gear that can handle minus temperatures is recommended all year round. Nepal is a landlocked kingdom sharing borders with Tibet to the north and India to the west, south and east. The country can be divided into six zones: the Terai, the Chure hills, the Mahabharat range, the Pahar zone, the Himalaya and the Trans-Himalaya. The greater part of the country lies on the southern slope of the Himalayas, extending down from the highest peaks through hill country to the upper edge of the Ganges Plain. The hilly central area is crossed by the Lower Himalayas, where there are eight of the highest peaks in the world, leading up to Mount Everest. Wildlife in Nepal includes tigers, leopards, gaur, elephants, buffalo, deer and rhinos.",['NP'],1,['NPL']
3886,"Moderate with four distinct seasons. The hottest time is July to August, which is also the rainy season; coldest is from December to January, winters in the far north can be very severe.

Intensive water and soil conservation programmes, including land reclamation from the sea, are given high priority. The eastern coast is rocky and steep with mountains rising from the water and this area contains most of the waterways.",['KP'],1,['PRK']
3887,"Pakistan has three seasons: winter (November to March) is warm and cooled by sea breezes on the coast; summer (April to July) has extreme temperatures and the monsoon season (July to September) has the highest rainfall on the hills. Karachi has little rain. Global warming is starting to become apparent in Pakistan with warmer winters, glacial melt and a slight dip in temperature in the summer months.The best time to visit southern Pakistan is between November and March, when the days are cool and clear. The best time to visit northern Pakistan, for trekking, is from April to October; outside of these months it will be snowy and very difficult to reach many mountainous places. Bear in mind that the monsoon plays havoc with travel in Pakistan and is not to be taken lightly, as we have witnessed recently with the devastating floods of 2010, which were the worst in 80 years. Wear lightweights, with warmer clothing, including base-layers and woollens, for upland areas in the winter. Good trekking boots are a must for mountain explorers, as are walking poles and thermals. Visitors can buy woollen socks and sweaters at a very good price in the bazaars of Pakistan, but they might not be up to western standards and will be quite heavy. Rainwear is advised for the monsoon season so if you are to spend any time in the cities during this time, do not rule out the possibility of bringing along some wellington boots as the rain can be torrential resulting in very flooded lanes. It's easiest to buy the necessary shalwar kameez (tunic and baggy trousers) when you land in Pakistan - this is essential for women, and optional, but advisable for the heat more than anything, for men. In the intense heat it may be tempting to lose layers – in respect of local customs, and to spare yourself unwanted harassment and disapproval, it is far wiser to cover up in cool, white flowing cottons, like the Pakistanis do, thus keeping the sun off too. Pakistan has borders to the north with Afghanistan, to the east with India and to the west with Iran; the Arabian Sea lies to the south. In the northeast is the disputed territory of Jammu and Kashmir, bounded by Afghanistan, China and India. The land covers a huge 796,096 sq km (305,058 sq miles) making it over three times the size of the UK. Pakistan comprises six distinct regions. There is the northern mountain area which has a high concentration of jaw-dropping peaks, and some of the largest glaciers outside of the polar regions - in fact five are over 45 km (28 miles) in length - as well as the Himalayan range which includes the fabled Nanga Parbat, which stands a whopping 8,125m (26,657ft) tall. The other regions are comprised by the northern plateau, which is effectively the lowlands at the bottom of the mountain ranges, the western mountains, the Balochistan plateau (which is hilly and very sparsely populated), the southeast desert which stretches into Rajasthan in India and the plain of the river Indus, which is within Sindh and the Punjab (‘Punjab’ literally means five waters, named after the Indus and it’s four tributaries).",['PK'],1,['PAK']
3888,"The Philippines is hot year-round but sea breezes can add freshness during the winter (November to February). The typhoon season lasts from around July to October, although in recent years it seems to have been starting and finishing later – in 2010 for example there was severe flooding in North Luzon as late as November. Rainfall patterns vary across the country. In Manila, Palawan and Coron, for example, most rain occurs in the typhoon season. Other areas (including much of the Bicol region) have no distinct dry season, with the most rain from December to February. The Visayas have only a short dry season from November to January, while in Leyte and Bohol, rainfall levels don’t change much throughout the year. Travellers should therefore check the local climate before making plans. Most tourists visit from January to May (and particularly the first half of that period) when most of the country is undergoing its best climatic conditions. Surfers, on the other hand, are attracted to the islands during the typhoon season as it brings the biggest waves. Lightweight cottons and linens are worn throughout most of the year, with warmer clothes useful on cooler evenings. Rainwear or umbrellas are advisable for the rainy season. The Philippines lie off the southeast coast of Asia between Taiwan and Borneo in the Pacific Ocean and South China Sea. They are composed of 7,107 islands and islets (7,108 at low tide), 2,773 of which are named.

3889,"Located just north of the equator, Singapore has a tropical climate and stays hot and humid throughout the year. Temperatures average around 31º C (88º F) during the day with little seasonal variation, although it’s slightly cooler in December and January, and hottest in April and May. Temperatures are unlikely to dip below 23º C (74º F) at night; the lowest temperature ever recorded was just over 19º C (66º F). Singapore receives a considerable amount of rainfall - approximately 2340mm annually. Although there are no distinct wet or dry seasons, the region is affected by two different monsoons. The Northeast Monsoon generally takes place from December to March and is accompanied by more frequent rain, particularly from November to January. Conversely, the Southwest Monsoon produces a marginally dryer climate from May to September. Despite the slightly lower overall precipitation levels, particularly from June to August, the Southwest Monsoon is characterized by its early-morning rainstorms; these often persist for one or two hours then taper off for the afternoon. Even these drier months experience a fair amount of rain (around 150mm each month), so be prepared for unpredictably wet weather any time of the year. The beginning and end of the two monsoon seasons are not well defined, but are separated by the shorter inter-monsoon periods of April/May and October/November, during which months afternoon and evening rain showers are likely. These showers are typically sudden and heavy, but often only last for a short time. The region is extremely humid, with humidity levels usually between 70% and 90%; often the air is muggiest in the early morning, abating somewhat in the afternoon. On rainy days it is not unreasonable to expect the humidity to reach 100%. When visiting, be sure to drink enough water and seek frequent refuge from the sticky heat indoors. March and September are particularly humid and often very uncomfortable. Thunderstorms are also a very regular phenomenon, occurring on roughly 40% of all days year-round but particularly common during the Southeast Monsoon. In fact, this small city-state has one of the highest rates of lightning activity worldwide. Despite the unpredictability of the weather, Singapore experiences as much brilliant sunshine as it does rain, and therefore makes for a delightful beach destination. If sunbathing happens to be interrupted by an unexpected shower, there is at least a plethora of indoor entertainment. As Singapore’s weather does not vary drastically throughout the year, tourism in the area is relatively steady year-round. The weather can be erratic and unpredictable, so it may be best to plan a visit based on the festival season rather than the climate; some of the nation’s most notable are the grand celebrations of Chinese New Year, the Lantern Festival and the Art Festival. Accommodation prices rise significantly during the Formula One racing. Be sure to pack lightweight cottons and linens to avoid becoming overheated in the muggy Singapore climate. Also remember to carry an umbrella any time of year, but particularly during the rainy season. The island of Singapore is situated off the southern extremity of the Malay Peninsula, separated from the mainland by the Johor Strait which is about 1km (0.8 miles) wide. Causeways run across the strait carrying roads, a railway and water pipes. The main island is mainly flat with only low hills, the highest being Bukit Timah at 166m (545ft). In the northeast of the island, and in the urban district, large areas have been reclaimed, and much of the original jungle and swamp covering the low-lying areas has been cleared. In addition to the main island, the Republic of Singapore includes more than 60 much smaller islands and islets.",['SG'],1,['SGP']

Generally speaking, the coastal areas of Sri Lanka enjoy temperatures averaging 28°C (82°F) while the upland areas are cooler and more temperate, with a yearly average around 16-20°C (60-68°F). The best time to visit Sri Lanka depends on where you go. The best time to visit the southwest region of Sri Lanka The best time to visit the southwest region of Sri Lanka is from December to April. During this time, the weather is warm; the city of Galle on the southwestern tip enjoys an average high of 29°C (84°F) for example. However, the Yala monsoon brings abundant rainfall to the southwest region from May to September, and to November in some coastal cities. The best time to visit the northeast region of Sri Lanka The best time to visit the northeast region of Sri Lanka is from May to September. The sun-drenched Trincomalee, a port city on the northeast coast of Sri Lanka, enjoys a balmy temperatures of 30°C (86°F) with little rain during this period. However, the Maha monsoon affects Sri Lanka’s northeast region from October to January. The best time to visit Colombo Sri Lanka’s largest city is hot, wet and humid year-round. The city receives abundant rainfall from April to May, then again from September to November. In terms of temperatures, Colombo enjoys an average high of 30°C (87°F) and an average low of 24°C (75°F) year round. The best time to visit Kandy and the central hill region Kandy is a major tourist destination in the Central Province, a mountainous area of Sri Lanka. Sitting at an elevation of 500m (1,600ft), Kandy is considerably cooler than the coastal regions of Sri Lanka with temperatures averaging between 23-26°C (73-79°F) year-round. Rainfall is expected throughout the year, but it tends to be heavy in October and November. The best time to visit Kandy is from January to March as the weather is mild and the rainfall is at its lowest. Please note that there is also an inter-monsoonal period in October and November during which rain and thunderstorms occur frequently across the island. So always pack an umbrella with you. The weather in Sri Lanka can be unpredictable during any season so depending on where in the country you're going, it's best to take layers. The central highlands can be significantly cooler throughout the year, so you'll need warmer clothes here. Lightweight rainwear is also recommended any time of year. Sri Lanka is an island off the southeast coast of the Indian state of Tamil Nadu. It is separated from India by the Indian Ocean, in which lies the chain of islands called Adam's Bridge. Sri Lanka has an irregular surface with low-lying coastal plains running inland from the northern and eastern shores. The central and southern areas slope into the hills and mountains ranges of the Central Highlands. The highest peak is Pidurutalagala, which reaches an altitude of 2,524m (8,281ft). The country’s coast consistx mainly of beaches and bays, with rocky cliffs in the northeast and southwest. Due to the southwestern location of the mountain range, precipitation is heavily weighted towards this area, with the the northern and eastern parts fall in the rain shadow of the Central Highlands. The wettest parts of the country in the south and west receive around 4,000mm of rainfall annually. There are two major national parks, in the northwest and southeast, designated as such to protect the immense biodiversity of the country’s wildlife.",['LK'],1,['LKA']
3892,"Despite the island’s relatively small size, the fact that Taiwan is bisected by the Tropic of Cancer means weather conditions can vary considerably from the north to the south. There’s a subtropical climate with moderate temperatures in the north, where rain is common in the winter months. The southern areas, where temperatures are higher on average, are less prone to rain. Summer can be uncomfortably hot across the island, making autumn and spring great times to come calling. The typhoon season usually comes into effect in late summer and makes itself felt most forcefully on the east coast, although in some years the phenomenon is far more active than in others. It might sound tempting to visit during the Chinese New Year celebrations, but while you’re likely to experience some spectacular revelry, you should be aware that accommodation prices always sky-rocket and many businesses and service providers shut down for the period. Light- to mediumweights, with rainwear advised. It’s a good idea not to wear overly skimpy clothing when visiting some of the stricter Buddhist temples, although light trousers and a t-shirt will always be considered perfectly acceptable for both sexes. It’s a wise idea to pack swimwear for the hot springs, although some single-sex bathing areas require no costume to be worn. Bring a pair of sturdy shoes too – even if you’re not intending to go trekking, there are some enjoyable short walks to be had at natural attractions like Taroko Gorge. Though Taiwanese territory includes dozens of small islands in the Taiwan Strait and the Pacific, the main island known as Taiwan covers the vast majority of the land area under Taiwanese administration. Almost two-thirds of Taiwan is covered by mountains, with 258 peaks over 3,000m (9,850ft), most of them heavily forested. The highest of these, Yushan (Jade Mountain), is northeast Asia's tallest mountain at 3,952m (13,042ft). This mountainous terrain is the result of the island’s location – it sits on the fault line of two tectonic plates, and was formed after a dramatic geological upheaval between four and five million years ago. It also sits on the Tropic of Cancer, putting it on the same line of latitude as Hawaii in the North Pacific. But while mountains dominate Taiwan's centre and rugged east coast, the island's western third is mostly alluvial plain and is host to most of the population. The two Pacific islands, Lyudao (Green Island) and Lanyu (Orchid Island), are popular holiday destinations, while the Taiwan Strait archipelagos of Penghu and Matzu hold historic and cultural appeal. And just a few kilometres off mainland China's Fujian coast, the tiny islands of Kinmen and Lieyu remain under Taiwanese control. The combination of climate, terrain and topography also makes the main island of Taiwan ripe for endemic flora and fauna, particularly in the diverse mountain forests. The Taiwan fir tree and Formosan black bear are two key examples. There’s also a rich bird life to enjoy, with various specialist tours available.",['TW'],1,['TWN']
3893,"In Dushanbe, temperatures vary between a minimum -13°C (8°F) in December/January to a maximum 33°C (91°F) in July/August. Humidity is generally low. In the mountains, it can reach -45°C (-49°F) when the wind chill factor is taken into consideration, and rise to 20°C (68°F) in summer. In the Pamir Mountains, the climate is semi-arid to polar. Warm clothing should be taken by anyone intending to visit themountains. Those intending to visit the southwest in summer shouldbring light, loose clothing. Tajikistan is bordered by Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan to the north, Afghanistan to the south and China (PR) to the east. 93% of the republic is occupied by mountains, most notably by the sparsely populated Pamir Mountains, which include Mount Garmo (formerly Pik Kommunizma; 7,495m/24,590ft), the highest point of the former Soviet Union. The mountainous terrain means that in winter it is impossible to reach the east or the north of the country by road without taking a detour through Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan. In the fertile plains of the southwest, cotton dominates the agriculture. In the north, in the Khudzand (formerly Leninabad) region, cotton and silk are the main crops.",['TJ'],1,['TJK']
3894,"Thailand has a tropical climate so it is generally very hot, particularly between March and May with April being the hottest month (30°C/86°F). The monsoon season runs from May/June to October, when the climate is still hot and humid with torrential rains. Rain in the south typically continues until December. The best time for travelling is November to March as the monsoon season is over and the hot temperatures of Thailand’s summer are yet to arrive. The southern islands like Koh Samui are best from June to September where temperatures average around 27/28°C (81/82°F). Lightweights and rainwear are advised. Informal dress is widely acceptable. Beachwear should be confined to the beach and topless sunbathing is frowned upon. Thailand is quite modest so short or revealing clothes in major cities should be avoided if the goal is to be respectful to the locals. Anything knee-length or longer is acceptable as well as shirts, polos and blouses. Take a pair of good walking shoes or boots for jungle trekking, and long-sleeved tops to protect against mosquitoes. Thailand is bordered to the west by Myanmar and the Indian Ocean, to the south and east by Malaysia and the Gulf of Thailand, to the east by Cambodia, and to the north and east by Laos. The Thai highlands dominate the north of Thailand and Isan in the northeast consists of the Khorat Plateau. The Chao Phraya River dominates central Thailand. Southern Thailand is part of the Malay Peninsula.",['TH'],1,['THA']
3895,"Turkmenistan has an extreme continental climate: temperatures in Ashgabat vary between 46°C (114°F) in summer and -5°C (23°F) in winter, although it has been known to reach -22°C (-8°F) in extremity. Temperatures in the desert in summer can reach 50°C (122°F) during the day before falling rapidly at night. During the winter, it can reach -10° to -15°C (14° to 15°F). For those intending to visit the desert in summer, lightweights arevital for the day with warmer clothing for those intending to spend thenight in the open. Heavyweights should be taken for winter visits. Turkmenistan shares borders with Kazakhstan to the north, Uzbekistan to the east, Afghanistan to the southeast and Iran to the south. To the west is the Caspian Sea. Nearly 80% of the country is taken up by the Kara-Kum (Black Sand) Desert, the largest in the CIS. The longest irrigation canal in the world stretches 1,100km (687 miles), from the Amu-Darya River in the east, through Ashgabat, before being piped the rest of the way to the Caspian Sea.",['TM'],1,['TKM']
3896,"Uzbekistan has an extreme continental climate. It is generally warmest in the south and coldest in the north. Temperatures in December average -8°C (18°F) in the north and 0°C (32°F) in the south. However, extreme fluctuations can take temperatures as low as -35°C (-31°F). During the summer months, temperatures can climb to 45°C (113°F) and above. Humidity is low. In recent years Uzbekistan has been notably affected by general global warming and the specific effects of the drying-out of the Aral Sea. This has turned snowy cold winters to mild ones with less precipitation. The best time to visit is during the spring and autumn, with September being the absolute optimum month. In the winter it can be bitterly cold so bring layers - mountain-wear works well. In the summer, it gets very hot so loose, breathable cottons are best. Covering approximately 448,000 sq km (173,000 square miles), Uzbekistan (literally ‘land of the Uzbeks’) is one of the larger countries in Central Asia (Kazakhstan is by far the largest) and the only one sharing borders with four other Central Asian states. Mountainous Kyrgyzstan lies to the northeast, Tajikistan to the south, Turkmenistan to the southwest, and Kazakhstan to the north with which it shares a suitably long border at 2,203km (1,370 miles). There is also a very short 137km (85 miles) border with war-torn Afghanistan. To the north, and in the central part of the country, lies one of the largest deserts in the world – Kyzyl Kum (meaning ‘red sand’ in Turkic), where the odd camel grazes and where gold is mined in the centre. Elsewhere, the terrain of Uzbekistan is mostly flat. Desert dunes cover the country and some river valleys flow along the courses of the Amu Darya, Syr Darya (Sirdaryo), and Zarafshon rivers. Steppe land and desert plains account for two-thirds of the land mass, with the remainder of the land rising into the foothills of the Tien Shan mountain range. The peaks along the border of Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan reach to over 4,000m (13,000ft). While less than 10% of the land is arable, there are plenty of minerals, containing stocks of natural gas, lignite and coal, gold (it is the world’s ninth largest producer) and copper.",['UZ'],1,['UZB']
3897,"Because of its geography, the climate in Vietnam varies greatly from north to south with three distinct climatic zones. Tropical monsoons occur from October to April in the centre and from May to September in the north and south. It is almost totally dry throughout the rest of the year. It can get exceptionally hot, however, all year round, but the north has a cooler time between October and April. Temperatures around the country can reach up to 40C in the height of the hot and rainy season (May to September), but the northern highlands and Hanoi can often seem chilly and damp in the winter. There is no one ideal time to visit Vietnam as a whole but at any time of year there will be sun somewhere. The high season is from September to March but bad weather can disrupt travel in the centre of the country during this period, particularly from September to December. For the beaches in the centre of Vietnam, Danang, Hoi An and Nha Trang, it is best to go between May and August. The autumn is the best time to visit Halong Bay when there should be clear skies. Loose, natural fabrics all year, but warmer clothing is required in the highlands, and in the winter in north Vietnam. Rainwear is essential during the wet season. Vietnam lies within the tropics and is principally agricultural with a central tropical rainforest. The 'S'-shaped country shares borders to the north with the People's Republic of China and to the west with Laos and Cambodia. The eastern and southern shores are lapped by the South China Sea and the Pacific Ocean. Northern Vietnam is dominated by the Red River plains that bisect Hanoi, and the Lo and Chay rivers. To the north and west of Hanoi are green hilly areas; particularly well known is the Sapa Valley. East of Hanoi, Halong Bay features a stunning natural formation of more than 3,000 limestone islands jutting sharply out of the South China Sea. To the south, it is the Mekong River and its fertile plain that governs the geography and consequently the rice industry. Among the plains, in the middle of the thin country and to the southwest are mountainous areas, known as the highlands, where farmers grow rubber, tea and coffee.",['VN'],1,['VNM']
3898,"Hot throughout the year, tempered by trade winds in local areas, particularly early in the year. The average rainfall for the year is 89 cm (35in) and the hurricane season is from July to November. Lightweight cottons throughout the year. Waterproofs are advisable for the rainy season. Anguilla, the northernmost of the Leeward Islands, also comprises the island of Sombrero, lying 48km (30 miles) north of Anguilla, and several small islets or cays. The nearest islands are St Maarten, 8km (5 miles) south of Anguilla, and St Kitts and Nevis, 113km (70 miles) to the southeast. The islands are mainly flat (the highest point, Crocus Hill, is only 60m (213ft) above sea level) with, arguably, some of the best beaches in the world.",['AI'],1,['AIA']
3899,"The islands enjoy a very pleasant balmy tropical climate which remains warm and relatively dry throughout the year, with relatively little variance. Temperatures range from lows of 22°C (72°F) to highs of 40°C (104°F) all year round, with October to January being the hottest time of year, staying in the region of 30°C (86°F) to 35°C (95°F). Cooling winds blow in from the south east so the heat rarely feels too unbearable. In general, humidity in Antigua and Barbuda is quite low, meaning you won't be drenched in a sweaty fug during your trip. The rainy season runs from around June to November, and during this time daily rain showers are common; there is also a good chance of tropical storms and hurricanes across the islands. Their location in the hurricane zone means the islands are vulnerable to powerful storms every two or three years, whilst hurricanes can hit every two to six years. Dress for a tropical climate - lightweight cottons or linens will be appropriate for most of the year, but those visiting the islands from June to September should bring waterproofs so that they're not caught out when the rains come. Antigua & Barbuda is made up of three islands; Antigua, Barbuda and Redonda. Low-lying and volcanic in origin, they are part of the Leeward Islands group in the northeast Caribbean. Antigua's coastline curves into a multitude of coves and harbours (they were once volcanic craters) and there are more than 365 beaches of fine white sand, fringed with palms. The island's highest point, Mount Obama stands at 402m (1,319ft) high, and its capital is St John's. Barbuda lies 61.5km (38.2 miles) north of Antigua and is an unspoiled natural haven for wild deer and exotic birds. Its 8km-long (5 miles) beach is reputed to be among the most beautiful in the world. The island's village capital, Codrington, was named after the Gloucestershire family that once leased Barbuda from the British Crown for the price of 'one fat pig per year if asked for'. There are excellent beaches and the ruins of some of the earliest plantations in the West Indies. The coastal waters are rich with all types of crustaceans and tropical fish. Redonda, the smallest in the group, is little more than an uninhabited rocky islet. It lies 40km (25 miles) southwest of Antigua.",['AG'],1,['ATG']
3900,"With an average temperature of 28°C (82°F), this dry and sunny island is made pleasantly cool throughout the year by constant trade winds. Short showers occur during the months of October, November and December. Lightweight clothes. Sweaters are useful for air conditioned hotels and restaurants. Some upscale restaurants do not allow shorts and T-shirts. Aruba is the smallest island in the Leeward group of the Dutch Caribbean islands, which also include Bonaire and Curaçao; they are popularly known as the ABCs. As the westernmost island of the group, Aruba is the final link in the long Antillean chain, lying 20km (12.5 miles) off the Venezuelan coast. The island is 30km (19.6 miles) long and 9km (6 miles) across at its widest, and has a flat landscape dominated by Jamanota Mountain (188m/617ft). The west and southwest coast, known as Palm Beach, boasts 11km (7 miles) of palm-fringed powder-white sands while, in contrast, the east coast has a desolate and windswept shoreline of jagged rocks carved into peculiar shapes by the pounding surf.",['AW'],1,['ABW']

During the so-called wet season (July to November), some brief rain showers are likely. Average sunshine hours per day are eight to 10 from November to March and eight to nine from April to October. Tropical storms and hurricanes may occur between June and November. Lightweight cottons are advised; beachwear is not worn in towns. As the most easterly of the Caribbean chain, Barbados lies well to the east of the West Indies. A lively surf scene enjoys pounding waves along the rugged east coast where a rocky shoreline kicks up plenty of spray. To the west, fine white sand beaches and natural coral reefs predominate. A handful of gently rolling hills form a ripple to the north while the rest of the island is predominantly flat. Coral filters ensure surrounding waters are among the purest on the planet.",['BB'],1,['BRB']
3903,"Sub-tropical, with no wet season. The Gulf Stream, which flows between Bermuda and the North American continent, keeps the climate temperate. Change of seasons comes during mid November to mid December and from late March through to April, when spring or summer weather may occur and visitors should be prepared for both. Showers may be heavy at times but the skies usually clear quickly. Summer temperatures prevail from May to mid October, with the warmest weather from July to September - this period is occasionally followed by high winds. Visitors should note that such high winds between 1 June and 30 November can (albeit rarely) turn into hurricanes and tropical storms. Since Bermuda is a small target, most storms brush by and only bring elevated surf. Lightweight cottons and linens. Light waterproofs or umbrellas are advisable and warmer clothes for cooler months. Bermuda consists of a chain of some 180 coral islands and islets lying 1,046km (650 miles) off the coast of Cape Hatteras. The seven largest of the islands are linked by bridges and one causeway to form the principal mainland. There are no rivers or streams and the islands are entirely dependent on rainfall for fresh water.",['BM'],1,['BMU']

Bonaire offers good conditions for diving all year round, althought conditions at the south end are generally at their calmest February-April. Lightweights with warmer top layers for evenings; showerproof clothing is advisable throughout the year. Bonaire is the second-largest island in the former Netherlands Antilles and is located 80km (50 miles) north of Venezuela and 48km (30 miles) east of Curaçao. The landscape is flat and rocky and, owing to low annual rainfall, Bonaire has a fairly barren desert climate. The island has small, beautiful beaches and safe waters.",['BQ'],1,['BES']

Night-time temperatures drop to a comfortable level. Visitors should note that the British Virgin Islands are susceptible to hurricanes and earthquakes, although these are by no means a frequent occurrence. The primary hurricane season is from June to November. Tropical lightweights. Dress is generally informal but swimwear is confined to beaches. The 50-plus islands, rocks and cays of the British Virgin Islands, only 16 of which are inhabited, make up the larger part of an archipelago forming the northern extremity of the Leeward Islands in the eastern Caribbean. They are situated approximately 100km (62 miles) east of Puerto Rico, adjoining the US Virgin Islands. The islands are volcanic in origin, with the exception of Anegada, which is formed of coral and limestone and is the lowest lying. The topography is otherwise mountainous, the highest point being Tortola's Sage Mountain, which rises to 550m (1,800ft). There are remnants of a primeval rainforest on Tortola.",['VG'],1,['VGB']
3906,"The Cayman Islands enjoy a very warm, tropical climate throughout the year, with temperatures that can reach highs of up 33°C (91°F) during the summer, moderated by trade winds. The best time to visit is during the dry months of December to April, when temperatures are generally cooler than in summer, hovering between 22°C (72°F) and 27°C (80°F). The rainy season is from May to October but showers are generally short and sharp (ie lasting hours rather than days); these can provide temporary respite from the hot summer sun. July and August are the hottest months, whilst the hurricane season is from June to November. Since the islands are low-lying, there is a high risk of flooding if a storm hits. During the dry season, wear lightweight, natural fabrics; temperatures rarely dip below 21°C (70°F), so you shouldn't need anything much heavier than this. A good strategy is to take layers, so that you can be ready for cooler conditions should the trade winds blow strongly. During the rainy season, bring a light raincoat or umbrella. Warmer clothes may be needed on cooler evenings. The Cayman Islands are situated in the Caribbean, around 440km (270 miles) northwest of Jamaica, 390km (240 miles) south of Cuba and 640km (400 miles) south of Miami. At around 197 sq km (76 sq miles) Grand Cayman is the largest and most populous island in this British overseas territory. Little Cayman and Cayman Brac lie around 130km (80 miles) northeast of Grand Cayman and are separated from each other by a channel about 16km (10 miles) wide. The islands are peaks of a very deep subterranean mountain range called Cayman Ridge, which extends from Cuba towards the Gulf of Honduras. All three islands are situated in some of the deepest waters in the Caribbean; the Cayman Trough which separates them from Jamaica reaches a depth of 6.4km (4 miles). The islands themselves are relatively low-lying, with the highest point on Grand Cayman reaching only 18m (60ft) above sea level. The Bluff, a magnificent limestone peak on Cayman Brac is the highest point on all three islands, reaching an elevation of 43m (140ft). The beaches on the Cayman Islands are considered some of the very best in the Caribbean, the most notable one being Seven Mile Beach on Grand Cayman. Casuarinas and sea-grape trees line many of the beaches, many of which are protected offshore by a fringing reef.",['KY'],1,['CYM']
3907,"Cuba has a tropical climate with two main seasons: the dry season starts in late November and lasts until mid-April, and the rainy season is from May to October. The dry season (late November to mid-April) is the best time to visit Cuba, and you can expect daytime temperatures to be around 26°C (79°F) to 30°C (86°F). It must be noted that rainfall does occur during the dry season – the sky will open up and rain hard for a few days a month. The rainy season (May to October) is wet and muggy. From August to October, tropical storms and cyclones are likely to affect the eastern part of Cuba. Hurricanes can happen during this period too. Shaped like a crocodile, Cuba is long and slender in size. The climate varies slightly from one side to the other. Generally, the northwestern part of Cuba (where Havana is located) is a few degrees cooler than the southeastern part from December to March, when the cool air from North America arrives. The best time to visit Havana: The best time to visit Havana is from December to March when the rainfall is at its lowest – February and March are the driest months with just 45mm (1.8 inches) of rain each month. But when it rains, expect a heavy downpour. Temperature-wise, you can expect average highs to be between 26°C (79°F) to 28°C (82°F) during this period. If you are visiting Havana from June to October, rain gear is a must. The best time to visit Santiago de Cuba: The second-largest city, Santiago de Cuba sits on the southern coast and enjoys slightly warmer weather than Havana. The best time to visit Santiago de Cuba is still from December to March, during the dry season, and you can expect an average high of 28°C (82°F). Rainfalls are frequent from May to October (except July). Cuba's tropical climate means lightweight cotton clothing is recommended year-round. Long-sleeves are ideal as they can protect you from mosquitoes bites. A light sweater is advisable for cooler evenings. Light waterproofs are useful during the dry season (late November to mid-April), while proper rain gear is essential during the rainy season (May to October). Cuba is the largest Caribbean island, about the size of England, and the most westerly of the Greater Antilles group, lying a mere 145km (90 miles) south of Florida. The country also includes about 1,600 other much smaller islands, islets and cays. The terrain of Cuba is mostly flat, but one-third of the country is mountainous, and the three most important mountain ranges are the Sierra de Los Órganos in the western region, the Sierra del Escambray in the central region, and the Sierra Maestra in the Eastern region.

In Santo Domingo, the temperatures are constant throughout the year, ranging between 25°C (77°F) and 28°C (82°F) while rain falls abundantly from May to November. The resort town Punta Cana on the east coast is extremely popular with European and American tourists from December to March who seek to escape the cold in the northern hemisphere. In January, the average high in Punta Cana is 29°C (84°F) while the average low is 21°C (70°F). Precipitation is high from June to November, with a risk of hurricanes too. April is the shoulder season, meaning good weather (27°C/81°F) and fewer crowds. If you're visiting the mountainous interior, it's best to pack a light sweater as it can get very cold at high elevations. Lightweight fabrics are best suited to the tropical temperatures. Waterproofs are essential during the rainy seasons. The Dominican Republic shares the Caribbean island of Hispaniola with the nation of Haiti. It is larger than its French-speaking neighbour, occupying two-thirds of the landmass. A series of mountain belts stretch across the border region, most notably in the form of the Cordillera Central; at 3,175m (10,414ft) the peak of Pico Duarte represents the highest point of the country. The Dominican landscape is frequently forested and often undulating, with a multitude of valleys, plains and plateaux. The soil is fertile with excellent white beaches on the north, southeast and east coasts. Ten per cent of the country was set aside in the 1970s to be protected as national parks and science reserves, and, in spite of occasional hurricanes and fires, these areas remain largely intact. Today there are 17 national parks in the Dominican Republic. Capital city Santo Domingo sits on the south coast (providing a popular stop-off for cruise ships), while the country's second largest city, Santiago, is located in the central northwest region. The Reserva Cientifica Banco de Plata is an underwater park located off the north coast, set up to preserve a breeding ground for the thousands of humpback whales that visit each winter.",['DO'],1,['DOM']

Peak season runs roughly from mid-December to mid-April when crowds swell and prices rise. The wettest months are May and October, but showers may occur at any time. Between June and November, Jamaica is prone to hurricanes. It also lies within the earthquake zone. The annual rainfall averages 1980mm, but nationwide there are some considerable variations, with the east coast receiving considerably more rain than elsewhere on the island. Parts of the Blue Mountains receive an average of 7620mm a year. By contrast, the south coast sees little rain and in places is semi-barren. Jamaica is a year-round destination, though there are seasonal differences to consider. Weather-wise, temperature isn’t an important factor: winter is usually warm by day and mild to cool by night, and summer months are simply hot. Pack lightweight cottons and casual linens. Light woollens are advised for evenings when mosquitoes can make long sleeves more appealing than skimpy beachwear. Sunhats and waterproofs are handy all year round. With an area of 10,992 sq km (4,244 sq miles), Jamaica is the largest island of the Commonwealth Caribbean and the third largest of the Greater Antilles, after Cuba and Hispaniola. A largely mountainous terrain reaches 2,256m (7,402ft) at the Blue Mountain Peak in the east, descending westward in a series of ridges and forested ravines. Over 1,000km (621 miles) of coastline offers fine beaches in the north and west. At its greatest extent, Jamaica is 235km (146 miles) long with a width that varies between 35 and 82km (22 and 51 miles). The island is a quarter the size of Estonia, half the size of the Scottish Highlands, roughly the same size of the American state of Connecticut.",['JM'],1,['JAM']
3916,"Warm weather throughout the year, with the main rainy season occurring in the autumn. Showers can occur at other times of the year, but they are usually brief. Cooler in the upland areas. Lightweight, with waterproof wear advised for the rainy season. The French Overseas Department of Martinique, a volcanic and picturesque island, is the northernmost of the Windward Caribbean group. The island is noticeably more rocky than those of the Leeward group, with beaches (of fine black or white or peppered sand) surrounded by sugar, palm, banana and pineapple plantations.",['MQ'],1,['MTQ']
3917,"The climate is subtropical, tempered by trade winds. There is little climatic variation throughout the year making Montserrat a great year round destination. The heaviest rainfall occurs between July and November; however, the heavy cloudbursts serve to refresh the atmosphere and once they are over the sun reappears. Tropical lightweights are worn, with light woollens for cooler evenings. A light raincoat or an umbrella is useful. Montserrat is one of the Leeward Islands group in the Eastern Caribbean. It is a volcanic island with black sandy beaches and lush tropical vegetation. There are three main volcanic mountains on the island and Chances Peak is its highest point at 915m (3,002ft). The Soufrière group of hills houses the volcano which began erupting in July 1995 and to date is continuously active. The Great Alps Waterfall, previously one of the most spectacular sights in the West Indies, has been destroyed by the volcano.",['MS'],1,['MSR']
3918,"Unlike many islands in the Caribbean, any time is really the best time to visit Puerto Rico and enjoy its tropical climate. The rainy season is from April to November, but precipitation patterns and amounts vary considerably from one part of the island to the other. Even in the rainiest areas, showers are likely to be intense but brief. If you're travelling from San Juan to Ponce (or vice-versa), you'll notice an immediate difference once you reach the top of the mountain about halfway through your journey. The south tends to be drier than the north. In the mountainous region, you'll want a light jacket or sweater, as the higher elevation means cooler temperatures. 1 June to 30 November is hurricane season, though Puerto Rico is rarely affected by hurricanes. February is an excellent time to visit Puerto Rico; when temperatures are typically cold on the mainland USA, they're usually neither too hot nor too cool in la isla del encanto, the island of enchantment. Lightweight tropical clothes. Light rainwear required. Dress clothes for finer dining and nightclub visits. Bathing suits, of course, are de rigeur for those who plan to enjoy the water! A hat and sunglasses will help protect you from the sun's searing rays, and if you plan to snorkel or spend lots of time in the water, a long-sleeved shirt that repels UV rays is highly recommended. Puerto Rico is an island east of the Dominican Republic and west of the British Virgin Islands. The rougher, cooler Atlantic Ocean is on the north side of the island; the calmer, warmer Caribbean Sea is on the south side. It is the smallest island in the Greater Antilles and the largest island in the Lesser Antilles. Culebra, Mona and Vieques are among several smaller islands that are part of Puerto Rican territory. The waters surrounding the island are quite deep; the Puerto Rico trench is the deepest part of the Atlantic Ocean. The island is comparatively small, 8,959 sq km (3,459 sq miles), with a central mountain range reaching an altitude of 1,338m (4,390ft) at Cerro de Punta, and surrounded by low coastal plains. The island has remarkable geographic diversity for its size, with limestone formations in the interior, a desert in the southeastern part of the island, and the rainforest. Mangroves dominate the southern shore and are an important part of the island's ecosystem. San Juan, the capital, is on the northeast shore. Much of the island's natural forest has been cleared for agriculture, but the trees in the northeast corridor are protected as a national park. One of the hot-button environmental and political issues on the island is increasing development, particularly by the tourism industry with respect to hotel and resort construction. The island's nature conservancy, the Fideicomiso, has played a critical role in acquiring and protecting significant land and restoring properties for public visits and educational purposes. The other main towns are Aguadilla, Arecibo, Bayamón, Caguas, Carolina, Cayey, Fajardo, Guaynabo, Mayagüez and Ponce.",['PR'],1,['PRI']

3932,"Belarus enjoys a seasonal, continental climate with long, cold winters and warm, temperate summers. It experiences huge temperature fluctuations throughout the year, with the extremes of each season ensuring that Belarus isn't a typical year-round destination for tourists. The best time to visit is during the warmer months from May to September when the days are longest and the weather is mild. In July and August temperatures can reach highs of 25°C (77°F) although the average is 18°C (64°F). Summer is the perfect time to enjoy the Belarusian countryside and forage in the forests for wild berries. Winter starts in December and finishes in February, with temperatures hitting lows of -4°C (24.8°F) on average. In Eastern parts of the country the snow lasts around a month longer, so winter often lasting four months rather than the usual three. Once spring arrives and the 'thaw' begins, temperatures increase rapidly, and while it's uncommon, April can creep into the mid 20's°C (70's°F), so travelling in spring is also a viable option for tourists looking to save some money and enjoy Belarus at an off-peak time of year. Rain is also common in Belarus, with between 5 and 7 days of precipitation on average per month – the volume of this can fluctuate, with Belarus receiving 600-700mm of rainfall annually. Minsk, the capital, is situated in the heart of Belarus and experiences both the heat of summer and the cold of winter. July and August are peak season for Minsk in terms of weather, with average temperatures of 26°C (79°F) throughout the days in August and lows of 15°C (60°F) during August nights. The humidity level in summer is much higher in Minsk, so the chance of precipitation is also increased. Brest is centrally located and experiences similar weather to Minsk. With the August average reaching a balmy 27°C (81°F) in the day and 15°C (60°F) at night, the climate is comparable to the capital if not slightly warmer. Brest is more humid than its Eastern counterpart however, and rain is more likely. The peak time to visit Brest is in the heart of summer during July, so bear this in mind when arranging travel. In the winter you'll need to account for cold temperatures, so wearing medium to heavyweight clothing is advisable. Jeans, knits and heavy coats, as well as good boots are a minimum requirement. In the summer, depending on whereabouts you’re visiting, thinner cottons, linens, shorts and t-shirts will be fine. Waterproofs are advisable throughout the year due to the prevalence of rain. Bordered by Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Ukraine and the Russian Federation, Belarus is a landlocked, relatively flat country, crisscrossed by thousands of streams and major rivers such as the Dnieper. Its landscape is characterised by rich forests, which make up approximately 40% of the country, as well as uplands and lowlands created by glacial movements during the last Ice Age. These are responsible for the Belarusian ridge, which runs diagonally across the country from its mid-west to north-east. Straddling the border between Belarus and Poland is Białowieża Forest, one of the last stretches of Europe's primeval forests and home to approximately 800 bison. The Palyessye plain, a swampy lowland in the southwest of Belarus was severely affected by the Chernobyl disaster and much of the area is off-limits as it is now part of the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone.",['BY'],1,['BLR']

Belgium is situated in northwestern Europe, bordered by France to the south, Germany to the east,Luxembourg to the southeast and the Netherlands to the north. There is 60km (37 miles) of North Sea coastline to the northwest. The country is divided into three regions: southern French-speaking Wallonia, northern Dutch-speaking Flanders and Brussels nestled between the two. Both Flanders and Wallonia are then subdivided into ten provinces: within Flanders they are West Flanders, East Flanders, Flemish Brabant, Antwerp and Limburg; within Wallonia they are Hainaut, Walloon Brabant, Namur, Liège and Luxembourg (not to be confused with the neighbouring country of Luxembourg). Flanders’ landscape is characterised by low-lying polders near the coast, changing to rolling hills and fertile farming grounds in the Flemish Brabant and finishing with the wooded Hoge Kempen − Flanders’ only national park − in the east. Flowing across this landscape is the country’s largest river the Scheldt, which enters Belgium near Tournai and flows out to sea at Antwerp. In contrast, landlocked Wallonia is dominated by intensive farming in its northern provinces, watered by the Sambre and Meuse rivers, with the terrain rising to form the hills and gorges of the Ardennes in the south.

Summer (June to August) is dry with plenty of sunshine and average highs reaching 30°C (86°F). This is the best time to visit Cyprus for those who like the heat, although the intense sun can make sightseeing a challenge. The heat is tempered by sea breezes in coastal areas. Drinking lots of water is essential to avoiding dehydration. Autumn (September to November) starts off warm and dry, but by November, average high drops to 22°C (72°F) and rain-bearing winds start to hit the country. Winter (December to February) is mild with often heavy, although sporadic, tropical-style rainstorms. Villages located on higher ground are sometimes subjected to freezing temperatures and frost, while heavy snowfall is experienced in the interior Troodos Mountains and usually stays for several weeks, providing decent ski conditions. Pack lightweight, cotton clothing for the summer months, such as loose tops, shorts and linen trousers, along with a hat to protect against the sun. Warmer medium-weight clothing is ideal for spring, autumn and sunny winter days, together with cardigans or jackets for evenings, which can get very cold. Rainwear should be packed for winter visits.

Winter can see temperatures drop to low minus numbers, whilst the summer period from May to August can see them soar above 30ºC (86ºF). Rather inconveniently, summer also sees the highest rainfall across the country. Shoulder seasons, such as the months of September and October, will still be hot, but are also likely to be drier than preceding months, so it may be preferable to travel during this time. Depending on where in the country you’re travelling, the climate may differ considerably. In the mountains, the weather tends to be cooler, experiencing higher levels of precipitation at higher altitudes. No special clothes are required for the Czech Republic. Wear mediumweights, such as denim and heavy wools, a topcoat and sturdy shoes for winter. Lightweights such as cottons, linens and thin wools will be suitable for summer, but remember to bring waterproofs as rain showers are more frequent during this time. The Czech Republic is a landlocked country situated in central Europe, sharing frontiers with Germany in the west, Poland in the north, the Slovak Republic in the east, and Austria in the south. Covering only about one-third of the area of the United Kingdom, the country is hilly and picturesque. The western two-thirds of the country is known as Bohemia, and consists of a vast river basin fringed by hills and mountains. The Czech Republic's longest river, the Labe, rises in the Krkonoše Mountains in the northeast, on the border with Poland, and flows south, then west, then north into Germany where it becomes the River Elbe. These mountains are also home to the country's highest summit, Sněžka which stand 1,602m (5,262ft) tall. Prague sits almost in the middle of Bohemia on the River Vltava, which flows into the Labe just to the north of the city. The Vltava rises in the forested Šumava hills that run along the country's southern border with Austria. The plains to the north of Prague are bordered by the Krušné Hory (Ore Mountains, named for the iron ore and other minerals found there). The eastern third of the Czech Republic is known as Moravia. This region is also based on a river basin, that of the Morava River, which rises in the northern hills near the Polish border and flows south to join the Danube at Bratislava. The main city of Moravia is Brno, the second-largest in the Czech Republic.",['CZ'],1,['CZE']
3940,"Denmark has a temperate climate marked by relatively cool summers and moderately cold winters. In terms of precipitation, it has about 765mm (30 inches) a year. Spring (March to May) starts of cold but warms up gradually. This is usually the driest season. Summer (June to August) is the best season to visit as the weather is pleasant with long daylight – about 17 hours of daylight per day in June and July – thanks to its northerly latitude. In July, the average high in Copenhagen is 21°C (70°F) but temperatures are lower for cities in the north bordering the North Sea. Climate change is affecting every country including Denmark, so from time to time there are hot days which see temperatures climbing to 30°C (75°F) and beyond. Autumn (September to November) is often windy and rainy; pack a raincoat if you plan to visit during these months. Winter (December to February) is cold and the days are short (the sun sets between 3.30pm to 4.30pm in December). In January, the average high is 2°C (36°F) while the average low is -2°C (28°F) in Copenhagen, but in January 1987, the city saw the temperature drop to -18°C (-0.5°F). Weather in the Faroe Islands: The Faroe Islands are under the influence of the warm current of the Gulf Stream, as such they enjoy a very mild climate despite its latitude. Winters are mild, but the islands are often cloudy, windy and cool throughout the year. Summers are cool, but with long hours of daylight. Weather in Greenland: Greenland has an Arctic climate, with low humidity making temperatures feel warmer than expected. However, average temperatures in summer seldom exceed 10°C (50°F). You can also follow the link and see the weather in Copenhagen and the best time to visit Copenhagen guide for more information. As Denmark borders the North Sea and the Baltic Sea, it means the weather often changes, so pack a jacket and a raincoat if you're visiting in summer. Waterproof gear and extra layers are a must in autumn. Heavyweight for winter months and mediumweight is suitable for spring. Located south of Norway and southwest of Sweden, Denmark is the smallest Scandinavian country. The country consists of the peninsula of Jutland (which is north of Germany) and over 400 islands of various sizes, some inhabited and linked to the mainland by ferry or bridge. The landscape consists mainly of low-lying, fertile countryside broken by beech woods, small lakes and fjords. Greenland and the Faroe Islands are also under the sovereignty of the Kingdom of Denmark, although both have home rule. The Faroe Islands is a group of 18 major islands in the North Atlantic inhabited by a population of 51,540 (2019), whose history dates back to the Viking period. Greenland is located between the Arctic and Atlantic oceans and the largest non-continental island in the world. Three quarters of Greenland is covered by a permanent ice sheet and its population of 55,877 (estimate 2018) makes it the least densely populated territory in the world.",['DK'],1,['DNK']
3941,"The weather in England is temperate with mild summers and winters, influenced by the Atlantic Ocean and the warm Gulf Stream. Rainfall is fairly evenly spread throughout the year, though the west is wetter than the east. Contrary to the stereotype, most cities across England actually have less average precipitation than other European cities. England is a population destination year-round with many attractions and activities to occupy you whatever the season, although spring (March to May) and autumn (September to November) are widely considered to be the best time to visit England due to the mild weather and sunny days. Summer (June to August) in England is lovely but can crowded, particularly in popular holidaying spots such as Brighton, Devon and Cornwall. Winter (December to February) tends to be grey and wet. Snow is rare, which is why a cold snap with a small amount of snow can cause problems with transport and infrastructure. As most cities decked out in exuberant lights leading up to Christmas, December is a good month to visit too. London is the capital and the largest city in England. Located in south England, London has a temperate oceanic climate and is one of the warmest places in the UK due to the heat stored in buildings and pavement. Greenwich, an area within London, enjoys an average high of 8°C (46°F) in January and 23°C (74°F) in July. It also receives an average precipitation of 557 mm (22 in) a year. In comparison, the average precipitation received by Amsterdam and Paris is 805mm (32 in) and 641mm (25 in) respectively. For more information, see this Weather in London and the best time to visit guide. Manchester, located about 260km (160 miles) northwest of London, is a few degrees cooler than London. In July, the average high is 21°C (70°F) while the average low is 14°C (57°F). The weather in England is mild and temperatures do cool down considerably in the evenings, so a light jacket is always useful. Thunderstorm doesn't happen often, though it may drizzle on and off, so a rain jacket and appropriate footwear are useful too. During summer, shorts, sandals and t-shirts are fine, but bring extra layers as weather can be changeable. Do layer up if you are travelling beyond London, particularly to the north as it is always a few degrees cooler than London. Mainland England makes up almost half of the British Isles. There are also several small islands including the Isle of Wight and the Isles of Scilly both of which lie off the south coast. In the south, much of the landscape is made up of undulating green hills given over to agriculture, with the South Downs and Cotswolds being prime examples of this. The east and north of England is flat and low lying – most notably in the east are the Fens, flat marshland that surrounds the East Anglian towns of Cambridge and Peterborough. The coastline is endlessly varied, with northern England's coast made up mainly of flat sand dunes, whereas the south is notable for the Jurassic Coast of Dorset, a World Heritage site where the cliffs span 153km (95 miles) and 185 million years of history, and numerous fossil discoveries have been made. Further north, the landscape becomes more dramatic. The mountain ranges of the Yorkshire Dales and Lake District in the northwest afford picturesque views of valleys, lakes, forest and mountains, making both destinations popular with hikers. The Pennine mountain range (also known as the 'backbone of England') bisects the northern region, creating a natural divide between the North West and North East. Traversed by the Pennine Way, the UK's longest footpath, hikers can get up close to one of the most scenic in England and take in one of the most scenic parts of England.",['GB'],1,['GBR']
3942,"Located in the northern part of the temperate climate zone and influenced by the Atlantic Ocean and Baltic Sea, Estonia has four distinct seasons with July being the warmest month and February the coldest. Rainfall is moderately low throughout the year, but falling frequently in summer and autumn. Spring (March to May) sees water levels rise due to snow melts, flooding low-lying lands and giving keen canoers access to places that are otherwise accessible by foot. In Tallinn, the average temperatures rise gradually from -1°C (30°F) in March to 11°C (52°F) in May. Summer (June to August) is the best time to visit Estonia as visitors can enjoy warm days and a string of festivals. However, do bring a raincoat as summer can be wet with frequent showers. In some coastal areas, visitors get to enjoy 19 hours of daylight in June. Autumn (September to November) sees many gloomy days and frequent rainfall. September is still a good time to visit Estonia but by November, the weather turns cold and wet with temperatures averaging just 1°C (34°F). Winter (December to February) is cold and snowy, particularly in the southwest where the warm sea current does not quite reach. Despite cold, Tallinn is most atmospheric with the Christmas Market sparkles in the charming Old Town. Lighter clothes are worn during the summer months, although a jacket is advisable in the evening. Wrap up warm if you're visiting during the winter months. Check the climate of the specific area you intend to travel to as winter temperatures vary greatly between the coast and inland. Estonia is the most northerly of the three Baltic Republics and is bordered to the north and west by the Baltic Sea, to the east by the Russian Federation and to the south by Latvia. The country is one of great scenic beauty with many forests, more than 1,400 lakes and 1,500 islands. Smaller than Lithuania and Latvia, it has nevertheless the longest coastline of all the Baltic States.",['EE'],1,['EST']
3943,"The climate of Finland varies greatly depending on the latitude; the relatively temperate climate of the south coast is quite different from the challenging winters in Lapland. Summer is Jun-Aug, winter is Nov-Mar, but snow in Lapland can start around October and linger until May. July temperatures average 21°C (70°F) in the capital Helsinki and 20°C (68°F) in Rovaniemi. 86. In the far south there is no midnight sun, but around 19 hours of daylight in the summer. In Lapland you can expect midnight sun for up to 2 months. January temperatures average -7°C (20°F) in Helsinki and -15°C (5°F) in Rovaniemi. Keep in mind that the record low temperatures range from -35°C to -45°C (-31°F to -40°F) regardless of region, and recent years have seen particularly cold winters. Around midwinter the sun will not rise in Lapland, perfect for spotting the northern lights. Further south there will be about 6 hours of daylight during the winter months. Rainfall is distributed fairly evenly throughout the year in the south, with an average of around 18 days of rainfall in Helsinki per month. The north may be drier, but also particularly plagued by gnats and mosquitoes. In summer, travellers can get away with lightweight clothing in the daytime, but long sleeves and long trousers or skirts may be more comfortable for the evening. Waterproof clothes are useful throughout the year. If you are hiking through forests, wear waterproof boots, long sleeves and trousers to protect against mosquitoes and ticks. In Lapland you will need insect repellent. In winter, bring appropriate clothing for snowy conditions, including wool under-layers and socks (not cotton) as well as snow boots with a good grip. In the Arctic North, you may need expedition-quality winter clothing. Towns and resorts generally offer these for hire and hotel staff can give recommendations on what you will need. With Sweden to the west, and Russia to the east, the history and politics of Finland have been shaped by its location. The national character of the Finns has been further coloured by the water-logged landscape - the country is hemmed in by the Gulf of Bothnia and the Gulf of Finland and 10% of its landmass lies underwater. Finland has over 179,000 islands, including the 98,050 islands in its 188,000 inland lakes. The Saimaa Lake system in the southeast of the country is the fourth largest lake in Europe. By European standards, Finland is very sparsely populated, and around 73% of the country is forested. In the south and southwest, the forest is mainly pine, fir and birch; in Lapland, in the far north, scattered dwarf birch forests give way to Arctic tundra. Most of the national forests are managed for timber, which is used for the manufacture of furniture, paper and fibreboards and for domestic heating and warming Finland's two million saunas. Finland's forests are said to be the most sustainably managed in Europe.",['FI'],1,['FIN']
3944,"A popular year-round destination, France has an affable climate boasting long hot summers and cool winters, which bring snow to higher ground. Summer (June-August) is warm and sunny across much of the country; this is peak tourist season. If you're visiting at this time, prepare to face crowds at major sights, attractions, and coastal resorts, particularly along the French Riviera. Paris is best experienced in spring (March to May) as it is less crowded than summer. Visit the Weather in Paris and the best time to visit Paris guide for more information. If you like intense heat, south of France and St Tropez are sizzling hot in June, July and August. Spring (March-May) and autumn (September-October) are decidedly quieter; prices are also considerably cheaper. Bordeaux is one of France's most popular wine regions and the largest growing wine region in the country. Autumn is the best time to visit as the days are warm and the nights are cooler, plus there are plenty of wine harvest festivals. May and June are also good months to visit, with pleasant weather and wildflowers in bloom. The Alps & Pyrenees draw the crowds during the ski season (December-March) as they fill up the resorts, ready for skiing and winter sports activities. Avid hikers take to the mountains in early June to trek the beautiful trails, lined with wildflowers. Northeastern areas have warm summers and colder winters with rainfall distributed throughout the year and snowfall likely in winter. The Atlantic influences the climate of the western coastal areas from the Loire to the Basque region, where the weather is temperate and relatively mild with rainfall throughout the year. Summers here can be very hot and sunny – sunburn is a risk if you're unprepared. Provence promises one of the prettiest natural spectacles between the last week of June and the first week of August when the lavender fields in The Luberon burst into full bloom. By visiting in mid-June you'll likely miss the tourists, as mid-August is the busiest time of year. Light, breathable clothing for summer and waterproof winter gear for the mountains all year round. In winter, even the Mediterranean resorts often require a sweater or jacket for the cool evenings. France, the largest country in Western Europe, is bordered to the northwest by the English Channel (La Manche), to the northeast by Belgium and Luxembourg, to the east by Germany, Switzerland, and Italy, to the south by the Mediterranean (with Monaco as a coastal enclave between Nice and the Italian frontier), to the southwest by Spain and Andorra, and to the west by the Atlantic Ocean. The country’s loose six-sided shape means it often gets referred to by the informal nickname 'L’Hexagone'. The island of Corsica, southeast of Nice, is made up of two départements. France is home to an astonishing range of scenery, from the mountain ranges of the Alps and Pyrenees to the attractive river valleys of the Loire, Rhône, and Dordogne, and the flatter countryside of Normandy and the Atlantic coast. The country has some 2,900km (1,800 miles) of coastline. Away from the mainland and Corsica, there are several French-administered overseas departments and regions outside of Europe. These include Guadeloupe an island in the Caribbean; Réunion Island, located in the Indian Ocean just east of Madagascar; French Guiana, on the northeastern coast of South America; Martinique, another island in the Caribbean and Mayotte, an island in the Mozambique Channel.",['FR'],1,['FRA']
3945,"Georgia has hot summers with mild winters, particularly in the southwest. Low temperatures are common in alpine areas. Heavist rainfall exists in the subtropical southwest. The best time to visit Georgia is in early-summer (May and June) and early-autumn (September), when temperatures are mild without the humidity and heat associated with July and August. Georgia is a mountainous country bordered by the Russian Federation in the north, Turkey in the southeast, Armenia in the south, Azerbaijan in the east and by the Black Sea in the west, which forms a 330km-long (206 miles) coastline. It includes the two autonomous republics Abkhazia and Ajaria. The state is crossed by the ranges of the Greater Caucasus (highest peak: Mt Kazbek, 5,047m/16,554ft).

3946,"Germany is the seventh largest country in Europe, stretching from the Alps, across the North European Plain to the Baltic Sea. Its climate, however, varies little from north to south. Most of Germany has a temperate seasonal climate moderated by the North Atlantic Drift. Overall, Germany is a year-round destination with warm summers and relatively cold winters – although prolonged period of frost is rare. Rain falls throughout the year, with much of Germany experiencing its maximum rainfall over the high summer months. The highest annual temperatures tend to be in the southwest, where there's almost a Mediterranean feel to the landscape at times and where new heat records are reached almost every year. Unsurprisingly, this is where much of Germany's wine is grown. May through to September are the most popular months in terms of tourist numbers, and certainly hold the most appeal for visitors aiming to spend significant periods of time outdoors. However, April and October (the shoulder months) also hold real attraction for those who want the promise of mild weather without the tourist levels. The winter holidays are also a big draw in their way, as tourists flock to charming Christmas markets scattered across the country. Peak season for ski areas is from December through to the end of March. Berlin is the capital and the largest city in Germany. Geographically it sits in north-eastern Germany and has a temperate continental climate. Berlin's summer is warm with average high temperatures of 23°C (73°F). June and August are rainy too so pack a raincoat with you. Berlin's winter is quite mild with average high temperatures of 3°C (37°F). Home to world-renowned attractions, Berlin rarely witnesses 'slow' periods at any time of year, though prices tend to be slightly higher over the summer months. For more information, see the weather in Berlin and the best time to go guide. Located in west Germany in the Rhine-Ruhr area, Cologne is one of the warmest cities in Germany due to its low lying position. Spring and autumn are the best times to visit Cologne with temperatures averaging 14°C (57°F) in May and 15°C (59°F) in September. The city is aswarm with visitors during ""Crazy Days"" (before Shrove Thursday which falls in February or March) where people dress up and participate in balls and parades.

The city occupies both sides of the Main River and is a year-round destination known for its trade fairs. Summer is warm with average high temperatures of 25°C (77°F). Winter is mild, although it can often get to -1°C (30°F) in the evening. For more information, see the weather in Frankfurt and the best time to go guide. Hamburg is a major port city in northern Germany with a maritime temperate climate. Due to its location, Hamburg is slightly cooler than Berlin which is about 500km (311 miles) south. August is the warmest month and sees an average high of just 22°C (72°F), while winter is cold (although it is also getting milder with less snowfall due to global warming).

3949,"Greece has a warm Mediterranean climate. In summer (June to August), dry hot days are often relieved by stiff evening breezes, especially in the north, on the islands and in coastal areas. Athens can be stiflingly hot, with temperatures occasionally exceeding 40°C (104°F) in July. Winters are mild in the south but much colder in the mountainous north, where it is not uncommon to see snow and temperatures plummeting to well below zero. November to March is the rainy season, most notably on the Ionian Islands. If you are planning a beach holiday, the sea is warm enough to swim from June through September, and hardier types will also manage in May and October. Seaside hotels are generally open from Easter through to late-October, as are water sports facilities. Spring (March to May) and autumn (September to November) are the ideal seasons for hiking and mountain biking, when the days are sunny but not unreasonably hot. Spring sees the Greek countryside dappled with wild flowers, while in autumn the trees take on russet hues. Although few people think of Greece as a winter destination, it is in fact possible to ski and snowboard here. Two of the most popular mountain ski resorts are Arahova (near Delphi) and Kalavrita (on the Peloponnese). Lightweight clothes (cotton is best) during summer months, including protection from the midday sun and sunglasses. Light sweaters are needed for evenings, especially on the islands. Waterproofs are advised for spring and autumn. Winter months can be quite cold, especially in the northern mainland, so normal winter wear will be required. Greece is situated in southeast Europe, bordering Albania, Macedonia and Bulgaria to the north, Turkey to the east and the Mediterranean Sea to the south and west. The mainland consists of the following regions: Central Greece, Peloponnese, Thessaly, Epirus, Macedonia (which, incidentally, borders the country Republic of Macedonia, also known as the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia or FYR Macedonia) and Thrace. High mountains, fertile plains, pine forest and scrub-covered foothills are all found on the Greek mainland. The largest mountain range is the Pindus, which runs north-south through central mainland Greece, and separates the regions of Thessaly and Epirus. The highest mountain is Olympus, which soars 2,917m (9,570ft) - according to Ancient Greek mythology, this is where the 12 Olympian Gods resided. The islands account for one-fifth of the country's land area. The majority are thickly clustered in the Aegean between the Greek and Turkish coasts. The Ionian Islands are the exception; they are scattered along the west coast in the Ionian Sea, looking (both geographically and culturally) towards Italy. The Aegean archipelago includes the Dodecanese, lying off the Turkish coast, of which Rhodes is the best known; the northeast Aegean group, including Chios, Ikaria, Lemnos, Lesvos and Samos; the Sporades, off the central mainland; and the Cyclades, comprising 39 islands (of which only 24 are inhabited).

Spring and autumn are mild, while winters are very cold, as low as -10°C (14°F), and not a good time to visit rural areas – although city breaks are enjoyable at any time of year. The south of the country around Pécs is a little warmer on average, although the region still experiences snowfall in winter. Annual rainfall is an average of 6cm (2.3 inches) and is relatively evenly distributed throughout the year, with snowfall common in winter. Lightweights for summer, medium weight clothing for spring and heavier clothing for autumn and winter. Waterproofs can prove useful at any time of year. Long-sleeved shirts, trousers, boots and hats should be worn to protect exposed skin in forested, grassy and lakeside areas in summer to prevent bites from ticks. Hungary is situated in Central Europe, sharing borders to the north with Slovakia, to the northeast with Ukraine, to the east with Romania, to the south with Croatia and Serbia, and to the west with Austria and Slovenia. Despite much of the country lying lower than 200m (656ft), there are several ranges of hills, chiefly in the north and west. The country’s highest point is Kékes in the Matra Mountains northeast of Budapest, which is 1,014m (3,327ft) high. Other, relatively low, mountain ranges include the North Hungarian Mountains, the Transdanubian Mountains and Mecsek north of Pécs. The lowest point, near Szeged in southern Hungary, is just 77m (253ft) above sea level. The Great Hungarian Plain, which stretches northeast from the Danube to the foothills of the Carpathian Mountains, east to the mountains of Transylvania in Romania, and south to the Fruška Gora range in Serbia, covers more than half of Hungary’s total territory. It is flat and low-lying throughout, never exceeding more than 183m (591ft) in height. The Little Hungarian Plain is similar, but much smaller, and lies in northwest Hungary next to the Austrian and Slovakian borders. Two major European rivers run through Hungary, the Danube and the Tisza. The former flows through Budapest on its way to the Black Sea via Croatia, Serbia, Bulgaria and Romania. The River Tisza, which has its source in Ukraine, flows south through Hungary into Vojvodina in northern Serbia, where it joins with the Danube. Both rivers are navigable in Hungary. Smaller rivers include the Rába, Szamos, Sío and the Drava, which largely defines the Croatian border. Hungary has no coastline, but the country is home to Lake Balaton in west-central Hungary, which is sometimes referred to as the ‘Hungarian Sea’. Lake Balaton is a regionally important freshwater lake, the largest in Central Europe, with a surface area of 592 sq km (229 sq miles). At 78km (48 miles) long and up to 14km (9 miles) wide, it’s Hungary’s largest recreational area and a popular destination for both summer swimming and winter sports. Hungary also has two much smaller lakes: Lake Velence, which is a bird reserve, and Lake Fertö, which straddles the Austrian border near Sopron.",['HU'],1,['HUN']

Rain tends to fall in the cooler winter months between October and December though occasional showers are not unusual at any time of year. The high season runs from June to September, when temperatures are at their highest, and this is the best time to visit for the infamous Ibiza nightlife or beach holidays. To avoid the crowds, visit in May or October when the weather is still sunny, rain is rare, but the party season has either yet to begin or is coming to a close. In winter, the temperature rarely drops under 0ºC (32ºF). From November to April, the average daytime temperature is about 15ºC (59ºF). However, when the sun comes out, this can rapidly climb to 25ºC (77ºF). Light to medium weights and waterproofs if visiting in the wettest season between October and December, with warmer clothing occasionally necessary for cooler evenings. July and August are particularly hot so pack beachwear for the day and loose-fitting clothes for the evening. Ibiza is 571 sq km (220 sq miles), making it the third-largest of the Balearic Islands, an archipelago off the coast of Spain that includes Mallorca, Menorca, Ibiza (Eivissa) and Formentera. It is located in the Mediterranean Sea, 75km (46.6 miles) to the East of the Iberian Peninsula, 82km (51 miles) southwest of Mallorca and 87km (54 miles) away from the Alicante coast. Despite only measuring approximately 35km (21 miles) in length at its longest point, and just 20km (12 miles) in width, Ibiza boasts two mountain ranges, both covered in thick, hardy woodland which inspired early Greek invaders to name Ibiza and neighbouring Formentera the Islas Pitiusas (Islands of Pine Trees). The Pitiusas are surrounded by over 60 small islets, such as S'Espardell, S'Espalmador and Penjats between Ibiza and Formentera, Es Vedrá, Es Vedranell, S'Espartar, Bosc, Bledes and Conillera in the southwest and Tagomago in the northeast. The highest point of Ibiza is Atalaya of Sa Talaiassa de Sant Josep, at 475m (1,561ft), while the land to the south is the lowest point and consists of salt pans that have been exploited since ancient times and continue to be both an industry and tourist attraction.

Apart from sudden changes in weather and temperature, visitors should also expect strong winds and cloudy skies. Rain is common, especially along the south coast. In Reykjavík, the average precipitation is 840mm (33in) a year, but if you move further northeast to Akureyri, rainfall becomes less frequent, averaging about 500mm (20in) a year. Spring (April to May) starts late but temperatures soon climb above the freezing point. In Reykjavík, the average temperature reaches 6°C (43°F) by May. Summer (June to August) is lovely, with long days and mild temperatures. This is the best time to visit Iceland. In Reykjavík, the sky may be cloudy, but with temperatures hovering around 11°C (52°F) and plenty of events taking place, it is hard not to feel happy. Autumn (September to October) starts off relatively warm but temperatures soon drop to an average of 4°C (39°F) by October. Winter (November to March) is long, cold and dark. In Reykjavík, rainfall is frequent but you can also expect a small amount of snow between December and January, with temperatures averaging 0°C (32°F). If you travel north, naturally you can expect a colder climate. Snow is also abundant in the plateaus and mountains. Beware that you only get a few hours of daylight each day, especially in December. As the weather in Iceland can be unpredictable, use layers to keep yourself cool or warm, regardless of which month you go to Iceland. In the winter, add gloves and thermals to your packing list. Waterproof garments are also essential. Another must-bring item is swimwear – even in the winter, Icelanders visit heated pools or geothermal spas to relax. Located near the Arctic Circle, Iceland covers some 103,000km² (39,769mi²) and is the second-largest island in Europe, after Great Britain. Iceland sits on top of two tectonic plates – where the Eurasian and American tectonic plates meet. As the plates split apart gradually, new landmass is being formed and as a result, Iceland grows by about 5cm (2in) a year. The most significant of these seismic features can be seen at Þingvellir (Thingvellir) National Park, particularly along the Almannagjá gorge, which is essentially the space between the tectonic plates. About 11% of the country is covered in glaciers and another 70% is uninhabited. In other words, the landscape of Iceland is wild, untamed but extremely beautiful, dotted with majestic waterfalls, snow-capped volcanoes, moss-covered lava fields and black sand beaches. The moon-like landscape also makes Iceland the ideal training ground for American astronauts. In fact, the Apollo 11 crew were trained in the areas around Húsavík, a small fishing village on Iceland's northern coast.",['IS'],1,['ISL']
3953,"Ireland's relatively temperate climate is due to mild southwesterly winds and the effects of the Atlantic Gulf Stream. Summers are warm – only rarely getting unpleasantly hot – while temperatures during winter are much cooler, although it’s far from common for the temperature to drop below freezing and snowfall is rare. Spring and autumn are very mild, with rainfall expected all year round. The other chief characteristic of the climate, however, is its unpredictability. You might be basking in balmy T-shirt weather one week, then wrapping up to stave off the chill the next – all the while with an umbrella to hand. Lightweights during summer with warmer mediumweights for the winter. Rainwear is advisable throughout the year. If you find yourself lacking anything essential on arrival, of course, all key centres are well stocked with clothing outlets, with the larger cities particularly good in terms of picking up high quality outdoor equipment. And it's worth remembering that certain clothing items which are more commonly seen as souvenirs – hand-knit Aran sweaters, for example – can be practical purchases for the trip itself. The Republic of Ireland lies in the north Atlantic Ocean and is separated from Britain by the Irish Sea to the west. The northeastern part of the island (Northern Ireland) is part of the United Kingdom. There are four provinces: Leinster, which covers the eastern portion of the country around Dublin; Munster, which covers the south; Connacht, which covers the west of Ireland; and Ulster, which is predominantly in Northern Ireland but also covers the northern tip of the Republic. Ireland has a central plain surrounded by a rim of mountains and hills offering some of the most varied and unspoilt scenery in Europe. Inland you’ll find bogs, moors, forests, lakes, mountains and wetlands. Quiet sandy beaches, semi-tropical bays warmed by the Gulf Stream, and rugged cliffs make up the 5,600km (3,500 miles) of coastline. For those who really want to make the most of the coastal scenery (and are keen to see a bit of Northern Ireland too), a full loop of the island – sticking close to the sea at all times – can be done with ease in a couple of weeks.   Together, the landscape and the offshore waters provide a good habitat for a wide variety of wildlife. Seals and dolphins are spotted regularly, while the Cork coast even offers the chance to whale-watch over the summer months. There are numerous rivers in Ireland, the longest of which – the River Shannon, at 360 km (224 miles) in length – is also seen as one of the country’s most picturesque. Other notable waterways include the River Liffey, which flows from the Wicklow Mountains to the Irish Sea, through the centre of Dublin.",['IE'],1,['IRL']
3954,"The climate of the Isle of Man is temperate, with cool summers and mild winters. There is a considerable variation in rainfall over the island, although the average is high in comparison to the rest of the British isles, as the isle of Man is located to the west of mainland Britain and far enough from Ireland for moisture to accumulate on the prevailing south-westerly winds. The driest parts of the island are in the extreme south and over the northern plain, whilst the wettest are the hilly interior and Snaefell. However, frost and snow occur much less frequently than in other parts of the British Isles. Temperatures are consistently cool, although the recorded maximum is almost 29°C. The north of the island lies in a rain shadow and has higher levels of sunshine in general. With consistent temperatures, the Isle of Man is a good year-round destination. However, April, May and June are the driest months, whilst May, June and July are the sunniest and July and August are the warmest. You ought to take a range of clothing suitable for a variety of weather conditions. Ensure that you have waterproof and windproof layers as well as warmer clothing for the evenings. If you are going walking, make sure that you have comfortable, well-broken-in boots with good ankle support. The Isle of Man is an island situated in the Irish Sea, between the United Kingdom and Ireland; modest in size, it is just 53km (33 miles) long and 21km (13 miles) wide. The main towns are located along the coastline, which totals 161km (100 miles) and is dented with small bays. Legend has it that the Isle of Man was created when the Irish giant Finn MacCooill hurled a boulder from Ireland’s coastline towards Scotland during a fight. The boulder fell into the sea and became the island. The island’s terrain is varied; the larger part is formed from highly faulted and folded sedimentary rocks although there is an area of sandstone around Peel. Substantial deposits of copper, lead, silver, zinc and iron can be found on the island and there are also quarries of black marble, limestone, clay and granite. Over two-thirds of the land mass is cultivated. There are two main mountainous areas separated by a central valley that runs from Douglas to Peel. The northern end of the island is a flat plain made up of glacial tills and marine sediment, which leads gently to the sea and long sandy beaches that contrast with the rocky cliffs found elsewhere. At 621m (2,036ft), Snaefell is the only mountain and the highest point on the island. In the south, the island is generally hillier, with distinct valleys. Wooded glens can be found all over the island, often leading to the sea. The longest river on the island is the Sulby, which is 16.9km (10.5 miles) long. Smaller islands and outcrops can be found off the coast, including the Calf of Man at the southern tip and St Patrick’s Isle by Peel.",['GB'],1,['GBR']
3955,"Italy is characterised by a Mediterranean climate with hot, dry summers and cool, wet winters. July is the hottest month with temperatures up to 30C (86F), and January is the coldest month. It is a great destination to visit year round, particularly if taking a city break, though for the warmest and most reliable weather April to June is the prime tourist season. Most Italians take their holiday in July and August so prices, and crowds, can soar during these months, which are also the hottest of the year. If you’re keen to avoid the main scrum of peak season but still bank on mild weather, late September to October is a good choice. Lightweight clothes are worn during the summer, except in the mountains. Winter demands light to mediumweights in the south, but warmer clothes elsewhere. Alpine wear is advised for winter mountain resorts. Italy is a boot-shaped country situated in southern Europe. Jutting out into the Mediterranean Sea, it shares borders with France, Switzerland, Austria and Slovenia in the mountainous north, which contains some of the highest peaks in Europe. In central Italy, Tuscany has a diverse landscape composed of fertile rolling hills, lush river valleys, minor mountain ranges and a long sandy coastline. To the east is Umbria, known as the ‘green heart of Italy' - hilly with broad plains, olive groves and pines, and Le Marche – a region of gentle mountains, rivers and small fertile plains. Further south lies Rome, Italy's capital city. Within its precincts lies Vatican City, the world's smallest country (by landmass). The south of the country is hotter, wilder and much drier than the north, characterised by dry sierras, rocky mountain ranges and volcanic outcrops, including three of Europe’s most active volcanoes: Vesuvius, Etna and Stromboli.

Between June and September, days are pleasantly warm and often sunny. Winters are long and harsh, with temperatures in Riga rarely rising above freezing between December and March. Even in April they can be as low as 5ºC. Rainfall is distributed throughout the year with the heaviest rainfall in August. Snowfall is common in the winter months. Light to medium weight clothes are worn during summer months. Medium to heavyweight clothes are needed during spring and autumn, and heavyweights for the bitterly cold winter. Rainwear is advisable all year. Latvia is situated on the Baltic coast and borders Estonia in the north, Lithuania in the south, the Russian Federation in the east and Belarus in the southeast. The country is divided into five broad regions: Riga in the north, Kurzeme and Zemgale in the west and Vidzeme and Latgale in the east. The country is reasonably flat. A long sandy coastline is backed in places by undulating sand dunes and low sea cliffs. In Latgale, in the east, the landscape is noticeably different with rolling hills and myriad lakes. Wherever you are in Latvia you don't have to travel far to find dense forest. In addition the country boasts about 12,000 rivers. Latvia's longest river, the Daugava runs through Riga.

3961,"Warm weather can generally be expected from May to September. Snow is not uncommon during the winter months, especially in the higher Ardennes regions in the northern half of the country, but this is less reliable than it once was, and has led to the virtual eradication of the former (albeit small) cross-country skiing industry. The north (the Ardennes region) tends to be slightly wetter and slightly colder than the south at all times of year. As has been seen in other regions, weather patterns have become far less predictable in recent years than they used to be, and visitors should be braced for anything whenever they travel. Restaurants, hotels and most visitor attractions in Luxembourg City remain open all year round, and there is no specific high or low season, although certain peak times such as the National Day in June, Easter and Christmas can become booked out well in advance. Many other parts of the country however experience a very distinct low season in January and February, and tourist grinds to a halt in much of the Ardennes. Many smaller hotels and some restaurants shut completely during the winter months, and establishments that remain open often have limited opening hours. Autumn can be a good time to visit the north as the annual turning of the leaves is a wonderful and free natural spectacle, many country hotels have open fires going, and the restaurants offer seasonal menus featuring local game. Waterproofs are advisable at all times of the year. There is no discernible wet or dry season in Luxembourg, and it is best to come prepared for all eventualities. The Grand Duchy of Luxembourg shares borders to the north and west with Belgium, to the south with France and to the east with Germany. Although similar in size to a typical English county, there are a number of distinct geographical regions. Most of the northern half of the country is made up of the high plateau of the Ardennes, carved and scarred by a network of steep-sided thickly forested river valleys. Most of this region is around 500m (1,640ft) above sea level. The southern half – known locally the Gutland or Good Land - is gently rolling lowland, covered with woods and farmland, mostly sitting around 250m (820ft) above sea level. There are no towns of any significant size in the north; the south is more urbanised. In the southeast is the rich wine-growing valley of the Moselle river, which enjoys a unique microclimate well-suited to the cultivation of grapes. The area around Echternach, Larochette and Beaufort is a spectacular region of narrow sandstone micro-gorges and thick forest, which was christened ‘Little Switzerland’ by early tourists. The capital meanwhile, Luxembourg City, is built on a rocky outcrop overlooking the two adjoining gorges of the Alzette and Pétrusse valleys.",['LU'],1,['LUX']
3962,"Mild climate with warm summers and extremely mild winters. Mid-seasonal wear. The group comprises the main island of Madeira, the smaller island of Porto Santo, the three uninhabited islets of Ilheu Chao, Deserta Grande and Ilheu de Bugio, and the Selvagens (a group of uninhabited islets located south of Madeira). The islands are hilly and of volcanic origin and the coast of Madeira is steep and rocky with deep eroded lava gorges running down to the sea. These are particularly impressive on the north coast of Madeira island. The largest of a group of five islands formed by volcanic eruption, Madeira is in fact the summit of a mountain range rising 6.5km (4 miles) from the sea bed. At Cabo Girão, west of the capital of Funchal, is the second-highest cliff in the world. Inland, Pico Ruivo is the island's highest point (1,862m/6,109ft) with the slightly lower Pico de Arieiro (1,810m/5,940ft) nearby. Both are destinations for sightseeing tours, commanding fine views of the surrounding mountains. Madeira's volcanic origin means that it has no sandy beaches, although there is a small beach, Prainha, near the whaling village of Canical on the extreme east of the island. Madeira itself is 56km (35 miles) long and 21km (13 miles) wide. Porto Santo is much smaller, only 14km (9 miles) long and 5km (3 miles) wide, with a long, golden sandy beach.",['PT'],1,['PRT']
3963,"The island enjoys a temperate, Mediterranean climate. The height of summer can get very hot – in excess of 40°C - but the cooling influence of the sea means it's seldom excessively uncomfortable or humid. Summer is the busiest time of the year and prices are at their highest in July and August. During the rest of the year Mallorca has an ideal climate, with comfortable temperatures in the mid- to high-twenties during the spring and autumn months. Combined with fewer visitors and lower hotel prices, this makes for the best time to visit and is also the best time for outdoor activities such as cycling and hiking holidays. The climate during the winter is generally mild and dry with occasional showers, making Mallorca an ideal winter getaway. The shoulder seasons (April-May and September-October) are generally the perfect time to get the best of the weather and to avoid the crowds. The summer months are extremely hot so lightweight clothing is needed. Long-sleeved cotton tops are recommended as they protect from the fierce sun, especially for sightseeing or activities. Autumn and spring attire should be medium-weight clothing, mainly layers, with some light rainwear, while the winters can be cold so a good jacket, scarf and gloves might be necessary. Located in the middle of the Mediterranean Sea, approximately 210km (130 miles) south of Barcelona and 300km (185 miles) north of the African continent (Algeria), Mallorca has an idyllic geographical setting. Measuring 3,640 sq km (1,405 sq miles), it is the largest of the four Balearic Islands (Ibiza and Formentera to the west and Menorca to the east) and has a hugely varied landscape. Its main geographical feature is the Sierra de Tramuntana mountain range, which extends from the southwest to northeast of the island over 70km (44 miles), the highest peak being Puig Major at 1,445m (4,741ft). The coast is mainly rocky, pocketed with small coves, sandy beaches and caves. Three large bays provide shelter from the open seas – Palma Bay, Alcúdia Bay and Pollensa Bay. The interior of the island is covered with lush pine forest, olive and almond trees, and in the central plains agricultural terrain and vineyards. Protected nature reserves are important for wildlife, the most significant of these being the Cabrera Island Marine Reserve and the S’Albufera Nature Reserve near Alcúdia. There are hundreds of bird species that call Mallorca home, although wild mammals are today rare, the main exception being the wild goat that can be seen in the mountainous regions.",['ES'],1,['ESP']

Spring (March to May) sees the number of rainy days gradually drops from nine days in March to three days in May, while the average high goes from 18°C (64°F) in March to 24°C (75°F) in May. This means that May is a good time to visit Malta if you want warm weather and have the opportunity to enjoy tourist attractions without large crowds. Summer (June to August) is peak season and the best time to enjoy a beach holiday in Malta, as rainfall is at its minimum and sunshine is abundant. However, it also means tourist hotspots are thronged with sun worshippers. In July and August, the average high is 32°C (90°F). Autumn (September to November) sees rainfall goes from 40mm (1.6 inches) to 109mm (4.3 inches) as the season progresses. The first half of the season still feels like summer, but by November, the average high is 21°C (70°F). Winter (December to February) is mild, rainy and windy. In January, the average high is 16°C (61°F). Lightweight cottons and linens are worn between April and September, although warmer clothes may occasionally be necessary on cooler evenings. A light raincoat is advisable from October to March. The Maltese archipelago is situated in the centre of the Mediterranean with three inhabited islands – Malta, Gozo and Comino. Malta is the largest inhabited island, lying 97km (60 miles) south of Pozzallo (Sicily) and 363km (226 miles) north of Sfax (Tunisia).

Most of them are from 80km to 160km (50 to 100 miles) long, and are usually flanked by towering mountains. Much of northern Norway lies beyond the Arctic Circle and consequently, mostly takes the form of rugged tundras. The south is covered with pine and larch forests, and dotted with lakes, rivers and mountains.",['NO'],1,['NOR']
3973,"Poland’s climate is temperate with warm (sometimes very hot) summers, crisp, sunny autumns and cold winters. Snow covers the mountainous area in the south of Poland (mid-December to April). Rain falls throughout the year. The most pleasant times to visit Poland are late spring and early summer (May-June) and late summer and early autumn (September-October), when it's still warm and the crowds of tourists have either not yet arrived or already gone home. The added advantages of these shoulder seasons is that you’ll hit the asparagus season in spring and enjoy the best hiking conditions in early autumn. Light- to mediumweights are worn during warmer months. Medium- to heavyweight clothing is needed during winter. Rainwear is advisable all year. You might also want to bring good walking shoes/hiking boots for urban/rural exploration. In general Poles dress casually, but where there is an event on, it’s to the nines. If you expect to attend a wedding or red-letter party, bring something dressy. Poland shares borders with Belarus, Ukraine, Lithuania and the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad to the east and northeast; Czech Republic and Slovakia to the south; and Germany to the west. To the north lies the Baltic Sea. The Baltic coast provides almost 525km (325 miles) of sandy beaches, bays and steep cliffs; between Gdańsk, and the port city of Szczecin to the west there are many seaside towns offering unpolluted water and some fine beaches, with sunbeds and umbrellas available for hire. These sand and gravel deposits also form the shifting dunes of Słowiński National Park, the sand bars of Hel and the Vistula Lagoon. Northern Poland is dominated by lakes, islands and wooded hills joined by many rivers and canals. The Masurian Lake District to the northeast is a patchwork of lakes and forests with Lake Hańcza, the deepest lake in Poland, located here. The longest river, the 1,090km (675 mile) Vistula, or Wisła, rises in the Tatra mountains and empties into the Baltic, cutting a wide valley between the capital, Warsaw in the heart of the country, to Gdańsk on the coast. The rest of the country rises slowly to the Sudety mountains, which run along the border with the Czech Republic, and the Tatra Mountains, which separate Poland from Slovakia. To the west, the River Oder, with Szczecin at its mouth, forms the northwest border with Germany. Poland counts almost two dozen national parks, covering an area of 3,200 sq km (1,235 sq miles), and including the oldest, Białowieża National Park, east of Warsaw on the border with Belarus, and one of the largest, Bieszczady National Park, part of the Carpathian mountain range. These parks are home to European bison (the largest mammal in Europe), brown bears, lynx, wolves and even some wild horses. And Białowieża contains a fragment of the forest that once covered Europe prehistoric times, with some oaks dating back half a millennium. Polish forests are largely pine though, accounting for two-thirds of the total.",['PL'],1,['POL']
3974,"Not surprisingly, considering its close proximity to northern Africa, Portugal is one of the warmest European countries with an average temperature of 15°C (55°F) in the north and 18°C (64°F) in the south, while the Azores and Madeira are wetter and hotter respectively off the coast. It can become rainy and windy during autumn and winter, but spring and summer see temperatures soar to as high as 40°C (104°F) around the interior and 35°C (95°F) in the north. The northwest has mild winters with high levels of rainfall, and fairly short summers. The northeast experiences longer winters and hot summers. In the south, summers (May to October) are warm with very little rain except in early spring and autumn. Snow will fall in the north, but melts quickly. Light- to mediumweights and rainwear are advised (Portugal has one of the highest rainfalls in Europe). In summer, wear very light fabrics, preferably linen, as temperatures can soar and prove very uncomfortable if you have packed wrongly. Should you travel in spring or autumn, pack a combination of both. Portugal juts out into the Atlantic in the far southwest of Europe otherwise known as the Iberian Peninsula. The only country it shares a border with is neighbouring Spain to the north and the east, with the Atlantic Ocean hugging its 800km (500-mile) coastline to the south and west. The country also comprises the Portuguese islands of the Azores and Madeira. The Azores lie around 1,100km (700 miles) west of Lisbon, while Madeira sits just north of the Canary Islands to the west of Morocco. Outside the large urban areas, the countryside is a great deal more rural and sparse than in many other European countries. Portugal is crossed by several rivers which have their origin in Spain. These flow from east to west out into the Atlantic or north to south, the main rivers being the Minho and Douro in the north, and the Tagus and Guadiana in the south. Portugal possesses a high plain of varying height intersected by deep valleys. The north of the country is rugged, mountainous and dotted with vineyards. The high northern point of the Serra da Estrela proves a popular area for skiing, while Serra de São Mamede further south on the Spanish border is a hiking favourite. After the stunning slopes of the central regions, the vast plains of the Alentejo region stretch south of Lisbon, with a range of mountains dividing the Alentejo from the Algarve, whose wide sandy beaches and attractive bays run along the south coast. Approximately half the country is used for agriculture. The capital, Lisbon, sits about two-thirds down the west coast. Porto is also situated on the coast in the northwest of the country. Smaller Faro nestles on the southern end of the country, its airport a busy hub for Algarve sunseekers and swathes of golfers looking for year-round sun. Braga, Coimbra and Setubal are also near the coast and rivers.",['PT'],1,['PRT']
3975,"Romania is a great year-round tourist destination. The best times to visit in terms of climate are the end of April to the beginning of July and from end of August to the end of October as temperatures are mild and pleasant. Summers can be hot especially in Southern Romania, including Bucharest, but along the Black Sea Coast, sea breezes offer moderate temperatures. Winters are coldest in the Carpathian Mountains where there is snow from December through to April. Snow also falls throughout most of the country during winter. The ski season in Romania runs from December to March, although high resorts such as Stana de Vale often remain open until late April. Prices are cheaper at the beginning and the end of the season, with Christmas often the busiest time.   On the Black Sea Coast, tourism reaches its height between June and August and temperatures during the summer months can reach a sizzling 40°C. Look for deals in May and September, when the weather is still balmy but the season isn’t yet in full swing.  Other seasonal activities include bird-watching (from mid-April to mid-May in the Danube Delta) and wine-tasting, which focuses around a series of festivals in September and October. Lightweights are worn in summer on the coast and in low inland areas. Warmer clothes are needed in winter and throughout the year in the uplands. Rainwear is recommended throughout the year. Romania is bordered by Moldova and Ukraine to the north and northeast; the Black Sea to the east; Bulgariato the south; and Serbia and Hungary to the west. The country is divided into 41 counties, but essentially there are four geographical regions with decidedly different characters; Transylvania, Moldova, Dobrogea and Muntenia.  Transylvania and Moldova comprise the northern half of the country and are characterised by Alpine massifs and dense forests. The Carpathian Mountains run along the border of these two regions and are made up of 14 mountain ranges above 2,000m (6,560ft) with Moldoveanu Peak at 2,544m (8,300ft) the highest point. The terrain around here is a mix of extinct volcanic cones, lunar plains, thick forests and glacial lakes – perfect for hiking, cycling and adrenaline sports. Muntenia, also known as Wallachia, lies south of the Carpathians and is home to the capital Bucharest. A relatively flat province, its border with Bulgaria is defined by the River Danube. In the southeast lies Dobrogea, which is home to the Danube Delta. The best-preserved delta in Europe, it is a haven for wildlife and has been declared a biosphere reserve and biodiversity World Heritage Site by UNESCO. The Dobrogea region boasts nearly 200 km (120 miles) of Black Sea coastline, incorporating the port of Constanta and the Danube Delta. Romania’s other major rivers include the Olt, the Siret and the Mures.",['RO'],1,['ROU']
3976,"As you’d expect Russia’s climate is hugely dependent on where in the country you find yourself. With temperatures known to hit a tarmac-melting 37°C (99°F) in the cities and fall to -30°C (-22°F) and lower during the Siberian winter, there’s no point generalising about Russia’s weather except to say, be prepared. The most favourable temperatures are found along the Baltic coast, where many Muscovites decamp for balmy summer holidays, while the site of the 2014 Winter Olympics, Sochi, also doubles as a beach resort due to its tropical climate, earning it the epithet ‘Florida of Russia’. Minus the overly tanned pensioners of course. While the notion of visiting a snow-blanketed Moscow or St Petersburg has a definite romance, most tourists prefer to come calling in the warm summer months of June, July and August. This means the shoulder seasons of April, May, September and October are good options for visitors keen to avoid the peak crowds – prices are generally lower from September to May, and tourist sites almost invariably less crowded. Spring is often characterised by slushy roads. And if your heart’s set on that winter wonderland, December’s the best bet. Seasonal climates apply elsewhere in Russia – Siberia can have devastatingly cold winters, while its summers are generally fairly pleasant, if a little rainy. The region of Russia near the Black Sea has mild winters, but again attracts a fair amount of rain. Those visiting over summer should pack a mixture of lightweight and mediumweight clothing – natural fibres such as cotton and linen are best. For the winter visitor, meanwhile – layers, layers, layers. Wools and cashmeres are great material for keeping in the warmth. Sturdy shoes are always a good idea, no matter what time of year. The Russian Federation covers almost twice the area of the USA, and reaches from the enclave of Kaliningrad in the west over the Urals and the vast Siberian plains to the Sea of Okhotsk in the east. The border between European Russia and Siberia (Asia) is formed by the Ural Mountains, the Ural River and the Manych Depression. All in all, Russia has 16 international borders with countries including Finland, Lithuania, USA, Japan, Ukraine, Azerbaijan and China. European Russia extends from the North Polar Sea across the Central Russian Uplands to the Black Sea, the Northern Caucasus and the Caspian Sea. Siberia stretches from the West Siberian Plain across the Central Siberian Plateau to the Lena River and takes in the Sayan and Yablonovy ranges in the south. East of Siberia stretches the Russian Far East, a region almost as big as Siberia itself, running to the Pacific coast and including the vast Chukotka and Kamchatka peninsulas. Given the vast size of the country, Russia’s terrain is hugely variable. From the Siberian tundra to the mountains of the Urals, the beaches on the Black Sea coast, and the plains of western Russia, such variable geography means one can experience many different Russias.",['RU'],1,['RUS']
3977,"Temperate. Moderate snow in winter, some brief showers in summer. The atmosphere is clean, typical of low mountain and hill country with sea breezes. Light- to mediumweights and rainwear are required. San Marino is a tiny state bordered by the Italian regions of Emilia-Romagna to the north and east and Marche to the south and west. The landscape is for the most part green with rolling hills, dominated by the three peaks of Mount Titano. Within San Marino lie the capital of the same name and eight villages.",['SM'],1,['SMR']
3978,"The climate in Scotland is primarily oceanic, meaning it is often cool, rainy, and windy, with temperatures a few degrees lower than the rest of the UK. Rain is common throughout Scotland, with the west side (including the Highlands) wetter and warmer than the east, due to the warm air from the Gulf Stream. For instance, Glasgow on the west coast has an average rainfall of 1,300mm (51in) a year, whereas Edinburgh on the east coast receives almost half of that, averaging 700mm (28in) a year. Spring (March to May) is comparatively cold, with Edinburgh seeing an average mean of 11°C (52°F) in May. In Glasgow, temperatures are slightly lower than in Edinburgh. Summer (June to August) is cool and rainy, with very short, sunny periods occurring from time to time. Summer is widely considered to be the best time to visit Scotland as temperatures are warmer than other times of the year. In Edinburgh, the average mean in July is 15°C (59°F). In August, the moors and slopes of the Highlands are draped in purple Scottish heather and are most beautiful. Autumn (September to November) sees temperatures dropping rapidly as the season progresses. This period is also windy, especially in mountainous areas. October is best for visitors who want to experience the colours of autumn and the sound of rustling leaves. Winter (December to January) is cold, with over 100 snowing days in the Highlands, compared to just 15-20 snowing days elsewhere in Scotland. In Edinburgh, the average mean in January is 4°C (39°F). The weather in Scotland is often cool, wet and windy, and can be unpredictable due to the cold air from the north and warm air from the Gulf Stream. Accordingly, use layers to keep yourself warm, even during the summer months. Regardless of when you go, waterproof garments are essential. Scotland shares a land border with England, and is bounded by the Atlantic Ocean to the west and north, and the North Sea to the east. The physical features of mainland Scotland can be categorised into three parts: the Northern Highlands, the Central Lowlands and the Southern Uplands. The Northern Highlands are dominated by a series of mountain ranges such as the Grampians, the Cairngorms, and the Cuillins (on the Isle of Skye). Ben Nevis, at 1,344m (4,409ft) and the highest peak in the British Isles, is in the west of the Highlands. The Central Lowlands, sandwiched between the Highlands and the Southern Uplands, stretches from the Firth of Forth on the east coast to the Firth of Clyde on the west coast. Edinburgh and Glasgow are located on either side of the Central Lowlands. The sparsely populated Southern Uplands lie just north of the land border with England. Hills, lochs and rivers dominate the landscapes. Wanlockhead, a former lead-mining village sitting at 467m (1,532ft) and said to be the highest village in Scotland, is located here. Scotland's longest river is the Tay, which runs 193km (120 mi) from Ben Lui to the Firth of Tay (south of Dundee). Tay is important to the populations of salmon and is regarded as one of the finest angling rivers in Scotland.",['GB'],1,['GBR']
3979,"Serbia has a mild continental climate with cold winters and warm summers. The north of Serbia and the upland regions have a continental climate, with the typical cold winters and hot summers. The summer months of June to August offer a lovely hot climate and little rain. The mountains experience heavy snowfall, and the ski season is generally from December to March. In winter, mediumweight clothing and heavy overcoat; in summer, lightweight clothing and raincoat required. Serbia borders Hungary to the north, Romania to the northeast, Bulgaria to the southeast, Kosovo, Macedonia and Albania to the south, Montenegro to the southwest, Bosnia & Herzegovina to the west and Croatia to the northwest. Northern Serbia is dominated by the flat, fertile farmland of the Danube and Tisa valleys. The scenery varies from rich Alpine valleys, vast fertile plains and rolling green hills to bare, rocky gorges as much as 1,140m (3,800ft) deep, thick forests and gaunt limestone mountain regions. Belgrade, the capital, lies at the confluence of the Danube and Sava rivers.",['RS'],1,['SRB']
3980,"Slovakia lies in a moderate zone and possesses a continental climate with four distinct seasons. The average daily temperature in Bratislava in winter is -2°C (31°F), rising to 21°C (70°F) in the summer. January is the coldest month, the hottest being July and August. The highest peaks are snow-capped 130 days a year. Medium- to heavyweights and sturdy footwear for winter; lightweights for summer. Rainwear is advisable throughout the year. Known in full as the Slovak Republic, Slovakia is a landlocked central European country, bordered by the Czech Republic, Austria, Poland, Hungary and Ukraine. Bratislava, Slovakia’s capital city, sits in the extreme southwestern corner, close to the Austrian border. This bite-sized country boasts an astounding variety of scenery. From mountains, canyons and caves, to lakes, forests and lowland meadows, Slovakia’s natural beauty makes it an appealing year-round destination for outdoor enthusiasts. Almost half of the country is taken up by the Carpathian Arc, a range of mountains stretching across the north. Within the Arc, smaller ranges include the Lesser Carpathians, White Carpathians, Malá (Lesser) Fatra, Vel'ká (Greater) Fatra, High and Low Tatras and the Slovenské rudohorie Mountains (Slovak Ore Mountains).",['SK'],1,['SVK']
3981,"Slovenia has a continental climate with warm summers and cold winters (snowfalls in the Alps). There is a Mediterranean climate on the coast, with the average temperature at 0°C (32ºF) in January and 20°C (79ºF) in July. Summer here is typically warm, with consistent sunshine; whereas the winters are cool and fresh. In the northwest mountainous region of Slovenia, an alpine climate dominates, bringing cold winters and snowfall, with daytime temperatures hovering around 0.5°C (32.9°). Summer in this region, however, is pleasant, with moderately warm summers and light seasonal storms. This region can often feel busy with tourism, especially during the spring and August, when vacationing Italians arrive en masse. The remaining regions broadly experience a continental climate, with consistent sunshiny summers and crisp winters. January is Slovenia’s coldest month. Medium-weight clothing and heavy overcoats in winter; lightweight clothing and raincoats for the summer, particularly for the higher Alpine regions in the north. Mountains, rivers and major north-south and east-west transit routes dominate this compact and strategically important country.

3982,"Spain's climate varies from temperate in the north to dry and hot in the south. As it is a big country with varying terrain and altitudes, climate can be extremely distinctive from one corner to another. Overall, the country has three main climate zones: • The Mediterranean climate from the southern Atlantic coastal region to Andalusia. Blessed with mild temperatures and long days, these places are excellent to visit all year round. • The semi-arid climate in the south-eastern quarter of the country. • The oceanic climate in the Atlantic region (Basque Country, Cantabria, Asturias, and partly Galicia, Castile–León and the Pyrenean valleys). The best time to visit depends on the region and type of travel experience you’re seeking. For a beach vacation, the best months for guaranteed sunshine are June to August. Naturally, these are also the busiest months for tourism along the coast and on the Spanish islands, so be prepared for high prices and crowds. If you're looking to escape the crowds, head inland to cities like Seville and Granada where temperatures are sizzling but streets aren't as crowded as the coastal cities. The shoulder season for travel in Spain is usually late spring and autumn: from April to end of May and October to November. These are when tourist destinations are least crowded and weather is still pleasant. January to February is the best time to ski – there are about 35 ski resorts in Spain and they generally have a good amount of snow and also a fair amount of sunshine. In the Sierra Nevada, the sun can be quite overwhelming even in the snow – come prepared with snow goggles and sunscreen. • Click here to see the weather & best time to visit Madrid guide. From June to August on the coastal areas, casual beach wear such as flip flops, vests, loose fitting clothing and shorts will suffice. It can get unbearably hot in the city, so be prepared to brave the weather with plenty of water, a hat and sunscreen. In between high and low season (April-May; October-November) the climate can be unpredictable in certain parts of the country, be sure to pack your umbrella, raincoat and a light jacket for the night. Spain shares the Iberian Peninsula with its smaller neighbour, Portugal, and is bordered to the northeast by the Pyrenees mountain range that cuts across France and Andorra. Surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea, Spain has numerous stretches of coastline that are extremely crowded, especially in summer. Spain has two main groups of islands that are popular with tourists: the Balearic Islands (Mallorca, Menorca, Ibiza and Formentera) located 193km (120 miles) southeast of Barcelona, and the Canary Islands off the west coast of Africa (mainly Tenerife, Gran Canaria, Fuerteventura, Lanzarote and La Palma). Located in continental Africa, the tiny enclaves of Ceuta and Melilla also form a part of Spain. Mainland Spain is the second highest and most mountainous country in Europe, with an average height of 610m (2,000ft). The Pyrenees stretch roughly 400km (249 miles) from the Basque Country's Atlantic coast. In places the peaks rise to over 1,524m (5,000ft), the highest point being 3,404m (11,169ft). The main physical feature of Spain is the vast central plateau, or Meseta Central, divided by several chains of sierras. The higher northern area includes Castile and León and the southern section comprises Castile-La Mancha and Extremadura. In the south, the high plains rise further at the Sierra Morena before falling abruptly at the great valley of the Guadalquivir. Southeast of Granada is the Sierra Nevada, which runs parallel to the Mediterranean. Its summit Mulhacen, at 3,718m (12,198ft), is the highest point on the Spanish peninsula. The highest peak in Spain is the Pico del Teide on Tenerife in the Canaries, measuring a height of 3,718m (12,198ft).",['ES'],1,['ESP']
3983,"During the winter, thick layers are needed, with wind chill proving particularly problematic. Far north, stick to woollen layers closest to your skin, and avoid cotton socks. Sturdy footwear, scarves, hats and gloves will be required regardless of where you are. During the summer, lighter clothing is all you need. Shorts or jeans and a t-shirt is standard attire, with a light jacket or sweater for the evenings. Cobblestones in the city, and unpaved roads in the countryside, means flat shoes or sandals are best for getting around. Waterproof clothing is recommended year round. With a land mass totalling around 449,964 sq km (173,732 sq miles), Sweden is the fifth largest country in Europe and the largest of the Scandinavian bloc. Sharing land borders with Norway to the west and Finland to the northeast, the country also has 3,218km (2,000 miles) of coastline, much of it on the Baltic Sea. What remains faces the Gulf of Bothnia – a chilly stretch of sea, shared with Finland. To the south, Denmark is another near neighbour and is directly linked to the southern Swedish port of Malmö via the Öresund Bridge. Along with Denmark, Sweden has maritime borders with Germany, Poland, Russia, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia. With a population of over 9 million, most of whom inhabit the cities and the south, the vast majority (78%) of Sweden’s enormous tracts of land are forested, while another 8% is covered in water. The largest lake is Vänern, with an area of 5,655 sq km (2,140 sq miles) and the highest peak is Kebnekaise, which stands 2,104m (6,903ft) above sea level and is part of the Scandinavian mountain chain on the Norwegian border. In the far north, Sweden’s portion of Lapland extends well into the Arctic Circle, with the northernmost outpost of Swedish civilisation to be found in the tiny Lappish town of Treriksröset on the three way border between Finland, Norway and Sweden. The country’s southernmost point is the small fishing village of Smygehuk on the Baltic coast, close to the tiny city of Trelleborg in Skåne County.",['SE'],1,['SWE']
3984,"Famous for its mountain and snow sports, Switzerland enjoys a moderate climate year-round with four distinct seasons, though up in its famous, ski-laden alpine landscapes are colder than those at lower altitudes. The North Atlantic Drift brings mild weather and mixes with dry air from the North Arctic to cause great temperature changes and fluxing rain patterns. That being said, weather is generally never unreasonably humid, too hot or too cold. More precipitation comes down in mountainous regions with higher altitudes, whether rain or snow.  Climatic conditions vary through Switzerland’s four seasons year-round. Many tourists come to Switzerland for winter activities (December-February), particularly the Alps around Christmas time and the New Year, which coincides with the country’s coldest, snowiest weather. January and February’s temperatures range from the low -2°C (28°F) to a more moderate 7°C (45°F). However, warmer spring (March-May), summer (June-August) and autumn (September-November) conditions are more clement and therefore receive plenty of fanfare. Sunny days in Switzerland are perfect for admiring views of its picturesque greenery and are ideal for sightseeing whether you hike, bike or boat. A hot summer’s highest temperature can even surpass 30°C (86°F).  Zurich, in the north, is the largest city in Switzerland. It has a temperate climate with winters that call for thick jackets and woollen scarves, as average temperatures typically fall below 5°C (41°F). Precipitation is not uncommon throughout the year, but April and May are the rainiest months and give way to June thunderstorms. With a bustling art scene and plenty of nightlife, finding a good time indoors in Zurich is not difficult.  Geneva, which touches France on the eastern edge of Switzerland, has average winter temperatures of 10°C (50°F) and summers of 23°C (73°C) making all seasons great options for visiting the Jet d’Eau fountain or roaming through the old town with views of the Jura mountains.  Dipping into Italy on the southern tip of Switzerland, Ticino has a temperate, pleasant climate at any given time. It has much sunnier weather and almost halves the national cloud coverage average with clear, unblemished skies. Some even call Mendrisio, the region on the southern end of Ticino, the “Tuscany of Switzerland,” making it the go-to destination for classic Swiss greenery with a Mediterranean flare.  Bern, the capital of Switzerland, mixes the country’s temperate climates with ideal skiing conditions in the Bernese Oberlands. Summer visitors should pack an umbrella as June through August is Bern’s rainiest period. Temperatures can also dip to lows near 0°C (32°F) in the winter, so those venturing to the mountains will want to wear a thick coat to brave typically unpredictable Swiss weather. In winter, pack warm clothes and rainwear. Those planning on hiking in the Alps should remember hiking boots, waterproof layers, hats and coats. Lightweight jackets and clothes are recommended for summer; though still do bring an umbrella in case Switzerland’s varied weather strikes. Landlocked Switzerland shares borders with France to the west, Germany to the north, Austria and Liechtenstein to the east and Italy to the south. It has some of the highest mountains in Europe, together with waterfalls, rivers and lakes set amid green pastures. The highest peaks are Dufourspitze, 4,634m (15,203ft), on the Italian border; the Dom, 4,545m (14,911ft); the Matterhorn, 4,478m (14,691ft); and the Weisshorn, 4,506m (14,783ft).",['CH'],1,['CHE']

The north of the island tends to be a little cooler with more chance of cloudy days. Lightweight except in winter when the evenings can be cool. Warm clothing is required for visiting the mountain areas in winter. Tenerife is the largest of the seven Canary Islands and lies in the Atlantic Ocean approximately 320km (200 miles) off the border between Morocco and Western Sahara, and 1,300km (812 miles) from the Iberian Peninsula.

3986,"Turkey is a huge country, and its climate varies widely from region to region as well as seasonally. For sightseeing holidays to Istanbul and the most important ancient and medieval sights, and for active walking holidays, the best times to visit are spring (April-May) and autumn (October-early November) when days are generally warm and sunny but not uncomfortably hot. Rainy spells and cloudy days are possible, however, in spring and autumn, so the best months for a sun-and-sea holiday on the Aegean or Mediterranean coast are June to end September. Resort areas are most crowded from June until the end of August. In developing ski areas such as Uludag near Bursa and Palandoken near Erzurum, the best time to visit is between December and April. Temperatures in and around Istanbul can vary from well below freezing in midwinter to above 40°C (104°F) in summer. The Aegean and Mediterranean coasts experience the hottest summers, with highs of 45°C (113°F), but midwinter temperatures can be as low as -5°C (23°F). Mountainous Eastern Turkey has the most extreme climate of all, with winter temperatures as low as -43°C (-45F) and highs up to 38C (100F). The climate of the central Anatolia is also extreme with summer highs of 40°C (104°F) and winter lows of -25°C (-13°F). The Turkish State Meteorological Office (www.mgm.gov.tr) provides a day to day, region by region online weather forecast. Depending on where you are, appropriate clothing will vary widely. If visiting during the summer take light cotton layers and a hat, as temperatures can reach scorching, particularly in the cities. During the winter months pack heavier layers and waterproofs. Sturdy shoes and equipment are advisable for anyone who will be trekking in the mountainous areas. Turkey borders the Black Sea, Georgia and Armenia to the northeast, Iran to the east, Iraq to the southeast, Syria and the Mediterranean to the south, the Aegean Sea to the west and Greece and Bulgaria to the northwest. Asia Minor (or Anatolia) is the name given to the peninsula that forms a bridge between Europe and Asia. It accounts for 97% of the country's area and forms a long, wide peninsula 1,650km (1,025 miles) from east to west and 650km (400 miles) from north to south. The biggest city is Ankara, which is situated in the central plains of Anatolia. The other 3% of the country is Thrace, the tiny land mass which is the European portion of Turkey bordering Bulgaria and Greece and separated from Anatolia by the Bosphorus, a strait linking the Black Sea and Aegean Sea. Despite its small size 10% of the population lives here, with most of these in Istanbul. Two east-west mountain ranges, the Black Sea Mountains in the north and the Taurus in the south, enclose the central Anatolian plateau, but converge in a vast mountainous region in the far east of the country. It is here that the ancient Tigris and Euphrates rivers rise.",['TR'],1,['TUR']

3988,"There is never a bad time to visit the United Kingdom, but for the most reliable weather come during the summer months (June-August) when the days are long and warm. Temperatures have been known on occasion to nudge 30°C (86°F), sometimes higher, but the threat of rain is ever present - pack waterproofs as well as the sunscreen. The southeast of England is generally sunnier and warmer than the rest of the United Kingdom, but resorts along the coast get crowded during the summer. The United Kingdom is arguably at its most beautiful during the autumn months (September-November), when rural landscapes take on brown, red and pink hues as the leaves lose their pigment. Scotland and the north of England bear the brunt of winter (November-March), but snow occasionally blankets much of the United Kingdom bringing with it travel chaos. The mercury has been known to dip to -10°C (14°F), but those kind of temperatures are rare. Waterproofing throughout the year. Warm clothing is advisable at all times, and is essential for any visits to upland areas. The British landscape can be divided roughly into two kinds of terrain - highland and lowland. The highland area comprises the mountainous regions of Scotland, Northern Ireland, northern England and North Wales. The English Lake District in the northwest contains lakes and fells. The lowland area is broken up by sandstone and limestone hills, long valleys and basins such as the Wash on the east coast. In the southeast, the North and South Downs culminate in the White Cliffs of Dover. The coastline includes fjord-like inlets in the northwest of Scotland, spectacular cliffs and wild sandy beaches on the east coast and, further south, beaches of rock, shale and sand sometimes backed by dunes, and large areas of fenland in East Anglia. Note: The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland consists of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Although they form one administrative unit (with regional exceptions), they have had separate cultures, languages and political histories. The United Kingdom section consists of a general introduction (covering the aspects that the four countries have in common) and sections devoted to the four constituent countries. The Channel Islands (Alderney, Guernsey, Jersey, Sark and Herm) and the Isle of Man are dependencies of the British Crown. These are included here for convenience of reference. More detailed geographical descriptions of the various countries may be found under the respective travel guides.",['GB'],1,['GBR']
3989,"The best time to visit Vatican City is during the months of April, May, September and October, when there are less crowds and the days are long and sunny, but without the heat and humidity of July and August. The Vatican City is situated entirely within the city of Rome, sprawling over a hill west of the River Tiber, and separated from the rest of the city by a wall. Vatican City comprises St Peter's Church, St Peter's Square, the Vatican and the Vatican Gardens.",['VA'],1,['VAT']
3990,"Wales tends to be wetter than England, with slightly less sunshine. Temperatures in the coastal areas, however, can be very warm in summer ranging from 15°C (59°F) to rare highs of around 25°C (77°F). Conditions in upland areas such as the peaks of Snowdonia or the Brecon Beacons can be changeable at all times of the year. Be prepared for sudden downpours in summer as well as winter. The summer months of June to August are the hottest, though they are also the busiest as they coincide with the school holidays. Beaches are heaving with families, hotels are rammed and attractions are a frenzy of queues. For those able to travel outside of the holidays, May and September will offer lovely warm days without the hectic crowds. Similar to the rest of the UK, dress according to season. Waterproofs are advised for both the winter and summer; take a look at the weather forecast before embarking on outdoorsy activities. Take strong hiking boots if doing any trekking through mountainous areas, and warm clothes such as fleeces and thermals are likely to be required for upland areas. During summer if the weather is good, lightweight fabrics are fine, although it is always sensible to take some heavier layers, just in case the weather turns. Wales is a country of great geographical variation with many long stretches of attractive and often rugged coastline. South Wales is mainly known for its industrial heritage but the western part of the coast between Carmarthen Bay and St David's is similar to that of the more pastoral west country of England, and backed by some equally beautiful countryside. The scenery of Mid-Wales includes rich farming valleys, the broad sandy sweep of Cardigan Bay and rolling hill country. North Wales is one of the most popular tourist areas in the British Isles, with many lively coastal resorts. Inland, the mountainous region of Snowdonia has long been popular with walkers and climbers. Much of the central inland area of the country is mountainous, with some breathtaking scenery; many striking lakes can be found inland. The region of Snowdonia in the north covers an area of 2,130 sq km (822 sq miles), extending from the north and western coasts of Wales, inland towards Bala and Llandrillo. Snowdon is the second highest peak in Britain, after Scotland’s Ben Nevis, standing at 1,085m (3,560ft) above sea level. Further south, the Brecon Beacons is another mountain range running from Hay on Wye in the east to Llandeilo in the west, covering 1,344 sq km (519 sq miles). The highest peak in the range is Peny Y Fan 886m (2907ft).",['GB'],1,['GBR']
3991,"June to October, hot and humid (32°C/89°F), December to April, mild (15-25°C/59-77°F). December through to March can be quite cool. Rainfall is slight and occurs mainly in winter. The best time to visit Bahrain is between February to April and October to December when the sky is free from heat haze and the weather sunny without being oppressive. The times to avoid, other than the punishing mid-summer months, are Ramadan (when restaurants are closed during the day) and the two Eid holidays (when hotels are in high demand from Saudi visitors). Lightweight cottons and linens from spring to autumn, mediumweight clothes from November to March. Warmer clothes are necessary in winter and on cool evenings. Bahrain is a mostly flat archipelago of desert islands off the east coast of Saudi Arabia. The main island has a supply of fresh water, unique in the region, both on land and offshore. There are extensive date plantations and market gardens near Manama. The strategic 25km-long (16 miles) King Fahad Causeway links Bahrain with Saudi Arabia and a new causeway will in future link Bahrain with Qatar.",['BH'],1,['BHR']
3992,"The size of Iran means that can temperatures can vary hugely, depending on which corner of the country you find yourself in. Days can be incredibly hot between May and October, particularly in the desert regions and along the Gulf Coast, while the mountain ranges of the north become freezing over winter. Nights can be especially cold. In general terms, major cities like Tehran, Esfahan and Tabriz have seasons broadly equivalent to those in Mediterranean Europe. Iran has a relatively low rainfall, but is prone to earthquakes. Those travellers hoping to ski will find most action between November and March, while it’s advisable for all visitors to look into timings of festivals like Ramadan before booking a trip. In Tehran, lightweight clothing is worn from April to October while mediumweights are advised from November to March. Be reminded, however, that dress should always err on the side of conservatism, particularly for women – the wearing of headscarves is obligatory in public. Tropical attire is worn from April to October. Mediumweights are advised from November to March. Iran is located in the Middle East, bordered to the north by Turkmenistan, Azerbaijan, Armenia and the Caspian Sea, the east by Afghanistan and Pakistan, the south by the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman, and the west by Iraq and Turkey. The centre and east of the country are largely barren undulating desert, punctured by qanats (irrigation canals) and green oases, but there are mountainous regions in the west along the Turkish and Iraqi borders and in the north where the Elburz Mountains rise steeply from a fertile belt around the Caspian Sea.",['IR'],1,['IRN']
3993,"Summers are very hot and dry but cooler in the mountains in the north and east. Winters are mild with some rain in central and southern Iraq but cold in the north. Long, loose clothing in natural fabrics is advised for summer months. Medium-weights are advised during the winter. Modest dress is advised, especially for women - upper legs and arms, shoulders and cleavage should be covered. A headscarf can be useful for extra coverage, and is essential for visiting mosques.In Iraqi Kurdistan dress for women is very western; in the towns in the north at least half of the women do not wear headscarves and wear western fashions though this does not include short skirts, shorts or obvious cleavage. Iraq shares borders with Turkey, Iran, the Gulf of Oman, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Jordan and the Syrian Arab Republic. There is also a neutral zone between Iraq and Saudi Arabia administered jointly by the two countries. Iraq's portion covers 3,522 sq km (1,360 sq miles). The country's main topographical features are the two rivers, the Euphrates and the Tigris, which flow from the Turkish and Syrian Arab Republic borders in the north to the Gulf in the south. The northeast is mountainous, while the country in the west is arid desert. The land surrounding the two rivers is fertile plain, but the lack of effective irrigation has resulted in flooding and areas of marshland.",['IQ'],1,['IRQ']
3994,"Israel generally has two seasons — summer (Apr-Sep) and winter (Oct-Mar). Cities along the west coast (Haifa, Netanya, Tel Aviv) experience a Mediterranean climate with long, hot summers and mild, rainy winters. In Tel Aviv, January is usually cool with an average high of 17°C (63°F) and an average low of 8°C (46°F). Also expect 70-110mm (8-12 inches) of rain per month from November to February. July and August are hot and humid; August is usually the hottest month with an average high of 31°C (88°F). The best time to visit Tel Aviv is from March to May and September to October, as the weather is pleasant and rainfall is at its lowest. The climate gets more arid as you move further inland. Jerusalem, for example, has dry and pleasant summers and cool winters. January is usually the coolest month with average temperatures hovering around 8°C (46°F). January is also the wettest month. Snow is rare though. The period between April to September is pleasant with little rain; this is the best time to visit Jerusalem. Eilat, Israel's water sport paradise on the Red Sea, has a hot desert climate with extremely little rainfall, making it a year-round holiday destination. Click here for more information on this weather in Eilat and the best time to visit guide. Lightweight clothes for warmer months and also for Eilat. Medium weights are recommended for winters or for nights spent in the desert as the temperature can drop considerably. Israel is on the eastern Mediterranean, bordered by Lebanon and Syria to the north, the Palestine National Authority (West Bank) and Jordan to the east, and Egypt to the south. Gaza, a small coastal strip between Israel and Egypt, is claimed by the Palestine National Authority, but under de facto rule by the militant group Hamas. Although relatively small in size, Israel contains a great variety of terrain and four climate zones. The north of the country is the fertile hill region of Galilee, rising to Mount Hermon and Golan in the northeast. The lush Plain of Sharon runs along the coast, while inland a range of hills and uplands run into the relatively barren and stony areas of the east. Temperatures vary widely throughout the country. The coastal area has long, hot summers and cool, rainy winters. The northern Negev desert has a semi-arid climate while the southern Negev (including Eilat on the Red Sea) has a hot desert climate with extremely little rainfall. The Dead Sea (the lowest point in the world) sits on Israel's eastern border along the great Syrian-African Rift Valley. Israel's largest freshwater lake, the Kinneret (also known the Sea of Galilee), is an important source of drinking water for the country and a significant religious destination for Jewish and Christian pilgrims. Owing to its location on climatic and geographical crossroads, where the northern steppes of Europe meet the Syrian-African Rift Valley, Israel has a surprisingly varied flora and fauna. It has an estimated 2,867 species of flora and approximately 100 species of mammals. The country is also a crucial stop-over on the great bird migrations as they make their way north and south twice a year. The Israel Nature and National Parks Authority is responsible for more than 70 national parks and more than 200 nature reserves in Israel.",['IL'],1,['ISR']
3995,"Jordan is a year-round destination. Even in high summer (June-August), Amman and most areas around the country are not excessively hot, chiefly due to the moderating influence of altitude – Amman stands around 850m (2800ft) above sea level. Similarly, Petra enjoys an elevated position – around 1,100m (3600ft) above sea level, so here, too, although days in summer can be hot, nights are often rather chilly. For Petra, as well as decent walking shoes – the only way in and out of the ruins is by a moderately testing walk over stony ground – also bring something warm for the evenings, even in summer. In winter, Petra can be very cold, with rain and even snow. The Jordan Valley and the Red Sea coast around Aqaba is warm during winter (December-February) – a pleasant relief from the chill elsewhere – but extremely hot in summer (June-August). In the Eastern Desert, the winter can be bitterly cold and dry and the summer intensely hot. Some high-altitude areas, such as Ajloun, Dana and Petra, can receive snowfall in winter. Rain falls in many areas across the country on higher ground between October and March. Lightweight clothes are advised between May and September. Thick winter clothes are essential for winter and a warm layer is necessary for cool summer evenings. Rainwear is advisable from November to March. Jordan borders Israel (and the Palestinian National Authority Region), the Syrian Arab Republic, Iraq and Saudi Arabia. At 400m (1,300ft) below sea level, the Dead Sea, in the northwest of Jordan, is the lowest point on earth and one of the country's most distinctive features. The Red Sea, to which Jordan has a narrow access at Aqaba in the southwest, is teeming with life. The River Jordan flows into the Dead Sea, and there are plans to build a canal - the Two Seas Canal (or the Dead-Red Canal) - that would link the Dead Sea to the Red Sea. Capital Amman perches above the Dead Sea Depression, at a height of 800m (2,625ft), surrounded to the north by undulating hills, and by desert escarpments to the south, on which graze the sheep and goat herds of nomadic tribes. Jordan's northeastern flank is flat desert sprinkled with oases, while the spectacular southeastern desert is characterised by wind-eroded forms and brightly coloured sandstone cliffs.",['JO'],1,['JOR']
3996,"Kuwait shares European weather patterns but is hotter and drier. Summers (April to October) are hot and humid with very little rain. Winters (November to March) are cool with limited rain. Springs are cool and pleasant. Kuwait shares borders with Iraq and Saudi Arabia. To the southeast lies the Persian Gulf, where Kuwait has sovereignty over nine small islands (the largest is Bubiyan and the most populous is Failaka). The landscape is predominantly desert plateau with a lower, more fertile coastal belt.",['KW'],1,['KWT']
3997,"Lebanon has a typically Mediterranean climate. There are four distinct seasons. Summer (June to September) is hot on the coast and cooler in the mountains. Spring and autumn are warm and pleasant and are the ideal times to visit for sightseeing. Winter (December to mid March) is mostly rainy, with snow in the mountains so this is the ideal time to visit to enjoy winter sports, but at lower altitudes sightseeing can be hindered by heavy rainfall. Lightweight fabrics such as cotton and linen are best for the summer months and warm clothes for the winter period with rain protection or thermal clothing for higher altitudes. Lebanon lies to the east of the Mediterranean, sharing borders to the north and east with the Syrian Arab Republic, and to the south with Israel/Palestinian Territory. The country possesses four distinct zones from west to east including the coastal plain, the Mount Lebanon Range, the Bekaa Valley and the Anti Lebanon range that forms its border with Syria. Lebanon is a mountainous country with approximately half of its landscape lying at an altitude of over 900m (3,000ft). For its relatively diminutive size, Lebanon offers a surprisingly diverse landscape from the fertile Bekaa Valley to the snow capped peaks of the Anti Lebanon and cedar forests of Mount Lebanon. The famous cedar trees grow high in the mountains, while the lower slopes are cultivated with grapes, apricots, plums, peaches, figs, olives and barley, often on terraces painstakingly cut out from the mountainsides. On the coastal plain, citrus fruit, bananas and vegetables are also grown.",['LB'],1,['LBN']
3998,"Because Oman is so large and the terrain diverse, the climatic conditions are as varied as the geography. The most popular time to visit is from October to April when the weather is warm and sunny and temperatures range from a very pleasant 25°C (77°F) to around 35°C (95°F) during the day. It is cooler at night, ranging in temperature from 17°C (63°F) to 19°C (66°F). From May to August, it is very hot and humid at the coastal areas, while the interior generally remains hot and dry. Between May and September, the southern Dhofar region has its own microclimate. Known as the khareef, the area catches the Indian Ocean’s monsoon season and temperatures can be 10-15°C (18-27°F) lower than the rest of the country. Most of the rain falls during the winter months and varies according to the region. Other than in Dhofar, it is rare to see rain between May and November. The coastal areas and the interior plains average 20-100mm (0.8-4 inches) of rainfall annually but this can rise to around 900mm (35 inches) in the mountains. It is common to see snowfall on the highest mountain peaks during the winter. Lightweight cottons are advisable throughout the year, with a warm wrap for cooler winter evenings, mountain excursions and overworked air-conditioning in shops and restaurants. When touring, khaki or beige are more suitable colours to wear than white, as the dry, dusty conditions can discolour clothing. Oman is a Muslim country and, while it is relatively moderate, visitors should be sensitive to its customs. Women should not bare shoulders or show low cleavage and should not wear short shorts or short skirts. Long shorts should ideally be below the knee. They should also carry a large scarf or pashmina with them at all times in case they need to cover their head. This is essential when visiting mosques. Men should only wear long, baggy shorts, and preferably trousers outside hotels. Swimming costumes are confined to hotel pools and beachwear should be modest. Most hotels do not require women to cover up when swimming, although women may choose to do so when bathing in the sea on public beaches. The Sultanate of Oman occupies the southeastern edge of the Arabian Peninsula and a total area of 309,500 sq km (119,500 sq miles or roughly the same size as Italy) including the coastal islands of Masirah, Halanyat and Salama, plus Musandam and Madha, which are completely surrounded by the United Arab Emirates. It is bordered by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to the northwest, the Republic of Yemen to the southwest and the United Arab Emirates to the north. Oman has 2,092 km (1,300 miles) of coastline on the Gulf, Arabian Sea and the Gulf of Oman. The interior is covered by a vast expanse of desert with around 82% of the landmass occupied by deserts and valleys. The Hajjar mountain range, which occupies around 15% of the country’s landmass, forms an arc extending from the northwest of the country to the southeast. The highest mountain is Jabal Shams, at around 2,980m (9,777ft).",['OM'],1,['OMN']
3999,"Palestine has a temperate, Mediterranean climate. The rainy season in Palestine is between November and April. Winter can get rather cold and wet. Southern areas can get uncomfortably hot during the summer months. Spring and autumn are the best times to visit, with temperatures of around 23°C (74°F). The desert can get cold at night, even during the summer months, so it is advisable to carry extra layers to wear. Otherwise, lightweight clothes are advisable in summer. Warmer clothes are required for the winter months. The two territories of Palestine lie within Israel, around 40km (25 miles) apart at their closest point. The West Bank is to the west of the River Jordan, bordered by Jordan to the east and Israel to the north, south and west. The Gaza Strip, in Israel's southwest, is a narrow stretch of land bordered by the Mediterranean to the west and Egypt to the south. The Great Rift Valley follows the path of the River Jordan running along the West Bank and through the lowest point in the world, the Dead Sea at 390m (1,280ft) below sea level, before continuing on into Eastern Africa. The Jordanian Valley is green and fertile; the south contains the Judean Desert.",['PS'],1,['PSE']
4000,"Occupying a small land on the eastern coast of the Arabian Peninsula, the sovereign state of Qatar has a dry, subtropical desert climate with low annual rainfall and intensely hot and humid summers. The weather in Qatar can be broadly grouped into two seasons: hot (May to October) and cool (December to February). March, April and November are transitional months, meaning the weather is hot but tolerable. The best time to visit Qatar is from December to February when the temperatures are mild with average highs ranging between 22°C (72°F) and 25°C (77°F). January is the coolest month with temperatures ranging from 14°C (57°F) to 22°C (72°F). Temperatures start to climb in February and by March, the average high is back to 29°C (84°F). November and March are ideal times to visit too if you like warmer temperatures. Although the cool period is the best time to visit Qatar, bear in mind that rainfall, however scarce, occurs during this period too, and the rains come mostly in heavy cloudbursts and thunderstorms. The hot period (May to October) is best avoided. July is often considered the hottest month with temperatures ranging from 32°C (90°F) to 43°C (109°F) – although it's not unusual for the thermometer to reach an eye-watering high of 50°C (122°F) in July and sometimes August. If you're visiting during the hot period, you may find yourself seeking refuge in one of the many air-conditioned malls. After October, things start to cool down and by November, you can expect an average high of 30°C (86°F). Because Qatar is a small and flat country, there is little regional variation in the weather, although coastal areas may be slightly cooler than inland. Doha, the capital of Qatar, is highly urbanised which can make the weather in Doha feel slightly hotter than it is. See our guide on weather in Doha and the best time to visit. Lightweight cotton and linen are recommended throughout the year. A cardigan is useful for the cooled malls while a jacket is a must for cooler evenings during the cool season. If you intend to take a camping trip from January to March, you'll be glad to have packed an extra layer of clothing for night time. Although women visitors do not need to wear a hijab (headscarf) or abaya (full-length black cloak), loose-fitting cotton dresses that cover your shoulders and knees are ideal. Avoid anything that is tight or revealing. Men should also dress modestly. Beware that bikinis and beachwear are acceptable at the hotel pool but not in public places. The Qatar peninsula is about 160km (99 miles) from north to south and 80km (50 miles) from east to west. Much of the country consists of low-lying desert but has elevated limestone plateau in the centre of the country. There are no rivers or freshwater lakes in Qatar. On the east coast of Qatar, there is a large area of mangroves near Al Khor on the northeastern side. The coastline then transforms into large sabkha (salt flats) as it inches towards the southeastern end. In the south of the country, Khor Al Adaid, translated to as 'Inland Sea', is where the sea, together with the surrounding large tidal embayment, spills into the desert, creating a unique landscape. On the northern side of the country, there are small pockets of agricultural lands used for growing dates, along with some vegetable patches. On the west coast of Qatar lies the Dukhan Field, the country's main oil field. Geographically, there are several small hills stretching from Dukhan towards the border with Saudi Arabia.",['QA'],1,['QAT']
4001,"Saudi Arabia has a desert climate characterised by dry, hot summers and mild winters. Rainfall is scarce, and sharp temperature changes between day and night should be expected. Spring (March to June) is warm, though the temperatures at night can dip below 15°C (59°F) in the north, but in the south (particularly around Abhā in the southwest), spring is the rainiest season. Summer (June to September) is long and hot; it is usual to see the temperature hitting 45°C (113°F). However, the hilly southwest is much cooler. Autumn (October to November) is still relatively warm with day time temperatures hovering around 30°C (86°F), although evenings are pleasant, with temperatures dropping to around 15°C (59°F) in most cities. Winter (December to March) is the best time to visit Saudi Arabia as the weather is mild with plenty of sunny days and cool nights. It is possible to see snow in the north – you may even be lucky enough to try snow sledging in the mountains around Tabuk. Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia, sits on a rocky plateau in the centre of the country. Its relatively high elevation (594m or 1950ft above sea level) means that it is sunny year-round and less humid than other Saudi cities. July and August are the warmest months with an average temperature of 36°C (97°F). The period between June and September is also dry with no rain at all, while the months between November and April receive about 100mm (4in) of rain. Jeddah, a major port city on the Red Sea coast, has hot and humid weather. July is the hottest month in Jeddah with an average high of 38°C (100°F) while January is the coolest month with an average high of 28°C (82°F). The city receives very little rain, averaging just 20mm (0.8in) a year. The evenings are mild in Jeddah and they offer opportunities to enjoy the waterfront, the Jeddah Corniche, which features miles of sandy beaches and three swimming bays. Makkah, also spelt Mecca, is the holiest city in Islam as it was here that the Quran was first revealed to the Prophet Muhammad. The city sits in a desert valley 86km (53mi) east of Jeddah. Daytime temperatures often hover above 40°C (104°F) between May and September but the evenings are cooler. The weather in January is most pleasant, with an average high of 31°C (88°F) and an average low of 19°C (66°F). Pack sunscreen, sunglasses and sun hats, and use layers (light sweaters or scarves) for air-conditioned buildings and cooler evenings. A rain jacket may be required, depending on when and where you are going. The largest country in the Arabian Peninsula, Saudi Arabia is bordered to the northwest by Jordan, to the north by Iraq and Kuwait, to the east by the Persian Gulf, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, and to the south by Oman and Yemen. To the west lies the Red Sea. Along the Red Sea coast is a narrow coastal plain (Tihamah), which is hot and humid throughout the year. Beyond the plain is a series of hills and mountains, and in the southwest, near Abha, is where you will find Jabal Sawda, the highest point of the Kingdom standing at 3,133m (10,279ft) above sea level. 95% of Saudi Arabia is desert. Rub' Al Khali, meaning the Empty Quarter, occupies 650,000 sq km (250,966 sq mi) in the south-eastern part of the country. This is the largest desert in the Arabian Peninsula and is absolutely beautiful – visitors can expect undulating sand dunes rising from the ground and rolling away to a distant horizon. Another sizable desert is Al Nufud Al Kabir, located near the borders with Iraq and Kuwait. The sand dunes here can be shaped into mounds towering over a hundred meters.",['SA'],1,['SAU']
4002,"The Syrian Arab Republic's climate is characterised by hot, dry summers and fairly cold winters. Nights are often cool. Lightweights are essential in summer with protective headwear. Heavy winter clothing is advisable from November to March. The country can be divided geographically into four main areas: the fertile plain in the northeast, the plateau, coastal and mountain areas in the west, the central plains, and the desert and steppe region in the central and southeastern areas. The Euphrates flows from Turkey in the north, through the Syrian Arab Republic, down to Iraq in the southeast. It is the longest river in the Syrian Arab Republic, the total length being 2,330km (1,450 miles), of which 600km (370 miles) pass through the Syrian Arab Republic. The Khabur River supports the al-Khabur Basin in the northeast.",['SY'],1,['SYR']
4003,"The UAE draws sunseekers from all corners of the globe due to the fact that it is blessed with year-round sunshine, blue skies and very little rain. The best time to visit is between October and April, when temperatures hover at a pleasant 25-28°C (77-82°F) and the Gulf is perfect for swimming. The hottest time of year is during the sweltering summer months of June to September, when humidity can seem unbearable and temperatures can skyrocket to 45°C (113°F). The country is well prepared for hot weather, however, with temperature controlled swimming pools and permanently air-conditioned hotels, malls, taxis and metros. Rain and wind can occur in January through March. Layering is your best bet; wear light clothing outside and bring a jumper or sweatshirt for the heavily air-conditioned buildings around the cities. During November to March, warmer clothes are advised for evening. A hat and high factor sun block is also advisable - a day on the beach in the strong summer sun is an easy recipe for sunstroke and sunburn. If visiting during the summer, make like the residents and visit the beaches early in the morning and later in the evening. The UAE sits at the top right hand corner of the Arabian Peninsula bordered by Oman in the east and Saudi Arabia in the south. All of the Emirates bar one sit on the on the Persian Gulf opposite Iran, and cover a distance spanning 650 km (404 miles) along the coastline. Fujairah is the only Emirate that sits on the Gulf of Oman. The UAE covers an area of 83,600 sq km (32,300 sq miles), Abu Dhabi covers 87% of the country's land mass, which has a consistent terrain of mainly desert. It is home to native animals such as gazelles and the Arabian oryx, which was reintegrated into the area 40 years after it was hunted to extinction. Whilst 80% of the land mass is desert, other ecological terrain includes mountain areas and marine coastal areas.   The highest recorded point in the country is an unnamed peak stretching 1,910m (6266ft) high near the Jabal Bil Ays in Oman (but within the UAE border). The lowest point is at the Persian Gulf. The country only has 3.8% forest and woodlands due to the arid conditions. In an oasis is it common to find date palms, acacia and eucalyptus trees. Sand storms are common in the UAE, and this can cause traffic on the roads due to the poor visibility. Off the coast of Fujairah the waters are rich in calcium carbonate, and make the ideal breeding ground for coral reefs such as alveopora coral, African pillow coral, brain coral, raspberry-rice coral and more. The marine life in the area is rich due to these diverse coral formations and species in the area include Arabian carpet sharks, areloate groupers, black-finned melon butterfly fish, blacktip reef sharks, parrot fish and even whale sharks, which can be spotted by snorkellers and divers between the months of April and July.",['AE'],1,['ARE']
4004,"It’s generally accepted that the best time to visit Yemen and therefore the ‘high season’ falls between October and April, after the rains and before the intense heat of the summer. However, temperatures, humidity and rainfall all vary radically with altitude. The southern coastal areas see limited rainfall and are hot and humid year round, summer temperatures sometimes topping 54°C (129°F). The central highlands are hot in summer with average temperatures of 30°C (86°F), but winters are cold with frequent frosts. Average rainfall in the central highlands varies from 400mm to 750mm per year. Northern regions, and Wadi Hadhramawt, are hot and dry year round. Summer temperatures hover around the high 30s and it’s not uncommon to find areas where it hasn’t rained for years. That said, Wadi Hadhramawt suffered severe floods in 2008 which threatened to engulf the ancient mud city of Shibam. Lightweight clothes are worn in the coastal plain all year. Warmer clothes are needed from November to April in the highlands. The Republic of Yemen is bordered in the northwest, north and northeast by Saudi Arabia, in the east by Oman and in the south by the Gulf of Aden. To the west lies the Red Sea. The islands of Perim and Karam in the southern Red Sea are also part of the Republic. Yemen is predominantly mountainous, supporting terraced agriculture. The Hadramaut is a range of high mountains in the centre of the country. Highlands rise steeply in central Yemen, ranging in height from approximately 200m (656ft) to the 4,000m (13,123ft) peak of Jabal Nabi Shauib. In contrast is Tihama, a flat semi-desert coastal plain to the west, 50 to 100km (30 to 60 miles) wide. Surface water flows down from the mountains through the valleys during the rainy season and the area is cultivated for cotton and grain. In the east, the mountains drop away to the Rub al-Khali or 'Empty Quarter' of the Arabian Peninsula, a vast sea of sand. The arid coastal plains are fringed with sandy beaches.",['YE'],1,['YEM']

4010,"Belize’s climate is subtropical with a brisk prevailing wind from the Caribbean Sea. Annual temperatures and humidity are high. The temperature stays fairly constant year-round, varying by only about 4°C (7°F) from the hottest times to the coolest. Likewise the humidity remains throughout the year, though the higher you get into the Maya Mountains, the more comfortable the climate becomes. The dry season is from January to April and the rainy season is from mid-May until November. This results in overcast weather despite the heat, so it is not the best time to go for a beach holiday. The hurricane season is from June to the end of November – hurricanes have in the past devastated Belize. January is the coolest month and May is the hottest. Lightweight cottons and linens. A light shell jacket is recommended for the rainy season. Sandals or flip-flops will probably be your most useful footwear, but should you wish to do any hiking in the nature reserves you’ll need proper boots to protect your feet. Swimwear will also be necessary; if you plan to go snorkelling, having a top to wear in the water to protect your back from the sun is a good idea too. For generally being outdoors, a hat and sunglasses are required to prevent sunstroke. Long sleeved shirts and trousers are needed for protection against mosquitoes, which can be ferocious after dusk. Though higher-end places will provide one, it is recommended to take a mosquito net if you’re staying in budget accommodation. Although Belize is a tiny country, it has an astonishing range of geography. The Great Maya Barrier Reef runs alongside Belize's coast creating hundreds of small islands called cayes (keys) and offshore atolls, perfect for diving or snorkelling. From the centre of the country, stretching southwest into Guatemala and southeast to the coast are the Maya Mountains, a tropical broadleaf forest that is home to hundreds of different species. The two most northern districts are Corazol, which is flat terrain eventually turning into the forested hills and wild tropical jungle of Orange Walk. This sector is often referred to as the breadbasket of the country since it's primarily an agricultural area. The Belize district is home to the Northern Cayes. Ambergris Caye is the most developed and elegant resort area in the country while Caye Caulker has a more laid back atmosphere. Both are famous for their diving and snorkelling. Belize City has a mixed geography: to the north are the savannahs, to the west tropical jungle and to the south lagoons and mangroves. Western Cayo district is the largest county and is home to the Maya Mountains. Several rivers drop down from the mountain range, heading south, east and north making this a lush forested area filled with waterfalls, caves and Mayan ruins. The spectacular Hummingbird Highway traverses the northern edge of the mountains. Southern Belize has two distinct areas. Stann Creek rests on the eastern ridge on the Maya Mountain range where there are forested hills and pristine jungle ending at Dangriga on the coast, which gives way to the Central Cayes.",['BZ'],1,['BLZ']
4011,"The southern coast of British Columbia is one of the mildest regions in Canada, with warm summers and relatively mild winters - hence Vancouver Island's coastal rainforests and Victoria's palm trees. Summers in the province's interior are hot. Heavy snowfalls occur in the mountains. Lightweights for most of the summer, with warmer clothes sometimes necessary in the evenings. Mediumweights are worn during winter, with Alpine wear in the mountains. Waterproof clothing is advisable throughout the year. British Columbia is Canada's most westerly province, bordered to the south by the USA (Washington, Idaho and Montana states), to the east by Alberta, to the north by the Northwest Territories and the Yukon, and to the west by the Pacific Ocean and the 'Alaska Panhandle'. It is mainly covered by virgin forests, and encompasses the towering Rocky Mountains (rising to 3,954m/12,972ft), vast expanses of semi-arid sagebrush, lush pastures on Vancouver Island's east coast, farmland in the Fraser River delta, and fruitland in the Okanagan Valley. The highest mountain is Fairweather at 4,663m (15,298ft). Between the eastern and coastal mountains is a lower central range.

The Columbia River flows from the Rockies into Washington State and out into the Pacific Ocean.",['CA'],1,['CAN']
4012,"Summers are very warm, with cool evenings, while the spring and autumn months are mild, with cool evenings. The winter 'rainy season' is gentle and occurs between January and March. Much of the state has a Mediterranean climate, with hot, dry summers and mild, rainy winters. San Francisco is known for its characteristic fog in spring and early summer. Northern California and the high mountains have snow in winter, while the deserts experience very hot summers and mild winters. For the best skiing in Lake Tahoe, the end of January and the beginning of February offer good snow and a break from the swelling crowds at Christmas and through mid-January. For prime sunny beach weather in Southern California, July and August offer lots of sun and heat, but there will be crowds. Avoid the “May Gray” and “June Gloom,” which bring a low-lying marine layer of clouds over the coastline for most of the day. Lightweight during the summer with warmer wear for the cooler winter period. Hiking boots and gear are needed for more adventurous mountain climbing and hiking in Yosemite and parts of Joshua Tree. Skiing in Lake Tahoe is warmer than most mountains, so dress in layers, and don’t be surprised to see skiers show-off in t-shirts. Beachwear is acceptable in restaurants and shops near the beach, but shirts and shoes are required by law. Men should not wear shorts away from the beach. Los Angeles is a fashion-conscious city, especially for women and dressier clothes are required for many nightclubs and restaurants. Men don’t have to wear formal suits, but shirts and trousers are standard. California is a geographically diverse area of the USA. The state is usually divided into Northern and Southern California, though there are isn’t a well defined boundary. San Francisco is a northern city, while San Diego and Los Angeles are southern, but the areas in between aren’t easily defined – rather, the distinction is more between the differing attitudes and lifestyles in different areas, than a physical boundary. Southern California is generally a developed urban environment, with major cities and sprawling suburbs accessible only by car. Northern California is more rugged and natural, with vineyards, mountains, and agricultural regions. California is bordered to the north by Oregon state, to the east by the states of Nevada and Arizona across the Colorado River, to the south by Mexico, and to the west by the Pacific Ocean. Earth scientists have divided the state into eleven distinct mountain ranges, plateaus, deserts, basins, and valleys. The most notable mountains are the Sierra Nevada range which run north-south for 640 km (398 miles) and contain the highest peak in the United States: Mount Whitney. The Mojave Desert contains the lowest and hottest place in America: Death Valley, where the temperatures hover around 49°C (120°F). in mid-summer. Earthquakes are a regular (but rarely deadly) occurrence throughout the state, especially near San Francisco.",['US'],1,['USA']
4013,"If you’re planning on skiing or enjoying winter sports, the best time to visit Canada is between December and April, though some resorts open as early as November and extend their seasons as late as June (or even July on Whistler’s glacier). If you want to enjoy the great outdoors without the snow, travel between May and September. Be aware, however, that if there’s been heavy snowfall during the winter, some high-altitude hiking trails may be closed well into July. Summer thunderstorms are common throughout Canada. Occasionally, these may become severe. Tornados also occur throughout Canada, with May to September being prime months. The tornado-prone areas include most of Alberta, southwestern Quebec, and a band stretching from southern Saskatchewan through to Thunder Bay in Ontario. The interior of British Columbia and western New Brunswick are also tornado zones. Earth tremors occur in the western mountains. Forest fires can occur at any time, regardless of the season, particularly in the grasslands and forests of western Canada. Note: These general guidelines apply mainly to the settled areas of southern Canada. Travellers heading to northern areas, such as the Yukon, the Northwest Territories, Nunavut and Labrador, should bring warm clothing for all but the summer months (and even in summer, at least a lightweight jacket is advisable). See the individual provinces and territories sections for more details. Winter (Dec – Feb): Winter temperatures. Winter clothing is necessary (e.g. overcoat, hat, boots and gloves). Most provinces experience heavy snowfall, with Vancouver being the main exception in that it usually rains instead. Spring (Mar – May): Moderate temperatures. Medium weight clothing with a waterproof topcoat or umbrella is the recommendation. Summer (Jun – Aug): Warm temperatures. Lightweight summer clothing with some medium weight clothing for cool evenings. Autumn/ Fall (Sep – Nov): Cool, with the first frost in the air. Medium to heavyweight clothing is recommended, particularly with the first signs of snow in November. Canada is the second-largest country by total area in the world after Russia, covering an area of 9,984,670 sq km (3,855,100 sq miles). It is bordered to the west by the North Pacific Ocean and Alaska in the northwest, to the east by the Atlantic Ocean, to the north by the Arctic Ocean, to the northeast by Greenland (across the Nares Strait), and to the south by the 'Lower 48' states of the USA.

4016,"Located around 10° north of the Equator, Costa Rica enjoys a tropical climate year-round. Costa Rica’s Pacific coast Divided into North Pacific, Central Pacific and South Pacific regions, this long stretch of coastline attracts many visitors to its sandy beaches and secluded coves. December to March is the best time to visit Costa Rica's Pacific coast, particularly the northern and central parts, as this is the dry season with the most sunshine. As you move further south, the dry season becomes less defined. In other words, there are rainy days even during the dry season. May to October is the wet season along the Pacific Coast, so expect hot and humid weather, which can be uncomfortable to some travellers. April is generally the warmest month, while December is the coolest month. In the coastal town of Puntarenas on the Gulf of Nicoya, the average high ranges from 27-29°C (81-84°F) year-round except in April, when the mercury often climbs above 30°C (86°F). The Osa Peninsula (Peninsula de Osa) on Costa Rica's South Pacific Coast has an average high of 28°C (82°F) throughout the year. The central valley and San José Spanning from San Ramón (Alajuela province) in the west to Paraíso (Cartago province) in the east, Costa Rica's central valley is the setting for the country's capital, San José. Sitting at 1,172m (3,845ft) above sea level, San José has a tropical climate with warm days and cool nights. The best time to visit San José is from January to March when the weather is warm and has little rain. The rain starts from May and lasts till October, with September being the wettest month. April is usually the warmest month with an average high of 30°C (86°F) and an average low is 19°C (66°F). Costa Rica's Caribbean coast Stretching from Barra del Colorado in the north to Sixaola in the south, Costa Rica's Caribbean coast receives heavy rainfall throughout the year with no distinct dry season. Hurricanes may also affect the Caribbean coast, especially in October and November. February, March and September are widely considered to be the best time to visit Costa Rica's Caribbean coast – these are the 'dryer' months, although you may still get fourteen to seventeen rainy days in a month. Limón, or Puerto Limón, is the largest city on the Caribbean coast. It has a tropical rainforest climate with an average high of 30°C (86°F) year-round. In other words, it is hot and humid. Lightweight cottons and linens are fine most of the year, with warmer clothes for cooler evenings. Waterproofing is necessary during the rainy season. Loose-fitting clothing is best. Wear neutral browns and greens for birding and wildlife viewing. Always bring mosquito repellent, along with appropriate footwear for whatever activities you're planning. Check the weather forecast before leaving for your trip. Located on the Central American isthmus, Costa Rica borders the Pacific Ocean to the west, the Caribbean Sea to the east, Nicaragua to the north and Panama to the south. Costa Rica sits along the Pacific Ring of Fire. Volcanoes, both active and dormant, run from the northwest to the central valley and continue onwards to the southeast. The Central Volcanic Mountain Range draws the most visitors, as it features Arenal (which erupts from time to time) and Irazu (the country's highest volcano). About 45km (28mi) west of Irazu is San José, the country's capital. Costa Rica's highest peak is Cerro Chirripó (3,821m or 12,536ft), which is part of the Talamanca Range in the southeast. From the summit, you can see the Caribbean Sea and the Pacific Ocean on a clear day. Along both coastlines, lowlands, wetlands, and miles of sandy beaches backed by dense tropical rainforest are the defining characteristics.",['CR'],1,['CRI']

4018,"El Salvador’s dry season (known locally as verano, or summer) runs between November and April, with a rainy season (invierno or winter) between May and October. In the rainy season, coastal and central regions typically suffer afternoon storms sandwiched between pleasant weather. In terms of temperature, the country’s subtropical climate can be divided into three separate zones, dependent on altitude. Coastal areas are uniformly hot throughout the year, the central plateau shows more extremes of hot and cold (though still rarely dropping below 10 °C) while upland areas have a cooler, more temperate climate. El Salvador is rarely affected by hurricanes, though tropical storm Agatha caused heavy rains and flooding in 2010. For most travellers, it is best to visit during the dry season and to avoid the hottest time of the year (March-April) when humidity levels are particularly high. Surfers, however, should aim for April to October, or March at a push. In August beach and lake resorts are busy with Salvadoran holidaymakers. Lightweight clothing and rainwear during the wet season in coastal areas. Waterproof clothing is advisable all year round. Warm clothing should be taken for higher altitudes. For camping and outdoor countryside activities, aim to cover up as much as possible to avoid potentially dangerous insect and animal bites. El Salvador is situated in Central America between 13° and 14°N. It is bordered north and west by Guatemala, north and east by Honduras, and south and west by the Pacific Ocean. The country is the smallest in Central America and uniquely within the region, it has no Caribbean coastline. North-easterly movement of the offshore Cocos tectonic plate and the westerly movement of El Salvador’s northern neighbours accounts for the frequency of earthquakes and volcanic activity in the country. Most of El Salvador is volcanic uplands, along which run two almost parallel volcanic ranges. The highest volcanoes are Santa Ana at 2,365m (7,759ft), San Vicente at 2,182m (7,159ft) and San Salvador at 1,943m (6,375ft). Volcanic activity has resulted in a thick layer of ash and lava on the highlands, creating a richly mineralised soil, ideal for coffee planting. Lowlands lie to the north and south of the high backbone. On the country’s longest river, the Rio Lempa, the 800m (2,624ft)-wide hydroelectric Cerrón Grande Dam provides power to much of the country and has created a reservoir with capacity of 2,180 million m³. Fed by rivers in Guatemala and Honduras, the Lempa flows in a broadly southern direction spreading into the Bajo Lempa flood plain before draining into the Pacific. Lago De Ilopango is the country’s largest ‘natural’ lake with surface area of 72 sq km (28 sq miles). A scenic crater lake with steeply scalloped banks, it lies just to the east of San Salvador. Of the country’s other lakes, Lago De Coatepeque is the most notable and perhaps most scenic with hot springs an added attraction for visitors. The lake covers 26 sq km (10 sq miles) in the province of Santa Ana, and like Ilopango it has steep high banks. Rising up from Coatepeque’s watery blue crater is Isla Teopán (‘sprouting island’) where important Mayan artefacts have been found.",['SV'],1,['SLV']
4019,"On average, Florida tends to maintain warm temperatures throughout the entire year with slightly lower temperatures during the winter months. Summers are long, warm and particularly humid, lasting from May to October. And the winters throughout the state are quite short and dry, lasting from December to February. In January, the coldest month, the average temperature is 61°F (16°C). In July, the hottest month, the average temperature is 82°F (28°C). The climate in Florida is heavily influenced by the fact that the state is a peninsula, surrounded completely by the sea. Since the sea is able to store heat, the coastal areas tend to maintain s slightly warmer temperature in the winter than the central areas of the state. This also explains why the average temperature of the surrounding sea in Florida is the highest in the month of July (84°F or 29°C), making it one of the best times of the year for swimming. Florida, in particular, also tends to experience a wet and a dry season throughout the year. During the wet season, lasting from May to October, the state tends to experience high levels of humidity followed by heavy, yet brief, thunderstorms on almost a daily basis. In fact, Florida reports more thunderstorms on average than any other US state. The north-western coastal areas are especially prone to instances of heavy rainfall, more than any other area in the state. Thus, those interested in staying in the drier areas should keep to the interior or try the southwestern coastal areas. The wet season also increases the chance of tropical storms and hurricanes, particularly from August to October. During the dry season, in contrast, the state tends to experience low levels of humidity and clear skies, lasting from November to April. However, since the chances of rainfall are significantly less during this period, displays of wildfire do occur, but not on a frequent basis. During the summer months, sunglasses, hats, lightweight cottons and linens are recommended, though air conditioning in many public places can push indoor temperatures down. It does tend to get a bit cooler during the evenings and nights, so light jackets are also recommended. During the winter months, heavier coats may occasionally come in handy in the northern areas, whereas, light coats may be useful in the central and southern parts of the state.  The state of Florida occupies, for the most part, a relatively flat peninsula between the Atlantic Ocean, the Gulf of Mexico and the Florida Straits. At its most distant points, it extends approximately 805 km (500 miles). The states of Alabama and Georgia border Florida to the north, with a portion of Alabama bordering the state at the western tip of the Panhandle. Bimini, one of the islands of the Bahamas, lies a mere 92 km (57 miles) from the city of Miami and Havana, the capital of Cuba, is around 171 km (106 miles) south of Key West. With a total area of 170,304 sq km (65,755 sq miles), Florida ranks 22nd among the 50 states in size. The state boasts 13,576 km (8,436 miles) of coastline, 1,067 km (663 miles) of which are beaches. The St. Johns River is the longest river in the state, running northward for 499 km (310 miles) from the St. Johns Marsh in Indian River County to its outlet with the Atlantic Ocean at Jacksonville. Lake Okeechobee is Florida’s largest freshwater lake measured at 1,891 sq km (730 sq miles), making it the second largest freshwater lake within the contiguous United States. Florida’s highest point, Britton Hill, is situated at 105 m (345 ft) above sea level in the Panhandle, making it the lowest highpoint of any US state. Florida, like most other states, is divided into smaller administrative units called counties. In total, there are 67 counties in the state. Miami-Dade County is the most populated county, according to 2018 census figures, with 2,761,581 residents. Liberty County, in contrast, is the least populated county in the entire state with only 8,457 residents. The largest county, in terms of area, is Palm Beach County (5,268 sq km or 2,034 sq miles) while the smallest is Union County (622 sq km or 240 sq miles). The largest cities in Florida, in terms of population, are Jacksonville, Miami and Tampa, according to 2018 census figures. The largest metropolitan areas by population include Miami-Fort Lauderdale-West Palm Beach, Tampa-St. Petersburg-Clearwater and Orlando-Kissimmee-Sanford.",['US'],1,['USA']

4021,"Greenland has an Arctic climate, but owing to the size of the country there are great variations in the weather. As the climate graph shows, winters can be severe and the summers comparatively mild, particularly in areas which are sheltered from the prevailing winds. Precipitation, mostly snow, is moderately heavy around the coast. The north of the country, and much of the interior, enjoys true Arctic weather, with the temperature only rising above freezing for brief periods in the summer.Conditions in all parts of the country can become hazardous when there is a combination of a low temperature and a strong wind. Local advice concerning weather conditions should be followed very carefully. Nevertheless, the summer months are suitable for a wide range of outdoor activities. Good-quality windproof and waterproof clothes, warm layers and moulded sole shoes at all times of the year; also some slightly thinner clothes - it is important to be able to change clothing during a day's climbing as temperatures can vary greatly during one day. Sunglasses and protective sun lotion are strongly advised. In July and August, mosquitoes can be a problem, especially inside the fjords and so a mosquito net can prove indispensable. Extra warm clothes are necessary for those contemplating dog-sledge expeditions. Extra clothes are not always available for hire in Greenland. Greenland is the world's biggest island. The surrounding seas are either permanently frozen or chilled by cold currents. The inland area is covered with ice, stretching 2,500km (1,500 miles) north-south and 1,000km (600 miles) east-west. In the centre, the ice can be up to 3km (2 miles) thick. The ice-free coastal region, which is sometimes as wide as 200km (120 miles), covers a total of 410,449 sq km (158,475 sq miles), and is where all of the population is to be found. This region is intersected by deep fjords which connect the inland ice area with the sea.",['GL'],1,['GRL']
4022,"Guatemala’s weather is eternally comfortable: neither too hot nor too cold. Its seasons tend to be divided into the dry season and the wet season, although the temperature,which averages 22°C (72°F) across the country, varies more according to altitude than by season. November through to April is the dry season and in the mountainous central region (Guatemala City, Antigua, Lake Atitlan, Chichicastenango, Cobán and the highlands) it is an ideal climate for outdoor pursuits with average temperatures of 18°C (64°F). It also coincides with the festivals of Semana Santa, Day of the Dead, the Burning of the Devil and the Saint Thomas festival in Chichicastenango. The rainy season runs from May to October which can hinder travel in more remote areas where roads are not well maintained, with Petén receiving the most amount of rainfall. In higher climes, near the centre of the country, the rainy season, running from May to September, is characterised by clear skies after abundant rainfall in the afternoons and evenings. This means that travel during this time can be extremely pleasant, with less crowds and cooler temperatures. Temperatures can fall sharply at night. The coastal regions and the northeast are hot throughout the year with an average temperature of 20°C (68°F) sometimes rising to as much as 37°C (99°F), although the Pacific coast has more unpredictable weather and rain is possible year round. The busiest time of the year for tourism is between December and May when the dry season and festivals mean that much of the accommodation can be booked long in advance (especially in Antigua during Semana Santa). This is also a popular time for language learning and many North Americans come to study in the schools in towns such as Antigua and Xela. Lightweight clothing. Jacket or light woollens for the evening. Waterproof jacket during rainy season. Hiking boots for outdoor activities. Guatemala is the third largest country in Central America and shares borders to the north and west with Mexico, to the southeast with El Salvador and Honduras, to the northeast with Belize and the Caribbean Sea, and to the south with the Pacific Ocean. The landscape is predominantly mountainous and heavily forested, with narrow coastal plains and tropical, humid lowlands blanketed in rainforests, coffee and banana plantations. A string of volcanoes rises above the southern highlands along the Pacific, four of which are still active. Within this volcanic area are basins of varying sizes which hold the majority of the country's population. The region is drained by rivers flowing into both the Pacific and the Caribbean; however one basin west of the capital has no river outlet and thus has formed Lake Atitlán, which is ringed by volcanoes. To the northwest, bordering on Belize and Mexico, lies the low undulating tableland of El Petén, 36,300 sq km (14,000 sq miles) of almost inaccessible wilderness covered with dense hardwood forest.

4024,"The climate is tropical with cooler, more temperate weather in the mountains with temperatures ranging from 16°C (61°F) to 20°C (68°F). The north coast is very hot with rain throughout the year, and though the offshore breezes temper the climate, the sun is very strong. The dry season is from November to April and the wet season runs from May to October. Despite their proximity to the mainland the Bay Islands have a slightly different, subtropical climate. The temperatures along the Caribbean coast and island range from 24°C (75°F) to 34°C (93°F) and, in contrast to the mainland, the rainy season in the Bay Islands is from July to January, with the rainiest months being October through early January. The remainder of the year is usually very dry. The southern Pacific Coast tends to be hot and dry with temperatures between 28° (82°F) to 32°C (90°F). The Caribbean hurricane season is between June and November and although the Bay Islands and Caribbean coast of Honduras are outside the typical hurricane path, they do often receive the tail end of tropical storms or hurricanes during this time. The main high season in Honduras is between January and June, although this extends to September for the Bay Islands. The intense rainy season can hinder much travel, and roads are often blocked due to rock slides and flooding. Activities such as kayaking and white water rafting are best done after the height of the rainy season, and while scuba diving centres in the Bay Islands are open year-round, the high season is in the dry season. Whale shark sightings off the islands can be done year-round but chances are higher in March and April. Semana Santa is the busiest time of the year for the islands and accommodation should be booked long in advance. In La Moskitia region, the drier seasons of February to May and August to November are the best for travel. Lightweight cottons and linens; warmer clothes are recommended between November and February and in the mountains. Waterproofs are needed for the wet season. Honduras shares borders in the southeast with Nicaragua, in the west with Guatemala, and in the southwest with El Salvador. To the north lies the Caribbean, with which it has 669 km (416 miles) of coastline and to the south, the Pacific Ocean. The interior of the country comprises a central mountain system running from east to west, cut by rivers flowing into both the Caribbean and Pacific. The lowlands in the south form a plain along the Pacific coast, while the highest point in the country is Cerro Las Minas at 2,870m (9,416 ft) above sea level. The Gulf of Fonseca in the southwest contains many islands which have volcanic peaks. The large fertile valleys of the northern Caribbean lowlands are cultivated with banana plantations. However, large areas of land in Honduras are unsuitable for cultivation. The majority of the population lives in the western half of the country, while the second-largest concentration of people is in the Cortés area which extends northwards from Lake Yojoa towards the Caribbean. Along the Caribbean shore is the virtually uninhabited La Moskitia Coast. The Bay Islands, which consist of Roatan, Utila and Guanaja (along with Cayos Cochinos) are located to the north of the country, a few miles off the coast of La Ceiba. They are low-lying islands, surrounded by many cays, and are part of the Mesoamerican Barrier Reef.",['HN'],1,['HND']

4036,"Mexico is a great destination to visit throughout the year. Altitude is a determining factor with regards to the weather, with cooler temperatures at higher elevations (Mexico City, Puebla, San Cristóbal de las Casas) and warmer, tropical weather as you descend to sea level (Guadalajara, Cuernavaca, Cancun). Along the Pacific and Caribbean coasts, the winter months (November-February) are warm and sunny. Many Europeans visit during this time to escape winter in their homelands. The summer months (June-August), meanwhile, are very hot and humid with heavy rain showers and the occasional hurricane. October and November are perhaps the best months to visit the interior, after the rains have ended and everything is still green. This varies from area to area. Natural fibres are best in the heat, but have a sweater on hand as the nights are generally cooler. A sun hat will help to avoid dehydration. In the mountains, heavier clothing will be required. Mexico is at the southern extremity of North America and is bordered to the north by the USA, northwest by the Gulf of California, west by the Pacific, south by Guatemala and Belize, and east by the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean.

4048,"New York is warm and sunny from May to October, followed by cold winters. Snow is common in the mountains and interior part of the state. Buffalo gets more snow than Anchorage, Alaska due to the lake effect from Lake Erie. Summer in New York City can be hot and humid, with occasional tropical storms. Due to vehicular emissions, the city often issues ozone alert days during summer months. Fall is a popular time to visit New York, as the leaves on trees turn brilliant shades of red, yellow and orange, and temperatures tend to be very comfortable. “Leaf peeping” is a popular autumn activity among locals and visitors alike. Winters are usually cold, with occasional snowstorms, freezing rain and bitter cold winds, which blow off both the Hudson and the East Rivers. The winter conditions outside the city often mean liberal snow for skiers. Due to variable weather conditions, visitors should pack clothing that allows for layering. Lightweight cottons and linens are advised for summer months, while heavyweight clothing with extra bundling are advised for the winter. Visitors planning on engaging in outdoor activities, regardless of the time of year, should be sure to pack relevant specialty clothing. Keep in mind that the water in the Atlantic Ocean never gets particularly warm, so those planning on surfing at popular points such as Montauk should plan on wearing a full wet suit. New York State may not be among the largest states in the US, but it is geographically diverse, with mountains, forests, valleys, lakes, and oceans creating diverse landscapes and microclimates. Though many visitors' perceptions of New York may be of a bustling, vibrant hyper-urban tableau, the majority of the state is actually quite pastoral, and both residents and politicians tend to support land preservation initiatives. New York State borders six other states, one country (Canada), and two of the nation's Great Lakes, as well as the Atlantic Ocean. Recently, concerns have arisen about modern geological activity, especially seismic activity. A 2011 earthquake felt in New York caused residents to become more interested in learning about the state's fault lines, and concerns about climate change have precipitated conversations about flood zones and long-term infrastructure planning, especially in New York City. The state features several mountain ranges, including the Catskills and the Adirondacks, whose geographical attributes are largely responsible for attracting so many visitors who love the outdoors. Though rivers are an important feature of the state's geography, particularly in New York, which is hemmed in by the Hudson River on its west side and the East River on its east side, the state is perhaps even better known for its lakes, the number of which have given rise to the name of an entire region: the Thousand Lakes. Of course, there is also the Atlantic Ocean, which is certainly one of the main attractions for visitors to Long Island. The area now known as New York state was once glacial, which is why modern visitors can enjoy Niagara Falls, the result of glacial melt.",['US'],1,['USA']

4050,"The climate in Nicaragua differs according to region, so the best time to go varies. The climate is tropical for almost the entire country and is therefore hot all year round, with temperatures averaging approximately 27ºC (81ºF) all year. In lower lying areas temperatures can range from 22ºC (72ºF) to 30ºC (86ºF), whilst in the mountains it is typically cooler; hovering between 12ºC (53ºF) and 20ºC (68ºF). Most tourists visit Nicaragua during the dry season, which runs from December to May. The rainy season generally lasts from June to November, however nearer to the Pacific it runs from May to November. The climate on the Atlantic northwestern side of Nicaragua can be very temperamental and receives the highest volume of rainfall in the country on average. Granada The temperature in Granada varies little throughout the year, with the average high a balmy 32ºC (90ºF) and the average low a temperate 23ºC (74ºF). The best time to visit is in the dry season from early December to late March, when there is enough wind and breeze to cool the abrasive tropical heat. León Like much of Nicaragua, León is hot year round, and generally fluctuates between highs of 34ºC (94ºF) and lows of 23ºC (74ºF). Visiting León can be done year-round, however it’s recommended to visit during peak tourist season, particularly towards the start of the New Year. With high levels of humidity, as is typical of tropical Nicaragua, you’ll want to pack summer clothing and waterproofs too. San Juan del Sur A paradise for surfers and sunbathers, San Juan is perhaps where you’ll find Nicaragua at its most clement. With easy access to a number of beaches, the breeze here mitigates the searing heat of Nicaragua like no other, meaning you’ll be comfortable year-round. Managua The most built up of Nicaragua’s main cities, the capital experiences searing heat and humidity during the dry season and an abundance of tropical rain and grey skies during the wet season. With less trees and natural resources around in this metropolis, it’s harder to escape the full force of the elements, so planning accordingly is advised. The peak tourist season in Nicaragua is between December and March, so anyone wanting to avoid the crowds should consider travelling during the shoulder season months of May and November. Lightweight cottons and linens are required throughout the year – bring shorts, t-shirts, and beach wear if you’ll be visiting coastal regions. Waterproofs are advisable during the rainy season. Warmer clothes are recommended when visiting the northern mountains; think woolly knits and layers that allow you to wrap up warm as the temperature drops. Nicaragua is the largest country in Central America, bordering Honduras to the north and Costa Rica to the south. To the east lies the Caribbean, and to the west the Pacific. In the north are the Isabella Mountains, while the country's main feature in the southwest is Lake Nicaragua which is about 160km (99 miles) long and about 72km (44 miles) at its widest. The island of Ometepe is the largest of the hundreds of islands on the lake. These islands have a reputation for great beauty and are one of the country's main tourist attractions. Lake Managua is situated northwest of Lake Nicaragua. Volcanoes, including the famous Momotombo, protrude from the surrounding lowlands northwest of the lakes. The country's main rivers are the San Juan, the lower reaches of which form the border with Costa Rica, and the Rio Grande de Matagalpa.

The rainy season lasts from May to November, but even at this time of year rain rarely lasts all day – just take an umbrella for the downpours; the sun will be out again soon. There are fewer people around at this time, too, and so prices drop for the low season. Rainfall is twice as heavy on the Pacific coast as it is on the lowlands of the Caribbean coast. If you are planning to take a boat trip from Panama to >Colombia, avoid travelling from December to February, as at this time of year the seas are rough, trips get cancelled and everyone gets seasick. Surfing is possible and decent all year round on the Pacific side, but the best months are from November to April. For hiking, the dry season (December to April) is most comfortable. The dry season is also good for diving, because you’ll be able to see far better, but the rainy season means the rivers run high which is great for rafting. Lightweight cottons and linens are worn, with rainwear advisable, particularly in the rainy season. However, keep it light: just because it rains doesn’t mean it gets cold. Warmer clothes are needed in the highlands, especially in the dry season. If hiking and camping at a higher altitude, things can get very chilly indeed – make sure your sleeping bag can handle it. Hiking boots are great for the mountains, but most of the time you’ll be in flip-flops. Forget your mosquito repellent at your peril, and a mosquito net might come in handy too. Panama forms the land link between the North and South American continents. It borders Colombia to the east, Costa Rica to the west, and the Caribbean and the Pacific Ocean to the north and south.

4070,"The United States has varied weather conditions, and the best time to visit depends both upon the location and the season. Spring (March- May) and autumn (September-November) are generally cooler, more comfortable times to visit. The summer months (June-August) are generally hot regardless of the region, but winter temperatures (December-February) can vary substantially depending upon the part of the US you are visiting. The southern part of the country tends to be warmer than the north. The general climate of the continental US is temperate, but keep in mind that Hawaii is tropical and Alaska is arctic. Many of the country's dependent territories, such as Guam, Puerto Rico, and the US Virgin Islands, are also tropical. Summer is considered the peak tourist season throughout the country; other popular travel times are major American holidays, especially Thanksgiving and Christmas, as well as Easter Week and the school holiday known as Spring Break. Certain destinations, such as New York, are perennial favourites and are busy year-round; even when the weather may not be pleasant, these destinations have particular attractions or experiences that always draw travellers. In some parts of the country, travel services may be limited during the low or off-season, largely due to weather conditions. As the US is a vast country with varying climates and four distinct seasons, packing clothing that allows you to layer for warmer and cooler conditions is recommended, especially if you plan to travel to different regions of the country. What you pack will largely depend upon the kinds of activities you plan to enjoy. Outdoor-lovers will need clothing and shoes that are appropriate for the terrain and the activities they have planned; visitors to cities will need a range of casual outfits and perhaps one smarter outfit for a night of fine dining or theatre. Covering a large part of the North American continent, the USA shares borders with Canada to the north and Mexico to the south. The country has coasts on the Atlantic, Pacific and Arctic oceans, the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico. The State of Alaska, in the northwest corner of the US, is not part of the continental US; it is separated from the rest of the USA by Canada. Similarly, Hawaii is not part of the 'lower 48' states; it lies in the central Pacific Ocean. The country's dependent territories are offshore and have distinct geographies of their own; the majority are islands. The third-largest country in the world (after the Russian Federation and Canada), the USA has an enormous diversity of geographical features, including mountains, plains, and coastal zones. Though there are many cities that are densely populated with more manmade features than natural ones, there are also vast rural areas that are far more sparsely populated. The climate ranges from subtropical to arctic, with a corresponding breadth of flora and fauna.

There are two climatic zones: the tropical zone (in the north above the Tropic of Capricorn) and the temperate zone. The tropical zone (consisting of 40% of Australia) has two seasons, summer ('wet') and winter ('dry'), while the temperate zone has all four seasons. Spring to summer (October to March): Warm or hot everywhere, tropical in the north, and warm to hot with mild nights in the south. This is the classic tourist season, with northern hemisphere visitors looking to escape winter temperatures and soak up some Antipodean sunshine, although Australia is essentially a year-round destination. Autumn to winter (April to September): Northern and central Australia have clear warm days and cool nights; the south has cool days with occasional rain but still plenty of sun. Snow is totally confined to mountainous regions of the southeast. At certain times, the southern part of the mainland (as well as Tasmania) can become seriously chilly, so be prepared to wrap up.

Should you arrive in the country without the appropriate clothing or equipment, however, it’s generally no problem to find high-quality items to purchase – there’s no danger of being left to choose from a substandard selection. Australia's great coastline covers 59,736km (37,119 miles); the country is lapped by the Arafura and Timor Seas to the north, the Coral and Tasman Seas of the South Pacific to the east, the Southern Ocean to the south, and the Indian Ocean to the west. Most of the population has settled along the eastern and southeastern coastal strip, with the notable exception of Perth, one of the most remote cities in the world, on the west coast. Australia is the smallest continent (and the largest island) in the world, and terrain ranges from baking red desert to lush green rainforest, and from world-renowned surfing beaches to snow-clad mountains.  It’s partly the extreme diversity of different landscapes that makes Australia such a great travel proposition, in fact – there aren’t many countries that can offer natural features as richly eclectic as Uluru, the Great Ocean Road and the Great Barrier Reef. In the east lies the Great Dividing Range; there are rainforests in the far northeast (mainly in Queensland); the southeast is a huge fertile plain; and further to the north lays the enormous Great Barrier Reef: a 2,000km (1,200-mile) strip of coral that covers a total area of 345,000 sq km (133,000 sq miles).",['AU'],1,['AUS']

4094,"Covers 1,349,129 square kilometres (520,902 square miles), the Northern Territory has two distinct climates – tropical and rainforest in the northern half and semi-arid desert in the southern half. Darwin, the capital, sits by the Timor Sea and experiences a tropical climate with average highs staying pretty consistent from 29°C (84°F) to 32°C (90°F) year-round. It has two distinct wet and dry seasons. • The wet season in Darwin: October to April is the wet season with majority of the rainfall occurs between December and March - it is safe to expect 18 to 22 rainy days a month during this period. In January, the average high is 31°C (88°F) and the average low is 26°C (79°F), while the average rainfall is 420mm (17 inches), making January the wettest month. • The dry season in Darwin: May to September is the dry season – as Darwin sizzles in sunshine, this is the best time to visit Darwin. In July, the average high is 29°C (84°F) and the average low is 22°C (72°F), while the average rainfall is just 10mm (0.4 inches). Located just south of the Tropic of Capricorn, Alice Springs has a desert climate with temperatures vary widely. Although the annual average high is 29°C (84°F), temperatures over 44°C (111°F) have been frequently recorded from October to February. The best time to visit Alice Springs is from June to August when average highs dip to 21°C (70°F) – but bring a jacket as night time temperatures can fall below freezing. Rainfall, despite little, mostly occurs between November and March. Lightweight cottons and linens most of the year. Waterproofing is necessary in the northern areas during the rainy season. A warm sweater or jacket is advised for Alice Springs and the sourthern region from June to August as night time temperatures can drop to below freezing.  A wilderness stretching roughly 1,670km (1,038 miles) from Darwin and Kakadu in the north to Uluru (Ayers Rock) in the south and 1,000km (620 miles) east to west, the Northern Territory comprises nearly one-sixth of Australian mainland. It is roughly the size of France, Spain and Italy combined. Due to its size, it is common to hear people use the phrases ‘Top End’ and ‘Red Centre’ when referring to a chunk of geographical region within the Territory. Here is a summary: The Top End: The Top End is referred to the geographical area covering Darwin the capital of the Northern Territory, UNESCO-listed Kakadu National Park, Arnhem Land (an area of vast flood plains and rocky escarpments steeped in natural and cultural heritage, as it is said that Aboriginal people have lived here for at least 35,000 years) and the Katherine area. The Red Centre: The Red Centre is centred around Alice Springs, which is almost at the geographical centre of Australia and the starting point of many of the Red Centre's unique and natural wonders, including Uluru (Ayers Rock).",['AU'],1,['AUS']
4095,"With 2,000 islands spread over 7.8 million sq km (3 million sq miles) of the Pacific Ocean, the islands have a variety of weather. The period from November to April is the wet season, when humidity is highest, while cooler and less humid period from May to October is the most pleasant time to visit. The climate can generally be described as tropical in this part of the world, but the cooling sea breezes prevent really extreme temperatures and humidity. For regional climate charts, see under the individual sections. Lightweight cottons and linens, and rainwear. Each archipelago is composed of hundreds of island groups, within which there are many islands varying widely in topography. A more detailed description is given under the individual section for each country. There are three distinct population groups: Malayans who passed through Indonesia and The Philippines; Melanesians coming from the islands of the southwest Pacific; and Polynesians who inhabited the South Pacific.",['FM'],1,['FSM']
4096,"Being so close to the equator, Palau enjoys a steady warm climate all year round with an annual average temperature of 30°C (86°F). Dry season runs from November to April with maximum temperatures of around 32°C (90°F) and lows of 27°C (81°F). Humidity is high all year round. Rainy season falls between July and October, and thunderstorms are quite common but typhoons, when it can rain for days at a time, are fairly rare, as the islands are too close to the equator to be in the hurricane corridor. For divers, the best time to go to Palau is during the dry season, from September to May, when calmer seas mean it's easier for boats to get to particular areas. Manta rays can be seen all year round, but to see the sharks you'll need to visit in March. Palau's temperate climate means that for the majority of trips, not much more than lightweight cottons, linens and beachwear will be needed. Keep a jumper on you for the evenings and if you're venturing inland. If you're planning to do some outdoor activities – hiking, kayaking, etc – then be sure to take the specialist equipment that you'll need. Rain is possible all year round so don't go without packing some sort of light rainwear – a good quality waterproof jacket may be sufficient. The stunning islands of Palau lie 1,000km (600 miles) east of the Philippines in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. Strung out like emeralds in a necklace, the archipelago stretches over 650km (400 miles) from the atoll of Kayangel in the north to the islet of Tobi in the south. The eight main islands which are inhabited make up the bulk of Palau, but the archipelago includes more than 200 islands, and it is part of the larger Caroline Islands chain which also includes the Federated States of Micronesia. With three exceptions, all of the islands are located within a single barrier reef and represent two geological formations. The largest are volcanic and rugged with interior jungle and large areas of grassed terraces. The Rock Islands, now known as the Floating Garden Islands, are of limestone formation, while Kayangel, at the northernmost tip, is a classic coral atoll.",['FM'],1,['FSM']
4097,"Hot, tropical climate at sea level, cooling towards the highlands which also cause climatic variation from one area to another, affecting the southeast trade winds and the northwest monsoons. The majority of the rain falls between December and March due to the northwest monsoon, although Port Moresby enjoys a dry season at this time. There is frost and there are occasional snow falls on the highest mountain peaks. Tropical, lightweights and cottons are recommended. In the highlands,warmer clothing is needed. Rainwear is advised for the monsoon season(December to March). Papua New Guinea consists of over 600 islands and lies in the middle of the long chain of islands stretching from mainland South-East Asia. It lies in the South Pacific, 160km (100 miles) north of Australia. The country occupies the eastern half of the second-largest non-continental island in the world, as well as the smaller islands of the Bismarck Archipelago (Admiralty Island, Bougainville, New Britain and New Ireland), the D'Entrecasteaux Island group and the three islands of the Louisiade Archipelago. The main island shares a land border with Irian Jaya, a province of Indonesia. The mainland and larger islands are mountainous and rugged, divided by large fertile upland valleys. Fast-flowing rivers from the highlands descend to the coastal plains. A line of active volcanoes stretches along the north coast of the mainland and continues on the island of New Britain. To the north and south of this central mountain range on the main island lie vast stretches of mangrove swamps and coastal river deltas.",['PG'],1,['PNG']
4098,"Queensland straddles the Tropic of Capricorn, which accounts for the pleasant climate throughout most of the region. Exceptions are the far north, which is tropical and has a wet and dry season, and the arid western outback, which is fiery hot in summer. Brisbane enjoys an average of 8.2 hours of sunshine daily in the winter. The period between November to April is generally humid throughout the state, but sea breezes temper the humidity and make for perfect holiday conditions. Typically, the low season runs from December to March, during which the part season on the Gold Coast takes off. However, hotels and hostels are typically quieter and cheaper, offering the same warmth as the summer months. It is extremely important, however, to realise that swimming is unsafe from November to May when the shorelines become home to the migrating box jellyfish. Ocean baths that line the beaches are safe alternatives. High season typically runs from June to September with a fine and mild climate, that benefits visibility on the Great Barrier Reef. Lightweight cottons and linens year-round. Waterproofing is advisable in the wet season in the tropical north. Insect repellent and sun cream are essential in all areas of Queensland. Seven times the size of the UK, Queensland is known as the 'Sunshine State', priding itself on an average of around 300 days of sunshine a year. Within its borders lies the Great Barrier Reef, miles of golden sandy beaches, national park forests, vast plains, lush rainforests, forested mountains and extensive wilderness areas. The coastal plains of the north reach out to the Gulf of Carpentaria. East of the Great Dividing Range there are a range of offshore islands which comprise the Great Barrier Reef and other coral formations such as the Whitsunday Islands. Tropical islands and national parks lie north of Brisbane while the Gold Coast reaches south. Further inland, the ochre-red outback beckons, with former copper and uranium mining towns on the route west to Mt Isa.",['AU'],1,['AUS']

The north of the state is searingly hot during the day in summer and freezing at night. One of the hottest places in the area is Coober Pedy, 863km (536 miles) northwest of Adelaide, reaching temperatures of up to 50°C (122°F). Lightweight cottons and linens in summer, warmer mediumweights in winter. Waterproofing is advisable throughout most of the year, particularly during May, June and July. Except for the state capital of Adelaide, South Australia is sparsely inhabited. It is four times the area of the UK. It is the country's driest state, a region of rocky plains and desert landscape broken by the fertile wine-growing areas, which include the Barossa Valley. South Australia stretches upwards to the Northern Territory, eastwards to Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria, and westwards to Western Australia. The countryside ranges from the beach resorts of the Adelaide suburbs including Henley and Glenelg to the vast expanses of isolated, semi-desert outback; from the craggy mountains of Flinders Ranges to the meandering Murray River. Offshore is the popular Kangaroo Island. Adelaide nestles in the foothills of Mount Lofty Ranges.",['AU'],1,['AUS']

Roughly heart-shaped, Tasmania is 296km (184 miles) long, ranging from 315km (196 miles) wide in the north to 70km (44 miles) in the south. The diverse landscape is comprised of rugged mountains (snow-capped in winter), dense bushland (including the Horizontal Forest, so-called because the tree trunks are bent over parallel to the ground), tranquil countryside and farmland. Approximately 40% of Tasmania is protected in national parks and other reserves, over half of this being the World Heritage-listed temperate wilderness in the west of the island.",['AU'],1,['AUS']
4103,"Tonga's climate is marginally cooler than most tropical areas. The best time to visit is from May to November. Heavy rains occur from December to March. Tonga is an archipelago of 176 islands in the South Pacific - most of which are uninhabited - covering an area of 7,700 sq km (3,000 sq miles). The major island groups are 'Eua, Ha'apai, the Niuas, Tongatapu and Vava'u. Tonga's high volcanic and low coral forms give the islands a unique character. Some volcanoes are still active and Falcon Island in the Vava'u group is a submerged volcano that erupts periodically, its lava and ash rising above sea level forming a visible island which disappears when the eruption is over. Nuku'alofa, on Tongatapu Island, has a reef-protected harbour lined with palms. The island is flat with a large lagoon, but no running streams, and many surrounding smaller islands. 'Eua Island is hilly and forested with high cliffs and beautiful beaches. The Ha'apai Islands, a curving archipelago 160km (100 miles) north of Tongatapu, have excellent beaches. Tofua, the largest island in the group, is an active volcano with a hot steaming lake in its crater. The Vava'u Islands, 90km (50 miles) north of Ha'apai, are hilly, densely wooded and interspersed with a maze of narrow channels. They are known for their stalagmite-filled caves.",['TO'],1,['TON']

Winter is from April to October with the temperature averaging 23°C. Sea temperature varies from 22 to 28 degrees making swimming enjoyable all year round. Rainfall is moderate and cyclones are possible, usually between December and April every couple of years. Casual, light clothing year round with perhaps a light sweater or jacket in the winter months. Outside resorts women should dress modestly. A sarong can be handy. Vanuatu is in the heart of Melanesia, with Papua New Guinea and Solomon Islands to the north, Fiji to the east and New Caledonia to the southeast. The Vanuatu Archipelago is a Y-shaped 1,300km (808 miles) and long chain of four main islands and 79 smaller islands, of which 68 are inhabited. The islands themselves are mostly mountains of volcanic origin (several of the islands still have active volcanoes) with narrow coastal plains and have a combined area of 12,200 sq km (7,581 miles) and a combined coastline length of 2,528km (1,571 miles). The Ambrym and Lopevi volcanoes are permanently active and highly dangerous. Lopevi was extinct for many years but became active 50 years ago. Further to the south, on the island of Tanna, is Yasur, cited as the most accessible active volcano in the world and a major tourist attraction.

Lightweight cottons and linens in summer, warmer mediumweights in winter. Waterproofing is advisable in the wet season in the tropical north. Western Australia is larger than Western Europe. It has a relatively small population but is growing at its fastest rate in history. Demographers expect the population of Perth to jump to 2.1 million by 2021. It is bordered on the east by South Australia and the Northern Territory and in the west by the Indian Ocean, with the Timor Sea to the north. The west coast is nearer to Bali and Indonesia than to Sydney, making Perth a viable stopover destination en route to the rest of Australia. There are vast wheatlands, forests and deserts, and several national parks. Kimberley, in the far north, is one of the oldest geological areas on earth; time and weather have formed deep gorges and impressive mountains, arid red plains and coastal sandstone rich in fossils. In the northwest, Wolf Creek Crater, is an immense hole left in the desert by a giant meteorite 50,000 years ago, while Bungle Bungles is an ancient sandstone massif covering 3,000 sq km (1,160 sq miles). Southeast of Perth, near Hyden, is the 2,700-million-year-old Wave Rock.",['AU'],1,['AUS']
4108,"Argentina's climate ranges from the great heat and extensive rains of the subtropical Chaco in the north, through to the pleasant climate of the central Pampas, and the sub-Antarctic cold of the Patagonian Sea in the south. The main central area is temperate, but can be very hot and humid during summer (December to February) and chilly in winter. The most pleasant times to visit Buenos Aires are September-November and February- March. The city is best avoided in January, when the heat is at its most intense and many of its residents flee to the coast leaving behind a comparative ghost city. Exploring the wilds of Patagonia is best done in the late spring and summer months – between November and February – whilst the northern regions are at their most hospitable in the spring, autumn and winter. If heading to Argentina for a ski trip, hit the slopes during mid-June to October. Lightweight clothing is generally all that is required in the north, whereas warm clothes are certainly necessary in the south, up in the mountains and during winter months in the central area. It is sensible to carry waterproofs in all areas and bring a good sunblock. Argentina is the second largest area of land in South America, separated from Chile to the west by the long spine of the Andes. Its landscape is extremely varied, with the top sub-tropical and sun-baked, and its sub-Antarctic bottom tip glistening with icy waters and glaciers. It has 3,100 miles (4,989km) of coastline. Its eastern border is the Atlantic Ocean, with Uruguay, Bolivia, Paraguay and Brazil to the north and northeast. Argentina can roughly be divided into four main geographical areas: the spectacular Andes mountain range, the dry North along with the more verdant Mesopotamia, the lush plains of the Pampas and the windswept wastes of Patagonia. Mount Aconcagua soars almost 7,000m (23,000ft), and waterfalls at Iguazú stretch out in a massive semi-circle, thundering 70m (230ft) to the bed of the Paraná River. Argentina’s lowest point is Laguna del Carbón in Santa Cruz Province, sitting 105m (344ft) below sea level. In the southwest is the Argentine Lake District with a string of beautiful glacial lakes framed by snow-covered mountains. At Argentina’s southernmost tip, and so the southernmost tip of the whole of South America, is Tierra del Fuego (Spanish for Land of Fire), a stunning archipelago split between Argentina and neighbouring Chile.",['AR'],1,['ARG']
4109,"Bolivia has a temperate climate but temperatures can differ dramatically between day and night. The wettest period is November to March, which, in extreme circumstances, may induce landslides in mountainous areas, and cause certain roads to become impassable. The northeast slopes of the Andes are semi-tropical. During the wet season the salt flats become flooded – it is a beautiful spectacle, as the flats turn into a mirror of the sky above. Winter is perhaps the best time to visit (May-October), especially in the hot and humid lowlands, as it is cooler and drier. In the highlands, it rains much less, remains sunny through the day but gets noticeably colder at night. Visitors sometimes find the highlands (especially La Paz) uncomfortable because of the thin air due to high altitude. The mountain areas can become very cold at night. In terms of clothing, lightweight, natural fabrics and waterproofs are best. Layering is a good idea if taking the tour of the salt flats – it's extremely cold at night and early mornings, but when the sun comes out it warms up quickly. Warmer clothing is necessary at night in the Altiplano, especially in La Paz, Oruro and Potosí. If you need warm clothing, the markets of La Paz and Sucre are a good place to find alpaca wool jumpers and scarves. Landlocked by countries (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Paraguay and Peru), Bolivia is a topological pick and mix of spectacular sights, and remains one of the most bio-diverse countries in the world, despite not having a coast. The geography is largely split into the Andean Altiplano and the Eastern lowlands, and the contrast between them could not be greater. In the West, the parallel mountain chains of the Andes dominate. There’s everything from deserts strewn with cacti and soaring rock formations, to magical coloured lakes and the world’s largest salt flat, which contains 10 billion tonnes of salt (the remnants of Lake Minchin which evaporated some 25,000 years ago). You can see llama, alpaca, vicuñas (rabbit-like animals), puma, and the only bear species in South America at these heights. On top of that, expect volcanic geysers at over 4000m (13,000ft) above sea level, the world’s highest lake and the world’s highest capital, La Paz, which sits in a mountain valley with the looming Mount Illimani looking over. The high altitude can take its toll on travellers, so come prepared. Eastern Bolivia is like a completely different world. The Amazon offers all types of flora and fauna, from over 30 monkey species and giant armadillos to catfish, piranha and pink freshwater dolphins. Visit Rurrenabaque to take tours of the Río Tuichi, the Parque Nacional Madidi and the Pampas del Yacuma. The green tropical lowlands of Santa Cruz offer tropical cloudforest – try the Parque Nacional Amboró for lush beauty. The Pantanal, on Bolivia’s eastern border with Brazil is the world’s largest wetland. Over 200,000 sq km (77,000 sq miles) of ecosystems live here, including swamps, lakes, flooded freshwater grasslands and forest. It is here that you will also find the highest concentration of fauna in all the Americas – birds, anacondas and giant otters to name a just a few.",['BO'],1,['BOL']
4110,"Brazil is a big country, covering 8.5 million square kilometres (3.2 million square miles) and its climate varies considerably from north to south, although it should be said that a large part of Brazil (roughly 60%) lies in the tropics. In general, Brazil is a year-round destination with temperatures rarely dip below 20°C (68°F), apart from in the mountains and southern regions. The climate varies from hot and dry in the arid interior to humid and sticky in the tropical rainforests of the Amazon jungle. Belém is the capital and largest city of the state of Pará in the country's north, as well as the gateway to the River Amazon. Belém has a tropical rainforest climate with daily mean stands at a toasty 26°C (79°F) throughout the year. The city also receives a fair amount of rain (60mm on the average) all year round. São Paulo, situated in South-eastern Brazil, is the country's the most populous city. São Paulo has a humid subtropical climate with indistinct four seasons. January is the hottest and also the wettest month, with an average temperature of 25°C (76°F) and 170mm of rainfall. On the contrary, June is the coldest month although temperatures still averaging at a comfortable 19°C (66°F). Rio de Janeiro is about 440km (273 miles) east of São Paulo but has a different climate classification. Rio's summer (December to February) can be very hot with temperatures reaching 40°C (104°F), plus the city also receives abundant rainfall. The hot and wet weather doesn’t stop millions of tourists coming to Rio de Janeiro in January or February for the annual Carnival though. Rio's winter (July and August) is still fairly warm with temperatures averaging 21°C (70°F), making it an ideal time to visit. For more information, see this weather in Rio de Janeiro guide. Curitiba is the capital and largest city of the Brazilian state of Paraná. Located 478km (297 miles) south of São Paulo, Curitiba is in the south region and has a subtropical highland climate with cold fronts bringing rains in summer (December to February) and cold winds in winter (June to August). February is the hottest month, averaging 22°C (72°F) while the average temperature drops to around 15°C (59°F) in June. Also note that parts of the south region, particularly the plateau region, it can get near 0°C (32°F) in winter. As the weather is generally on the warmer side, bring clothes made from lightweight natural fabrics such as cottons and linens which you can layer up. Waterproofs are a must if visiting during the rainy season, or places like Belém where it receives a substantial amount of rain year around. Bring warm clothing if visiting the south during winter (June to August). On the other hand, the extremely humid climate of the Amazon region demands quick-dry shirts and long cotton pants for any treks or activity tourism. Sunlight around the tropics is extremely strong, so take a wide-brimmed hat and a pair of sunglasses. Long-sleeve cotton shirts are also useful in the jungle; they protect you from mosquito bites and the sun. Brazil covers almost half of the South American continent and it is bordered to the north, west and south by all South American countries except Chile and Ecuador; to the east is the Atlantic ocean. The country is topographically relatively flat; at no point do the highlands exceed 3,000m (10,000ft). Over 60% of the country is a plateau; the remainder consists of plains. The River Plate Basin (the confluence of the Paraná and Uruguay rivers, both of which have their sources in Brazil) in the far south is more varied, higher and less heavily forested. North of the Amazon are the Guiana Highlands, partly forested, partly stony desert. The Brazilian Highlands of the interior, between the Amazon and the rivers of the south, form a vast tableland, the Mato Grosso, from which rise mountains in the southwest that form a steep protective barrier from the coast called the Great Escarpment, breached by deeply cut river beds. The population is concentrated in the southeastern states of Minas Gerais, Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo. The city of São Paulo has a population of over 12 million, while over 7 million people live in the city of Rio de Janeiro.",['BR'],1,['BRA']
4111,"Due to its long coastline, clearly Chile’s weather is extremely diverse and unpredictable although it is seasonal in much of the country. Summer runs from December to February, and winter from June to August. It is difficult to pinpoint temperatures ranges for the country as a whole as they’re so variable. There’s the dry, arid Atacama desert in the north where temperatures reach a maximum of 32°C (90°F) and can drop to -2°C (28°F). Chile’s central region has a Mediterranean feel with a cold, wet season from May to August, while it is usually always cool and damp in the south. Easter Island has its own humid sub-tropical temperatures, while much of the south, from Region VII down has a very high annual rainfall. Arica, Iquique, Antofagasta, La Serena and Coquimbo are the principal summer beach hubs in the north for local tourists, while Pucón in the south sees high tourism numbers from January to March. Due to its proximity to Santiago, Viña del Mar and Valparaíso beach areas see plenty of sunshine and beach bums during the summer, often filling up with neighbouring Argentinians. As Chile is in the southern hemisphere, the ski season takes place between June and August. In terms of visiting Patagonia and south, the summer months from December to March are ideal as it is warmer for trekking and other outdoor activities. November and April are quieter times in terms of tourism but the weather is less dependable. It isn’t advisable to visit the south from the end of autumn to the end of winter - May to September - as many trails close due to bad weather and strong winds and waterways ice over. However, places in the north, such as the Atacama, can be visited all year round. If visiting the cities, bring lightweight, natural fabrics that can wick away sweat easily. During the wet season, you’ll need to bring waterproofs – aim for breathable materials so you don’t overheat. More substantial waterproofs and warm weather clothing are often needed in the south and at altitude. Chile is situated in South America, bordered to the north by Peru, to the east by Bolivia and Argentina, to the west by the Pacific Ocean and to the south by the Antarctic. The country exercises sovereignty over a number of islands off the coast, including the Juan Fernández Islands and Easter Island. Chile is 4,329km (2,690 miles) long and nowhere more than 180km (112 miles) wide. The Andes and a more westerly coastal highland range run parallel with each other for much of the country's length. The coastal range forms high, sloped cliffs into the sea from the northern to the central area. Between the ranges runs a fertile valley, except in the north where transverse ranges join the two major ones, and in the far south where the sea has broken through the coastal range to form an assortment of archipelagos and channels. Wide variations in soil and a vast difference in climate are reflected in an uneven population distribution, and in a wide range of occupations. The Atacama desert, the driest in the world, is in the northern part of the country, which is also the main mining area. The central zone is predominantly agricultural, and is often referred to as the breadbasket of Chile. This is where the two-thirds of the population reside. Below Concepción, there are large tracts of forested land, although the area also has some agriculture. Chile is prone to frequent powerful earthquakes as the Liquine-Ofqui Fault lies just under the northern Patagonian Andes and runs for 1000km (621 miles).",['CL'],1,['CHL']
4112,"Colombia’s weather offers all four seasons and they remain generally unchanged throughout the year due to Colombia’s proximity to the equator. The topographical diversity of Colombia means that you will find snowy mountain peaks, warm Caribbean beaches and a rainy tropical rainforest at any time of year. This makes the Colombian climate extremely unique and attracts an increasing number of visitors annually. Bogota, the largest city and capital, is situated in the Eastern Andes region and the weather is generally spring-like. Although sunny days can still get quite hot, there are many cool days and nights. The average high temperature throughout the year hovers around 20°C (68°F). For more information about weather in Bogota and things to do there, check out our Bogotá guide. Located in Northern Colombia on the Caribbean coast, Cartagena is another popular spot for tourists. It is a port city known for rich history and beautiful beaches. With temperatures rarely dropping below 30°C (86°F), Cartagena’s climate is perfect for those looking for a warmer, relaxing vacation. You can learn more about Cartagena here. The Amazon region is a place where tourists go to explore the jungle and marvel at the unique species of plants and animals. Located in southern Colombia, the Amazon basin generally stays warm all year round and finds little relief from rain. Although the seasons are unchanging, the best time of year to visit Colombia is December to March. These are the drier months and allow tourists to enjoy more outdoor activities. Major religious holidays will also impact the best time of year to visit. Santa Semana, Holy Week in April, is a stunning time to travel to Colombia. There are ostentatious celebrations and candle-lit mass services to celebrate the Catholic faith. But, hotels book up fast for this week and double their rates, so it is smart to plan in advance. Generally, Colombia’s weather requires light clothing suitable for warm to hot weather. However, if you are staying in a city in the Andes such as Bogotá, long shirts and pants are recommended – preferably a jacket as well. If you are planning to hike in the colder mountainous regions you’ll need durable boots. Breathable walking sandals with good support are recommended for more rural areas. If you are visiting the Amazon, light clothing is required, but long sleeves and trousers for the evenings are useful to prevent mosquito bites. No matter where you are staying, a waterproof jacket is smart to bring for any time of year. Colombia is situated in South America, bordered by the Caribbean Sea, the Pacific Ocean and Panama on the North, Ecuador and Peru on the South, and Venezuela and Brazil on the east. Colombia is home to the Andes, the world’s longest above-water mountain range. The Western and Central Cordilleras of the Andes Mountains are in the west of Colombia – stretching from Ecuador to the Caribbean Sea. The Eastern Cordillera, the longest range, rises northeast from Ecuador to Venezuela. Colombia is divided into three different climatic zones based on elevation. The Tierra Caliente, meaning hot land, is the region below 900 meters (2,953 ft) in elevation. This region spreads over about 86% of the total area of Colombia. The Tierra Templada, meaning temperate land, ranges between 900 to 1,980 meters (6,496 ft) in elevation and is home to most of the country’s population. The area located between 1,980 and 3,500 meters (11,483 ft) is called The Tierra Fria, meaning cold land. The mean range of temperature there is between 10 and 19°C (50 and 66.2°F). The combined area of the flat grassy prairies in eastern Colombia and the jungles and towering rainforests of the Amazon in the south covers nearly 55% of Colombia, yet only 3% of Colombians live there. The tallest peak in Colombia is actually not in the Andes but found in a separate mountain range. It is Pico Cristobal Colon in the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta range and has an estimated height of 5,775 metres (18,950 ft).",['CO'],1,['COL']
4113,"Ecuador has a highly changeable climate, which means that it can be variable at any time. Generally though, in the Sierra, there is little variation by day or by season, with changes occurring as you climb or descend instead. The coastal and Amazonian lowlands have a wet equatorial climate, but the higher you climb the colder it gets. Rainfall is primarily affected by proximity to the eastern or western slopes of the Andes; in the west, June to September are drier with October to May typically wetter; in the east the opposite is true with October to February drier and March to September much wetter. There is also a variation in the amount of rainfall as you journey north to south, with the southern highlands much drier than the landscapes in the north. The coast can be enjoyed all year round, although it is cooler between June and November, when a sea mist known as garua sets in. January to May are consistently the hottest and rainiest months here. The Galapagos are also affected by garua between May and December; January to April here are the hottest months, with heavy but brief rainfall also possible. In the Oriente you can be affected by rainfall at any time, but it is wettest from March to September. Most cities are located in a comfortable subtropical zone. Taking all of this into account, Ecuador’s high season is June to early September. There is a shorter tourist season from December to January as well. However, the country is still not overly busy at any time and it’s easy to engineer an escape from the crowds. The Galapagos however are often very busy and you must book well in advance to visit. Lightweight natural fabrics; rainwear in subtropical areas. Warmer clothes are needed in upland areas. Make sure that you have good-quality, well-broken boots with plenty of ankle support for trekking or walking on uneven terrain. Ecuador comprises a number of very distinct, dramatic geographical regions. The Andes run north-south through the country and form a mountainous spine with a number of peaks over 5,000m (16,404 ft) and some climbing to 6,500m (21,325ft). There are two main ranges, the central Cordillera and the Western Cordillera, which are separated by the Central Valley. At 400km (249 miles) long, the valley is just 50km (31 miles) wide. Its two rims are connected by a series of high plateaux that are separated by a series of gentle ridges. Rivers from the peaks run east to the Amazon and west to the Pacific Ocean. The rims of the valley are crowned with the cones of more than 50 volcanoes, many of which are active. The highest is Chimborazo at 6,310m (19,685ft), although this behemoth is now extinct. Cotopaxi is the highest active volcano in the world at 5,897m (19,347ft) but hasn’t had a major eruption since the 19th century. Pichincha on the other hand issued an enormous mushroom cloud in 1999, Reventador has erupted several times sine 2002 and Sangay continuously fumes and emits ash. Earthquakes are also common in this region. The Sierra, or central highlands, is a central trough. Home to almost half the population, it is also where the oldest and most important cities are situated. The Costa, or coastal plain, in contrast is a lowland area with a belt of hillier ground north of Guayaquil. In the extreme north there is tropical rainforest, whilst in the south the forest thins out and becomes tropical dry forest. East of the Central Cordillera the forest-covered slopes descend into the jungle of the Oriente. This vast region comprises about a third of Ecuador’s total surface area but is very sparsely populated and in fact home to just 5% of the population, most of whom are indigenous Indians or adventurous agriculturalists. The Galapagos Islands lie 1,000km (621 miles) to the west of Ecuador, on the equator. These atolls are in fact the tips of massive volcanoes jutting above the sea and mark the point where two tectonic plates meet. Several of the islands are still active today; Fernandina, which last erupted in 2009, is the most active here. This extreme isolation is what has allowed the evolution of the unique flora and fauna found here.",['EC'],1,['ECU']
4114,"Guyana's climate is warm and tropical throughout the year. The rainfall is generally high for most of the year, as is the humidity. December to January and May to June are the rainy seasons, while in coastal areas the climate is tempered by sea breezes. Guyana lies in the northeast of South America, bordered by Venezuela to the west, Surinam to the southeast and Brazil to the south. It is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the north and east. The word 'Guiana' (the original Amerindian spelling) means 'land of many waters' and the name was well chosen, for there are over 1,600km (965 miles) of navigable rivers in the country. The interior is either high savannah uplands (such as those along the Venezuelan border, called the Rupununi, and the Kanuku Mountains in the far southwest), or thick, hilly jungle and forest, which occupy over 83% of the country's area. The narrow coastal belt contains the vast majority of the population, and produces the major cash crop, sugar, and the major subsistence crop, rice. The country has 322km (206 miles) of coastline. More than 25% of the population lives in or near Georgetown.",['GY'],1,['GUY']
4115,"Subtropical with rapid changes in temperature throughout the year. Summer (December to March) can be very hot. Winter (June to September) is mild with few cold days. Rainfall is heaviest from December to March. Lightweight cottons and linens are worn in warmer months, with somewarm clothes for spring and autumn. Mediumweights are best for winter.Rainwear is advisable throughout the year. Paraguay is a landlocked country surrounded by Argentina, Bolivia and Brazil, lying some 1,440km (900 miles) up the River Paraná from the Atlantic. The River Paraguay, a tributary of the Paraná, divides the country into two sharply contrasting regions. The Oriental zone, which covers 159,800 sq km (61,700 sq miles), consists of undulating country intersected by chains of hills rising to about 600m (2,000ft), merging into the Mato Grosso Plateau in the north; the Paraná crosses the area in the east and south. East and southeast of Asunción lie the oldest centres of settlement inhabited by the greater part of the population. This area is bordered to the west by rolling pastures, and to the south by thick primeval forests. The Occidental zone, or Paraguayan Chaco, covers 246,827 sq km (95,300 sq miles). It is a flat alluvial plain, composed mainly of grey clay, which is marked by large areas of permanent swamp in the southern and eastern regions. Apart from a few small settlements, it is sparsely populated.",['PY'],1,['PRY']
4116,"The weather in Peru varies according to area – the changes in altitude are so extreme that the climate goes from freezing snow in the mountains to boiling sun on the coast. Likewise, the coast covers such a large stretch of longitude that the temperature changes dramatically as you head further south. On the coast winter lasts from June to September. The weather tends to be overcast and slightly damp at this time, but rarely very cold. It hardly ever rains in Lima nor most of the coast, except for Tumbes and Piura, which have tropical climates. During June to September, the mountainous areas are often sunny during the day but cold at night. This is high tourist season and the best time to visit most regions. Rainy season in the Andes starts in September and peaks between January and March, and this is a dreadful and occasionally dangerous time to be hiking. Heavy rains in the mountains and jungle last from December to April. It is rainy and hot for most of the year, but between March and September there are occasional cold surges which might require a jumper. For travel in Peru, a variety of clothes are necessary. You will need very lightweight clothes for summer on the coast, and thermals, hats, gloves and ski jackets for winter up in the mountains. It can become freezing at night at altitude and remain hot and sticky through the nights in the jungle. Waterproof clothing is thoroughly recommended for the rainy season, because the heavens open very suddenly, and then it pours. If you are travelling to the jungle you’ll need something protective and waterproof for your feet. For any mountain hiking you’ll need proper, supportive boots. If you’re spending time along the coast you’ll need sandals or flip-flops. Peru is a large, mountainous country on the Pacific coast of South America that borders Ecuador and Colombia to the north, Brazil and Bolivia to the east, and Chile to the south. The Pacific Ocean lies to the west. There are three natural zones: The Costa region, which contains Lima (the capital), is a narrow coastal plain consisting of large tracts of desert broken by fertile valleys. The cotton, sugar and rice plantations and most of the so-far exploited oil fields lie in this area, as does the majority of the population. The best roads run along the coast, having straight, flat paths ahead of them, and travel times are usually good. The highland Sierra contains the Andes, with peaks over 6,000m (20,000ft), most of the country's mineral resources (silver, zinc, lead, copper and gold) and the greater part of its livestock. Roads in this area wind up, down and around mountains, so travelling in this area is often time-consuming. The Selva (jungle), an area of fertile, subtropical land, lies between the Andes and the borders with Brazil, Bolivia, Colombia and Ecuador. The Amazonian jungle has vast natural resources. The absence of land communications, however, left the area largely uncharted until full-scale oil exploration began in 1973. Even today roads barely penetrate the region. Some areas are best reached by small plane.",['PE'],1,['PER']
4117,"Tropical and humid, cooled by the northeast trade winds. The best time to visit is February to April (short dry season) and August to October (long dry season). The rainy seasons last from November to January and from May to July. Surinam lies outside the hurricane zone and the most extreme weather condition is the sibibusi (forest broom), a heavy rain shower. Lightweights and rainwear. Surinam is bordered to the north by the Atlantic Ocean, to the east by the Marowijne River (which forms the border with French Guiana), to the west by the Corantijn River (which forms the border with Guyana), and to the south by forests, savannahs and mountains, which separate it from Brazil. In the northern part of the country are coastal lowlands covered with mangrove swamps. Further inland runs a narrow strip of savannah land. To the south, the land becomes hilly and then mountainous, covered with dense tropical forest, and cut by numerous rivers and streams.",['SR'],1,['SUR']
4118,"Uruguay has an exceptionally fine temperate climate, with mild summers and winters. Summer is from December to March and is the most pleasant time, especially along the coast. Beach resorts get crowded between Christmas and February, with peak crowds during the month of January. In the interior and along the Río Uruguay, January is the hottest month, with temperatures sometimes climbing uncomfortably above 30˚C (86°F). For fine weather and quieter conditions countrywide, December and March are good months to visit. Winter and spring can get chilly due to wind and rain, but temperatures remain dependably above freezing. Bring lightweight clothing in summer; mediumweight clothing for winter, autumn and spring. A raincoat is advisable year-round. Uruguay is bordered to the north by Brazil, to the southeast by the Atlantic, and is separated from Argentina in the west and south by the River Uruguay, which widens out into the Rio de la Plata estuary. The landscape is made up of hilly meadows broken by streams and rivers. There are a string of beaches along the coast. Most of the country is grazing land for sheep and cattle. Montevideo, the most southern point of the nation, accommodates nearly half of the population. About 90% of the land is suitable for agriculture, although only 12% is used in this way.",['UY'],1,['URY']
4119,"Venezuela's location perched 8° above the equator, means it generally enjoys a balmy warm climate. Temperatures don't fluctuate wildly, hovering between 26°C (79°F) and 28°C (82°F) and making the country something of an all year round destination. The coastal regions on the Caribbean feel balmiest, and the lowland areas also enjoy a tropical climate. The main factor in temperature variance is altitude. The mountainous Andean regions are significantly cooler, and temperatures can drop to around 9°C (48°F). Venezuela's rainy season runs from May to December. During this period, there is the possibility of flooding in certain low-lying areas, such as the Llanos and in some valleys of the Andes. The dry season is from December to April, with January and February being the coolest months, and July and August being the warmest. The best time to visit the Andes mountains is from October to May, before the rains come in June. Venezuela's weather is quite changeable, and even during the dry season there's always a chance of rain. If you're up in the northern mountainous region, you're likely to encounter a good few downpours. Lightweight cottons and jeans will be suitable in most locations, whether in the lowlands or on the coast. Pack a sweater or jacket if you're planning to spend any time in the Andes. It's also a good idea to take some waterproofs or a sturdy umbrella whichever region you're visiting. Situated in the north east corner of the South American continent, Venezuela is bordered to the north by the Caribbean, to the east by Guyana and the Atlantic Ocean, to the south by Brazil, and to the west and southwest by Colombia. The country consists of four distinctive regions: the Venezuelan Highlands in the west; the Maracaibo Lowlands in the northwest; the vast central plain of Los Llanos around the Orinoco River; and the Guyana region in the extreme south, which includes part of the Amazon rainforest and the Guyana highlands. Various parts of Venezuela, including Caracas and the eastern part of Sucre, are vulnerable to earthquakes, although there have been no serious ones for many years. Important topographical features include the Orinoco river, the largest river in South America after the Amazon, at a length of 2,140km (1,330 miles), and the dramatic table top mountains known as tepuis, which are found in the Guyana highlands. Angel Falls, situated in the Canaima National Park is the highest waterfall in the world, plunging into the Orinoco from a height of 979m (3,212ft). The Andes mountain range crosses the northwestern region of the country, with the highest peak Pico Bolivar reaching heights of 5,007m (16,427ft).",['VE'],1,['VEN']
