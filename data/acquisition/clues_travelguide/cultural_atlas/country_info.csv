egyptian,"['Honour', 'Loyalty', 'Communitarian', 'Education', 'Modesty', 'Pride', 'Egypt, the 15th most populous country in the world, is an Arab nation bordered by Israel, Libya and Sudan. It has a global reputation due to the legacy of its ancient cultural roots. While the country’s heritage remains a source of great pride, Egypt’s contemporary culture has also been shaped by more recent historical events. Many traditional values continue to be defining aspects of Egyptian culture; however, these are now accompanied by new ideas and values. Furthermore, as the gateway between northeast Africa and the Middle East, it has been significantly influenced by various interactions with other cultures and countries.', 'Geography and Spaces', 'An overwhelming majority of the population (approximately 95%) reside in the narrow strip of fertile land along the Nile River, which is roughly 5% of the country’s land area. This means that crowded conditions are a normal part of daily life for most Egyptians. Many people have largely adapted to this close proximity.', 'The Nile River separates the two main regions of Egypt: the ‘Valley’ or ‘Sa’id’ (south of the Nile) and the Delta (north of the Nile). These two regions vary greatly in regard to general attitudes and culture. Those in the south (Sa’id) are often more conservative and religious. They may refer to themselves as people of ‘honour’ (see ', 'Honour and Dignity', ' below). Those who live in the north, particularly from the larger cities, are often more liberal and open to a greater diversity of lifestyles. The diversity in the large cities of Cairo and Alexandria is in part due to the presence of immigrants, refugees and tourists. Lifestyle patterns in these areas generally resemble globalised urban culture. In addition, the strong economic and cultural influence of the United States can be seen in the art, literature and cuisine of urban Egypt.', 'The tendency to adopt more collectivist or individualist attitudes often varies according to one’s social class and living arrangements. Those who can afford to live in larger homes often lean towards an individualistic mindset. Meanwhile, those in slums or rural areas tend to emphasise a sense of community over individual privacy and private property.', 'The concentration of the population along the Nile contributes to high birth rates, leading to a rapidly expanding population. Accordingly, over half of the Egyptian population are 24 years old or younger. Young children are seemingly everywhere, serving as a constant reminder of the country’s population growth. These two factors – population growth and density – have led to stress on natural and economic resources. One consequence is chronic underemployment for the predominantly youthful population, leading many Egyptians to seek education and/or employment abroad.', 'Social Stratification', 'A person’s place of origin and social class are important determinants for guiding how people interact with one another. The social class an Egyptian is born into tends to dictate many aspects of their everyday life and access to opportunities. Status is defined more in terms of one’s family background and reputation rather than wealth, making social mobility difficult.', 'One marker often used to determine social class is the university one attends. Education is highly valued in Egypt and families invest a lot in educating their children regardless of their income. Attaining a high level of education is one of the few avenues for social mobility. Moreover, being able to speak fluent English or French often indicates that one is highly educated and probably from an upper social class.', 'In recent years, the rigid social class structure has undergone significant change, with digital media – particularly social media platforms – now playing an important role in the dissemination and expression of Egyptian culture. Given the country’s low rates of literacy, digital media has helped make popular culture and the arts more widely accessible. Moreover, the Internet has provided access to several types of information previously blocked by government censors. Access to alternative ideas led many Egyptians to question the ', 'status quo', ', and this played an important role in the Egyptian Revolution.', 'The Egyptian Revolution (2011)', 'In 2011, widespread protests called for an end to the regime of longtime president Hosni Mubarak. Participants in the movement were predominantly middle class citizens that organised and coordinated demonstrations through social media platforms. While they were the main driving force behind the revolt, members of lower social classes also took to the streets. The overall slogan of the revolution, “bread, freedom and social justice” (', 'aīsh, hirriyya, ‘adāla igtimā’iyya', '), resonated with the wider population, not just the middle class.', 'Under intense pressure from the public and factions within the military, Mubarak ultimately resigned as president and was later found guilty of a number of crimes and imprisoned. There was virtually no censorship amid the revolution, and much of the Egyptian population was able to be openly critical of Egyptian society and push for new ideas (such as secularism and social capitalism). This turn towards liberalism was short-lived as the conservative Muslim Brotherhood stepped into the power vacuum. A Muslim Brotherhood candidate was democratically elected to replace Mubarak. The Muslim Brotherhood attempted to resume censorship and suppress dissent, which led to a second wave of protests and a military coup. In 2014, former Egyptian defence minister Abdel Fattah el-Sisi was elected as the new president.', 'The end of Mubarak’s 30-year rule has affected all domains of Egyptian life. Over the past few years, there has been a growth in ‘', 'ashwa’iyyat', '’ (slum areas) around major cities such as Cairo, reflecting the widening gap between the rich and the poor.', 'Ethnicity and Identity', 'Generally, Egypt is quite a homogeneous society, with 99.6% being ethnically Egyptian. Most of the Egyptian population identify as Muslim, with the majority belonging to the Sunni variant (see ', 'Islam', '\xa0in ', 'Religion', '). Islamic tradition has a deep influence on the identity of many Egyptians, due to its longstanding presence and position in the culture. Perhaps the most significant unifying component of the Egyptian identity is the language as nearly all Egyptians speak in the Egyptian dialect of Arabic. However, there is significant diversity within Egyptian dialects of Arabic, so much so that some native speakers may not be able to understand each other.', 'The Egyptian Revolution brought to the forefront questions of ethnic and cultural identity regarding Egypt’s position within the wider Arab world. The country is important to the Arab world, with the Arab League headquarters being located in Cairo. Moreover, Egypt is one of the Arab world’s literary centres, producing many of modern Arabic literature’s foremost writers. However, Egyptians continue to debate whether they feel a stronger affinity to being ‘Egyptian’ or ‘Arab’ on both an individual and national level, indicating that Egyptian and Arabic culture are not synonymous.', 'Honour and Dignity', 'Some cultural values are generally upheld across all geographic and class distinctions in Egypt. The notion of honour ', '(sharaf)', ' is a central concept that guides behaviour and significantly influences interactions in Egyptian culture. It is deeply intertwined with people’s ideas about\xa0their personal dignity ', '(karama)', '. Traditionally, a man’s honour was determined by his ability to protect the women in his care. While many cultural ideas of honourable behaviour may still be related to patriarchal responsibility, such traditional customs tend to be prevalent only in more rural areas.', 'Honour in modern-day Egypt is more commonly determined by the degree to which people exhibit and respect common cultural values of modesty, loyalty, honesty and hospitality. For example, the way they dress, the way they present themselves, the hospitality they show friends and guests, and the respect they give the elderly and those in authority can be perceived to reflect their honour and dignity ', '(sharaf ', 'and', ' karama)', '. Pride and status is found in being helpful, generous and charitable to others. Everyone is also expected to be loyal to his family and ‘a man of his word’. As Egypt is generally a collectivist society, the needs of one’s family or community typically take precedence over one’s personal needs or desires.', 'One’s honour is intertwined with family reputation in Egypt and, thus, preservation of honour is often understood in terms of the collective rather than the individual. In the event of an individual’s failure or shortcoming, the whole family’s name and honour is often affected, and shame is felt by everyone related to the person. In this way, there is a cultural pressure for individuals to protect their family’s reputation by stressing their positive qualities, emphasising their family members’ achievements and adhering to social expectations. As honesty is highly valued in Egyptian culture, failing to uphold one’s promise is a quick way to bring dishonour on one’s family.']"

The country has the second biggest population in Africa, with over 40% of people being under 15 years of age.', '1', ' Due to the vast size of the population, it is important to recognise that descriptions of Ethiopian cultural customs can vary significantly. There are many distinct cultural practices that are specific to people’s region, ethnicity or religion. Despite this diversity, Ethiopians are generally united by their patriotism and pride in the country’s overarching cultural identity.', 'Ethiopia is the oldest independent country in Africa, once ruled as a dynasty by a series of monarchs. It is distinct from most other African nations as it is one of the only countries that successfully resisted European ', 'colonisation', '. It also has a historical connection to Christianity, with the region adopting the religion before many Western nations were exposed to it. This legacy of the country’s independence and the ', 'Ethiopian ‘Tewahedo’ Orthodox Church', ' are very important to Ethiopians’ sense of national pride. Their sense of morality and cultural refinement are shaped by centuries of practice and continue to inform how they see themselves in the contemporary setting. Generally speaking, Ethiopians are renowned for being welcoming, considerate, cooperative and non-confrontational people.', 'Habesha Culture and Identity', 'Ethiopians and Eritreans both generally identify as ‘', 'habesha', '’. This term is used to describe the unique culture and people of the Ethiopian/Eritrean region, regardless of ethnicity. Historically, “', 'habesha', '” exclusively referred to the Semitic tribes and ethnicities in Eritrea and northern Ethiopia (such as the Amhara, Tigray and Tigrinya people). Today, however, ', 'habesha', ' is commonly used as a unifying word to describe all people in the region, regardless of ethnicity or tribe. The habesha identity and culture is a very important source of pride for many Ethiopians as it encapsulates the way their culture differs from the rest of Africa. The word is also used in Omotic and other languages, and by some ethnicities in other countries.', 'Having never been colonised, the Ethiopian region differs from other African countries in many ways. The customs of Ethiopia continue to be deeply rooted in centuries of practice, and many aspects of daily life are ritualised. For example, there is a correct and traditional way to serve coffee, fold a dress, cut chicken and greet people. The country also has its own ancient alphabet and calendar that are still in use. Moreover, the country is home to one of the earliest Christian organisations, the ', 'Ethiopian ‘Tewahedo’ Orthodox Church', ', which remains the most popular religion. ', 'Ultimately, Ethiopian culture is often unable to be neatly categorised. It shares similarities with some Arab or Mediterranean cultures, although these descriptors also do not fit. Rather, “', 'Habesha', '” epitomizes the culture that is unique to the region.', 'Ethnicity and Language', 'While certain cultural traditions and ', 'habesha', ' customs are emblematic of the Ethiopian national and cultural identity, individual practices differ between regions, religions and ethnicities. Ethiopia contains over 80 different ', 'ethnic groups', '. Their ancestries vary, with some tracing back to Bantu or Nilotic tribes of sub-Saharan Africa, whilst others have a closer heritage to the Cushitic tribes of the Middle East. According to the 2007 census, the largest ethnic groups are the Oromo (43.4% of the population), Amhara (26.9%), Somali (6.2%), Tigray (6.1%) and Sidama (4%). Other significant ethnic populations include the Gurage, Welaita, Hadiya and Afar people. Historically, each ethnic group has been divided into tribes and sub-tribes on the basis of people’s descent from common ancestors. This is still the case for many living in rural areas, particularly among pastoralists in less developed regions. However, tribal organisational structures have been dismantled in many areas, particularly urban spaces.', 'Each ethnic group has distinct cultural practices and speaks a language specific to their ', 'ethnicity', ' (e.g. Oromos speak Oromiffa and Tigrayans speak Tigrinya). In total, there are 87 native languages spoken in Ethiopia.', '2', ' Amharic is the only language that has official status throughout the entire country. Meanwhile, Somali, Oromiffo, Afar and Tigrinya have official status in the regional states where they constitute the ethnic majority. English is also the most widely understood foreign language. Most urban Ethiopians speak Amharic, their local/ethnic language and English.', 'Ethnic Relations', 'Ethiopia has been organised as an ‘ethnic federation’ since 1995. This means that the country’s states are divided on an ethnic basis, with most people living in the region or zone where their ethnicity is the majority. For example, most Oromos live in the Oromia region, Amharas live in the Amhara region, Tigrayans live in the Tigray region, and so forth. The idea behind this state system was to allow ethnic groups more political autonomy. However, it is widely believed that this government structure has overly politicised ', 'ethnic identity', ' and created more sectarian tension. Moreover, many people have ethnically mixed heritage and may not feel a close affiliation with one homogeneous ethnic identity. Most people living in central Ethiopia (e.g. the capital city, Addis Ababa) prefer to identify as simply “Ethiopian” but are required to associate with an ethnic identity.', 'It is generally believed that those belonging to an ethnic group with political power have better access to services and face fewer bureaucratic barriers. Therefore, there are some concerns that ethnic Tigrayans dominate positions of power in the intelligence services, the military and business despite making up only around 6.1% of the Ethiopian population.', '3', ' There is also widespread opinion that the Ethiopian national identity is more (or overly) reflective of the Amharas. This is exacerbated by the fact that Amharic is the official national language and Amharic speakers often have more access to opportunity. Some ethnicities may feel that their ethnic group has been excluded from the ruling class. For example, there continues to be underlying tension over the fact that Oromos have not had the most political influence despite being the largest ethnic group.', 'Ethnic tension usually occurs between the government and a tribe or group in a specific region. Generally, anyone who openly protests against the government may face a high risk of official violence, particularly if they oppose the government on issues relevant to their region or ', 'ethnicity', '.', '4', ' Oromos, Somalis, Anuak, Eritreans and Ethiopians of Eritrean origin report being at particular risk of official discrimination on the basis of their ', 'ethnicity', '. Nevertheless, it is important to note that while ethnic tension exists, open hostility is not noticeable among the general public on a day-to-day basis. Most people find common ground under a strong national identity, as well as the unique ', 'habesha', ' identity.', 'National Identity and Pride', 'It is common to encounter quite patriotic views among Ethiopians. Many feel their country has great cultural depth and wealth in comparison to others. For example, there is a general expectation that an Ethiopian living overseas will eventually want to return or stay connected to their country (regardless of improved living circumstances elsewhere) as their culture is incomparable. Ethiopians also share a deep pride in the country’s legacy and what it symbolises as a historically independent African nation. The Ethiopian Empire (also known as ', 'Abyssinia', ') was one of the last active empires in the world. Its strong statehood was a key to Ethiopia’s successful resistance to ', 'colonisation', '.', '5', ' The fact that the culture was untouched by colonialism and continues to be taught in its original form by its own people is a massive source of pride for Ethiopians.', 'Ethiopians are also often keen to point out that they are one of the only African nations that were not introduced to Christianity by Europeans. Rather, Ethiopia was one of the first countries to declare Christianity as the official state religion in 333 CE. As such, the Ethiopian Orthodox Church is a strong national symbol and continues to be practised in reflection of its historic roots. While it is often understated, one may find that Ethiopians are very confident in the righteousness of their faith. Indeed, many have a quiet sense of conviction in their cultural refinement and morals, seeing themselves as sophisticated and progressive people.', 'It is important to appreciate the legacy and depth of Ethiopian culture in order to understand how Ethiopians see themselves in the contemporary setting. People generally do not view events of recent history (such as the political regimes, wars with neighbouring countries or famines) as things that define the country or its people. Rather, most Ethiopians see the hardship and political turmoil of the past few decades as a recent devastating chapter in a much longer history of independence and achievement. In this way, it is common for Ethiopians to express disappointment or dismay at the fact that most Western perceptions of their country have been formulated around these humanitarian crises. Nevertheless, it is also important to understand the political history of the last century, as these hardships have influenced Ethiopian society and shaped the ', 'diaspora', ' living overseas.', 'Political History', 'Ethiopia’s final emperor, Haile Selassie, was overthrown by a coup in 1974. A military government, known as “', 'the Derg', '”, was established in his place and Ethiopia was declared a socialist state. The Derg became known as a ruthless regime that carried out extrajudicial killings, limited political freedoms and repressed opponents in order to maintain its power. During the Derg era, many ongoing internal conflicts erupted as multiple rebel groups fought against the power of government, and different ethnic groups fought for independence (e.g. the Eritrean People’s Liberation Front). There was also a war with neighbouring ', 'Somalia', ' that came at a high human cost. Multiple conflicts and government-sanctioned violence resulted in hundreds of thousands of deaths and large internal and external displacement as people fled the country. It is estimated over 30,000 people were killed between 1977 and 1987 alone on suspicion of anti-government activity during a period known as the Red Terror, or ‘', 'Qey Shibir', '’. Ethiopia was also plagued by severe droughts that caused widespread famine over the 20th century. Ultimately, all these factors led to widespread displacement, poverty, political instability and the stagnation of development.', 'In 1991, a coalition of rebel groups succeeded in overthrowing the Derg. In the same year, Eritrea gained independence from Ethiopia after almost 30 years of fighting for secession. Political tensions between Ethiopia and Eritrea were not resolved, and in 1998, a war erupted as the two countries contested the demarcations of the border. The fighting had devastating humanitarian costs, ending with Ethiopia declaring a military victory and occupying most of the disputed territory in 2000. However, hostilities continued, and the two governments continued to operate under a “state of war”, effectively cutting off the populations from one another.', 'The two-decade-long political, economic and social divide between the people of Eritrea and Ethiopia has posed many challenges. The war created rigid borders where fluid boundaries between the nations had previously existed.', '6', ' Some see the divide as a result of politics (rather than people and culture) as Eritreans and Ethiopians are historically and culturally interconnected in many ways. Indeed, it is common for ', 'expatriate', ' Eritrean and Ethiopian communities to converge under the broader ', 'habesha', ' identity. Nevertheless, thousands of Eritreans and Ethiopians of Eritrean origin were deported from Ethiopia, and vice versa.', '7', ' This created a humanitarian crisis and also an identity crisis for many people who previously felt a national belonging to both countries in some way.', 'Current Situation', 'Ethiopia’s political history may still be a sensitive issue, particularly for those who were displaced. Every Ethiopian family is likely to have their own personal experiences of the era of the Derg or the effects of the war with Eritrea. However, there tends to be a generational divide in attitudes. For example, those among the younger generation of Ethiopians tend to harbour less hostility against Eritrea than those who were directly affected by violence. Today, many people are more concerned with present-day matters, such as internal conflict and ethnic tension. There continue to be localised regional conflicts between the government and certain tribes or ethnicities in specified regions. More broadly, political freedoms are restricted throughout Ethiopia, especially since the introduction of a State of Emergency in October 2016. Surveillance, harassment, arrest and detainment of political opposition are common.', 'However, this political situation is changing rapidly. In April 2018, the new Prime Minister of Ethiopia Abiy Ahmed began implementing major ', 'democratic', ' reforms as the new Prime Minister of Ethiopia. At the time of writing, Ahmed has released thousands of political prisoners and lifted the State of Emergency. He has also re-established diplomatic relations with Eritrea for the first time in 20 years. Much hope has been ignited for Ethiopia, with some hailing the new Prime Minister as a prophet.', '8', ' Nevertheless, people remain mostly concerned with challenges relating to matters of employment, inflation and the rising cost of living.', '9', 'Social Structure and Interactions', 'The majority of the Ethiopian population belongs to the lower class, living in small villages or sprawling urban settlements surrounding cities. Roughly 80% of Ethiopians live rurally; the capital city is the only urban area with over a million people. A sizable ‘middle class’ exists in cities. These people are not necessarily part of the elite or the lower class. For example, they might be families that have international contacts or support from relatives living overseas. Differences in wealth may be noticeable in people’s homes or by the size of their plots of land.', 'A person’s wealth tends to be the biggest determinant of their status within their community. Ethiopians generally respect those with money, regardless of other social indicators. Education is valued but does not necessarily earn public respect in the same way. Rather, it is often seen as a skill that can improve livelihoods and social mobility between generations. ', 'Parents aspire for their children to be educated as a route out of poverty and as a way of being supported in their old age. However, it is not always possible for children to remain in school as they have to support their families by working. Children are often required to help with domestic tasks or work from a young age. A 2016 study on a group of children found that 98% were doing some type of work by the age of 12 (e.g. working on the family farm or business).', '10', ' People are moving to the city for higher wages and better educational opportunities at increasing rates.', '11', ' Emigration overseas is also generally viewed positively as it is understood that such individuals contribute to Ethiopia by supporting households and communities back home.', '12', ' Indeed, many Ethiopians living overseas may have whole families or communities depending on them through remittances.', 'Collective Life and Community Belonging', 'There is a very strong community focus embedded in Ethiopian culture. People are often mutually reliant on their relatives and neighbours. This ', 'collectivistic', ' aspect of the culture is described as ‘', 'mahiberawi nuro', '’ (literally meaning ‘collective life’). As the government cannot be relied on to provide social support, one’s welfare is usually dependent on the generosity of their family and friends. For example, it is common for a family to send their daughter to a different city to care for a relative if they fall sick.', '13', ' Individuals may also receive social, emotional and financial support from the broader community and public when going through particular hardship. Local churches and mosques often play a key role in mobilising community support. However, this community-minded generosity must be reciprocated for it to be received. Individuals are expected to put others before themselves in order to be a meaningful member of society. Those people who are not similarly kind and helpful may not receive support during times of need.', ""Ethiopia's community focus also gives the culture a strong social dimension. It is common for people to meet friends, play with children, or socialise in public places without having to organise to do so. For example, Ethiopians may be able to maintain a healthy social life simply by drinking coffee on popular streets, watching locals, and waiting to be spoken to by those passing. People often get to know many of the locals in their village or town, reinforcing a sense of community belonging."", 'Many Ethiopians report that they miss this aspect of their culture whilst living overseas in English-speaking Western countries. They often describe how strangers in Ethiopia are met with a very welcoming and playful attitude, an approach that they have not necessarily experienced living overseas. Some Ethiopians also report that they feel spontaneous generosity is more common in Ethiopia. For example, a stranger may pay for someone’s food without telling them. This selflessness is related to the concept of ‘', 'yilugnta', '’.', 'Yilugnta (Selflessness or Public Self-Consciousness)', 'The generosity and selflessness of Ethiopians are commonly attributed to the concept of ‘', 'yilugnta', '’. Many Ethiopians would describe ""having yilugnta"" as possessing a selfless concern for others, regardless of one’s own situation. While this word does not have a direct English translation, yilugnta generally describes being considerate of others’ feelings or having an awareness of how one’s actions are seen through others’ eyes.', '14', ' Some associate it with questions such as “What would the neighbours think?” or “How would others judge my behaviour?”. This sense of public self-consciousness generally motivates Ethiopians to be appeasing, cooperative and considerate of others.', '15', 'Yilugnta sees people be more hospitable, inclusive, community-minded and cooperative, as these are all important virtues in Ethiopian society. It reinforces important cultural values and rules of interaction/social graces (', 'sene magber', ') in almost every aspect of people’s lives. For example, it encourages children to be very obedient and respectful towards their parents. In general, yilugnta shapes Ethiopian culture to have an emphasis on personal representation; how people behave, present themselves and treat others is seen to reflect their honour.', 'Tolerance, Patience and Stoicism', 'Ethiopians are often perceived to be considerate, modest, mild-mannered or unconfrontational people. This is often noticed in the way people can be very tolerant of inconvenience. For example, Ethiopians are likely to go out of their way to accommodate a guest even if they do not have adequate means to support them or the person arrived at an inappropriate time. Generally, people tend to be quite patient and passive unless a situation escalates to a point that they have no choice but to react. This behaviour is often further reinforced by the concept of ', 'yilugnta', ', whereby Ethiopians restrain themselves from expressing negative emotions to prevent offence. ', 'There is also a cultural tendency towards stoicism, whereby people resist complaining and downplay personal difficulties. Many Ethiopians are reluctant to burden others with their problems and prefer to manage issues privately. This social norm is reinforced by religious ideals, which encourage individuals to exhibit tolerance, self-restraint, and courage in the face of adversity. Stoicism may also be informed by a sense of fatalism.

The country is situated directly on the equator and contains an abundant and diverse set of wildlife and landscapes. Kenya’s population is also ethnically diverse. Throughout Kenya's history, various African ethnic groups and sub-ethnic groups have interacted with one another. Kenya has also had interactions with various non-African countries and people. For instance, during the mid 18th century, Arabs ruled the Kenyan coast from the island of Zanzibar. Just under 200 years later, Kenya became a colony of Great Britain. The British introduced Christianity and brought people from India and other parts of the empire."", 'Kenya gained independence in 1963 after a period of violent revolts known as the Mau Mau Uprising (1953-1960). Although this was not a bloodless transition to independence, the Mau Mau Uprising was a more peaceful transition than a lot of other countries on the African continent experienced. The legacies of such historical events remain visible in contemporary Kenyan society. Today, there are at least 40 different Kenyan ethnic groups, along with Asian and European groups. Moreover, most of the country identifies as Christian (82.1%). Overall, Kenyans are generally warm and friendly and place a high value on their connections with their family, friends and community.', 'Geographical Distinctions', 'The population of Kenya is concentrated in the southern parts of the country, where most people live in rural towns and villages. Nearly three-quarters of the population (73.5%) reside in rural parts of the country. The type of housing varies between ethnic groups. Some ethnic groups, such as the Maasai and Pokot, retain a nomadic lifestyle whereby houses can be dismantled and packed away when the inhabitants leave in search of better pastures for their livestock. However, this has shifted to only males moving with the herds. For other ethnic groups, extended families live in small compounds with fixed housing. The percentage of the population living in rural areas has been gradually decreasing with more Kenyans moving to cities in search of employment and education opportunities.', ""In the cities of Kenya, housing varies depending on one's socioeconomic status. For example, those in the upper class have large, secure complexes while those in the middle to upper class reside in modern apartment blocks. People of lower socioeconomic standing often live in shanty towns located within or on the outskirts of Kenya's cities."", 'It is important to bear in mind that the experiences and lifestyles of those in Nairobi or other urban areas differ considerably from that of people residing in rural parts of the country. Those in rural areas and villages tend to practise a more traditional Kenyan lifestyle. Conversely, people in urban areas reflect the changing face of Kenya and the influences of globalisation and multiculturalism. In Kenya’s capital of Nairobi, it is common to see the modern and traditional elements of Kenyan culture blended together.', 'Ethnic Groups and Languages', ""Kenya has incredible ethnic diversity. More than half of the country's ethnic groups have Bantu origins. The largest ethnic group in Kenya is the Kikuyu people (22%). Other major ethnic groups include the Luhya (14%), Luo (13%), Kalenjin (12%), Kamba (11%), Kisii (6%) and Meru (6%). Each tribe is further divided into clans or sub-tribes, sometimes understood as a family. For example, there are approximately 18 clans in the Luhya tribe. Kenyans tend to associate certain social qualities with different ethnic groups. Keep in mind that some of these associations may be based on outdated or inaccurate stereotypes. For instance, the Luo are often seen as being proud of their language and culture. Similar distinctions of social characteristics are made within ethnic groups as well. For example, among the Kikuyu people, those living in Nyeri are commonly seen as industrious or entrepreneurs."", 'It is important to understand that ethnic categories in Kenya are complex and sometimes overlapping. Previously, there were strong tensions between ethnic groups, partly due to the legacy of colonial rule by the British. During this time, different ethnicities were confined to specific geographic areas, and some ethnic groups were prioritised above others. This was on the basis of whether the ethnic community collaborated or rebelled against colonial rule. Today, the stratification between ethnicities has diminished and Kenyans generally coexist peacefully. Ethnic group and ', 'clan', ' distinctions were considered very important in past generations. Indeed, ', 'ethnicity', ' was often the basis for selecting a spouse and, at times, one’s friends. However, younger generations of Kenyans tend to pay less attention to ethnic distinctions.', 'The fact that the country is host to large refugee populations from surrounding countries also contributes to Kenya’s diversity. As of January 2018, UNHCR estimates there are 486,460\xa0refugees and asylum seekers residing in Kenya (most of which are Somalian and South Sudanese).1 There is also a presence of non-African ethnicities in Kenya. For example,\xa0‘Wazungu’\xa0(directly translates as ‘White Person’) refers to the white population in Kenya. The Wazungu are widely associated with British settlers. Today, the dwindling Wazungu is a mix of third-generation European-Kenyans, business persons and members of international aid organisations. There are also some Asian communities in the country, with many being descendants of indentured labourers from India during the British colonial era. Both the Wazungu and Asian groups make up approximately 1% of the population.', 'Personal and National Identity', 'Many Kenyans identify with their tribe or ethnic group. Many Kenyans follow traditions that relate to their ', 'ethnicity', ', from the name they give their children to the way they serve their food. People are often especially proud of their native language as it tends to be correlated with their ethnic identity. There are occasional tensions between ethnic groups. Such tensions tend to flare up during election season in Kenya, such as the 2007 election and the recent 2017 general election. This is in part due to historical circumstances where specific ethnic groups, such as the Kikuyu, were more represented in the independence movement as well as more favoured by the political elite. Thus, some ethnic groups dominate the political sphere.', 'Nevertheless, there is still a strong sense of national identity. Many are proud of their cultural heritage, accomplishments and the country’s successful efforts to achieve independence and economic growth. Moreover, overt expressions of tribalism are becoming more taboo in the country.', 'The language of Swahili (also known as ‘Kiswahili’) has also helped shape a common national identity that transcends ethnic boundaries. Almost all Kenyans can speak Swahili, which was selected as the national language of Kenya after independence partly due to its linguistic commonality with other Bantu-based languages in the country. English is also an official language and is mainly used for business, education and official purposes. Hence, many Kenyans also speak English at a high proficiency. Along with Swahili and English, each ethnic group speaks its language as a native tongue. Most languages in Kenya fall into one of two categories: Bantu or Nilotic. Swahili is commonly used when Kenyans communicate to other Kenyans from a different ethnic group.', 'Society and Social Structure', 'Kenya has quite a hierarchical society. This is noticeable in the pronounced differences in wealth. Land ownership is a valued indicator of one’s socioeconomic status. In rural parts of Kenya, most people have access to small plots of cultivable land known as ‘shambas’. These plots are gradually diminishing in size as each generation divides the land among typically the adult sons. Today, it is common for men to purchase land in addition to their inheritance. For some ethnic groups, the ownership of animals such as cattle, goats and sheep is an important indicator of wealth.', ""Education is also highly valued and respected with regard to one's socioeconomic status. In Kenya, many view education as a way to transcend their socioeconomic status as well as a way to demonstrate one's abilities. Many Kenyans work in a sector known as the ‘Jua Kali'\xa0(‘hot sun') sector. This sector primarily refers to trades jobs in areas such as car repair, woodwork, welding and construction. It also includes less physically laborious trades such as handicrafts and plant nurseries. The Jua Kali sector enables people to generate income along with providing social support networks for women engaging in the sector."", 'Collectivism and Interactions', ""Kenya is highly collectivistic, meaning people are highly interdependent on their social and family circles. Individuals often feel a sense of responsibility to those around them and are expected to be willing to sacrifice their interests for the group. In Kenya, the ‘group' is often defined as one's family. An individual is usually expected to assist less-fortunate fellow family members, often through financial assistance. For example, someone with adequate finances may be expected to help pay their less-fortunate sibling's children's school fees. Failing to uphold ties with one's family is considered rebellious. This collectivistic attitude is also evident among friends. Underlying friendship is the notion of reciprocity and willingness to share with one another. When a friend asks for a favour or assistance, one is expected to provide it."", 'Kenyans generally do not find the idea of living alone very desirable, and having a high level of privacy is not highly valued. A tradition in some ethnic groups known as ‘baraza’ (a community meeting in which everyone is invited to speak) reflects the communal nature of Kenya’s society. On the local level, Kenyans deeply respect one’s right to speak and will be patient in allowing someone to express themselves. In turn, talking over someone, cutting in or otherwise depriving someone the opportunity to speak is frowned upon. Kenyans also tend to be warm and friendly when interacting with others. Indeed, it is common to hear laughter during conversations.', '_____________________', '1 UNHCR, 2018']"

Nevertheless, the diversity of beliefs, cuisines, festivals and languages is a source of pride.', 'Ethnicity and Social Stratification', 'Discerning the ethnic composition of Mauritius is complex, partly because the country has not gathered data on ', 'ethnicity', ' in its national census since 1972. There is no recorded indigenous population on the islands. Rather, Mauritius’ ethnic composition is a product of over two centuries of European colonialism and continued international labour migration, which is largely related to the sugarcane industry. Dutch colonialists established sugarcane plantations and then imported Madagascan slave workers. Following the Dutch, French colonialists settled on the land, who were succeeded by the British. The British replaced African slaves with Indian indentured labourers from other colonies.', 'Throughout Mauritian history, one’s ', 'ethnicity', ' was considered to infer their socioeconomic status.

For example, the company one works for, the car one drives and the food one buys are often governed by communal factors. There are various newspapers, books and films that cater to each ethnic group, such as newspapers in Mandarin and television programs in Hindi. However, such signifiers are becoming less effective at determining one’s background.', 'There are five broad ethnic categories: Franco-Mauritian, Sino-Mauritian, Indo-Mauritian, Afro-Mauritian and Creole-Mauritian.

The first Chinese migrants to Mauritius arrived in the late 1700s as mainly skilled labourers. Many of these migrants later established their own businesses. Those of Chinese heritage tend to be in the middle class. Many Sino-Mauritians continue to have a near monopoly on self-owned and -operated retail stores and larger import-export trade companies. Sino-Mauritians are often seen as clever and hardworking. There are now a large number of doctors, lawyers and other professionals among them.', 'Indo-Mauritian', 'Indo-Mauritians trace their heritage back to indentured labourers from the Indian subcontinent.

Their language, culture and ethnic origin reflects the interactions between the European settlers and African slaves. While in contemporary times they typically work as teachers, civil servants or manual labourers outside of agriculture, they continue to be in the lower end of the socioeconomic spectrum. At times, Afro-Mauritians may be referred to as ‘Creole’.', 'Creole-Mauritian', 'The term ‘Creole’ is often used to describe Mauritians who have mixed ', 'ethnicity', '. Typically, their heritage is part African and part European. Most Mauritians who have migrated to Australia since the 1960s have been Creole.', 'Language', 'There is no generally accepted official language in Mauritius; however, the vast majority of Mauritians speak Kreol (86.5%). The Kreol language is a mix of African and Asian languages, with influences from French. The majority of the population understands Kreol, making the language the ', 'lingua franca', ' of the country. However, there is no agreed-upon written form of Kreol, thus making it difficult to adopt Kreol as the official national language.', 'Various languages are used in day-to-day practice depending on the task at hand. As such, people tend to associate each language with different aspects of society. For example, English is related to education, law and administration while French is often connected to the media. Indeed, most newspapers are published in French. The French language has also had a significant impact on manners. It is common for people to exchange a ', '‘Bonjour’', ' (‘Hello’) in a shop or ', '‘Bonne\xa0journee’ ', '(‘Have a good day’) when leaving. Many also speak the language of their ancestry (for example, some Indo-Mauritians can speak Bhojpuri). The popularity of Bollywood films also means that many – both within and outside the Indian community – understand some Hindi. Due to the multilingual nature of Mauritius, people may switch frequently between languages.', 'Conversations about languages occur often in contemporary political and social debate. This is in part because language is thought to be an essential part of group identity for different ethnicities. Discussions vary depending on the ethnic group and language. However, on the whole, Kreol is thought to be one of the unifying characteristics of Mauritius. This is mainly because most Mauritians speak the language irrespective of their ', 'ethnicity', ', religion and socioeconomic class. The increased use of Kreol by non-Creole Mauritians reflects a broader trend of people moving away from ethnically based language use. Indeed, younger Mauritians typically speak Kreol rather than the language of their older relatives.', 'Communalism and Identity', 'Ethnicity', ', religion and language shape the way Mauritians relate to each other in the country’s ', 'multicultural', ' society.

This ', 'communalism', ' can be understood through the distinction between ', '‘noubann’ ', 'and', ' ‘zotbann’.', ' Noubann is a Kreol word that combines ', '‘nou’ ', '(which means ‘us’) and ', '‘bann’', ' (which means ‘group’). Conversely, zotbann stands for ', '‘zot’ ', '(them) and ', '‘bann’ ', '(group). For many Mauritians, their noubann is their ethnic group while zotbann are those from a different ethnic community.', 'The noubann-zotbann distinction is reflected in the Kreol saying, ', '“sak\xa0zako bizin protez so\xa0montan” ', ""(‘each monkey must protect his own mountain'). This reflects the in-group/out-group mentality of putting members of one's ethnic group before others. Some may also create and perpetuate communal stereotypes of their compatriots. This can result in strengthening noubann-zotbann distinctions between each community. Generational differences also contribute to perceptions of each community. However, while disruptions occur occasionally, Mauritians live in relative "", 'harmony', '. Most people accept and tolerate one another as well as embrace cultural differences.', ""Many Mauritians feel the need to maintain their ethnic identity and distinctiveness from other communities through preserving their traditions and memories of their ancestors.

With the interactions of the various ethnic groups over Mauritius’ long history, the various cultures have come to shape each other."", 'Indeed, many recognise a need for national unity. During sporting events and political rallies, Mauritians will often chant the slogan ""only one people, only one nation"" in Kreol. With modernisation and globalisation, many younger Mauritians are beginning to develop a common culture and outlook on life. Greater access to education and Western media has altered previous perceptions. People are also becoming more technologically connected, and the sense of being Mauritian is beginning to outweigh ancestral ties and divisive ', 'communalism', '. For example, inter-ethnic marriage is becoming more common among the younger generations. Thus, through a common language (Kreol) and societal changes, there is a growing unity among the Mauritian people.', 'Modesty and Warmth', 'Mauritians tend to be conservative, modest and reserved. The term ', '‘suavaze’', ' (‘savage’) refers to a person who is acting inappropriately – for example, being too bold, dressing immodestly, smoking in public or speaking too loudly. At times, this adherence to social expectations of modesty may come across as being aloof. However, Mauritians are quick to warm up. Indeed, among friends, family and acquaintances, Mauritians are friendly, welcoming and accepting.', 'One manifestation of the warmth and playfulness of Mauritians is their artistic expression. Perhaps the most common form of expression is the ', 'séga', ', a popular folk dance consisting of movements of the hips and arms to a rhythmic beat. The origins of the dance can be traced back to the African slaves who came to the country during the colonial era.

The majority of the population are ethnically Somali and can trace their ', 'genealogy', ' back to common forefathers. Somalis are distinguished by their traditional ', 'clan', ' system, Somali language and Sunni Islamic beliefs.1 Daily life and culture can differ significantly across Somalia as many regions experience varying levels of poverty, governance and safety. Widespread and prolonged displacement has also contributed to diverse understandings of Somali culture. For example, many displaced people and refugees rely on abstract ideas of the Somali identity as they have few or no personal memories of their homeland. Nevertheless, there are certain values that are characteristic to Somalis, these being generosity, hospitality, ', 'kinship', ', respect for the elderly and honour. Broadly, Somalis have also demonstrated a high level of adaptability and entrepreneurialism in the face of adversity.', 'The Somali Identity', 'The entire Somali population and land area was separated between five countries during the colonial period – British Somaliland, Italian Somaliland, French Somaliland, Ethiopia and Kenya. The present-day Republic of Somalia was formed when British and Italian Somaliland were united as an independent state in 1960. However, significant numbers of ethnic Somalis continue to reside in the regions they have historically inhabited across the Horn of Africa which now belong to the countries of Djibouti (former French Somaliland), the Ogaden region of Ethiopia and northeastern Kenya.', 'Since independence, Somali nationalism has been largely based on the idea that Somalis across all these regions share a common language, religion, culture and ', 'ethnicity', ', and hence are united under a single identity. For example, Somalia’s flag is an ethnic flag that has a star with five points to represent the unity of the\xa0Somali people inhabiting the five territories.2 Somalia fought a very damaging war against Ethiopia (1977-1978) in an effort to reclaim the territory of the predominantly Somali Ogaden region. The goal of uniting Somali territories has become a lower priority since the civil war (see ', 'Somali Civil War', '\xa0below). Nonetheless, Somalis from neighbouring countries are generally treated as citizens rather than foreigners when they visit.', 'Traditional Lifestyles, Displacement and Urbanisation', 'The Somali people are\xa0traditionally semi-nomadic, having lived subsistence lifestyles as agro-pastoralists or nomadic livestock herders. Somali\xa0nomads typically live in domed structures (', 'agal', ') made of branches, mats and/or animal skins that can easily be taken down and moved to another area. However, many people’s mode of living has been disrupted over recent decades. The cultural lives of many Somalis have been significantly impacted by the turmoil of the past 30 years.', 'It is estimated over 2 million Somalis are internally displaced within the country, and almost a million refugees are hosted in the region.3 In addition to conflict, many pastoralists and farmers have been displaced by famine and drought and have had to give up their livelihood and lifestyle, moving to refugee camps or urban areas. In 2014, the UN Population Fund estimated that 42% of the Somali population resided in urban areas, 26% were nomadic, 23% lived rurally and 9% were internally displaced.4', 'Despite what mass displacement may suggest, many Somalis are very educated, urbanised, well-travelled and familiar with industrialised environments. The coastal cities have tended to absorb global influences from the colonial period and international trade. While those from the interior of the country are less likely to have experienced such international exposure, many displaced people are also introduced to infrastructure and modern industrial functions during their time in refugee camps or urban areas. People who are located in the more well-established and organised refugee camps sometimes have the ability to further their education and skill set.', 'Social Structure and Clan System', 'One’s ', 'genealogy', ' is a defining factor in Somali culture. Society is characterised by a large extended family ', 'clan', ' system. Membership to clans is determined by paternal lineage (through the father). People can trace their lineage back for generations and are generally able to determine how they are related to a person, how they should address them and pay respect to them, simply from learning their name and ', 'clan', ' membership.', 'There are four major clans in Somalia ', '(Darod, Hawiye, Dir', ' and ', 'Rahaweyn)', ' and a number of medium-to-small groups. Each ', 'clan', ' can be further divided into numerous sub-clans that can consist of tens of thousands of people alone. Within these sub-clans, there are even more group divisions based on ', 'kinship', ' alliances of smaller extended families. The group divisions within the ', 'clan', ' system are not necessarily based on geographic differences. It is common for a variety of sub-clans to live within the same area.5', 'The Role of Elders', 'Elders play a very important role in Somali society and everyday life. They are negotiators, mediators and counsellors. They can also act as ', 'clan', ' representatives. Somalis generally seek advice from a community elder about an issue before any further course of action. Being an elder is more closely linked to a person’s status and authority rather than their actual age. For example, ', 'clan', ' chiefs (', 'aqal', ') and religious leaders are considered elders due to their authority, regardless of how old they are.', 'The power and authority elders hold has been immensely important in upholding law and order in areas of Somalia that do not have functioning governments. When an incident occurs, elders sit together and try to resolve the issue with a decision that de-escalates the situation non-violently. Indeed, in some regions where there is a strong respect for customary law, elders’ decisions reached under a tree in a rural area can carry the strength of law.', 'The observance and enforcement of elder’s’ decision-making depends on respect for their traditional authority. Nevertheless, generally all Somalis continue to have a deep respect for age and experience. Elders continue to be the first point of contact for many living overseas to work through personal problems.', 'Tribalism and Nationalism', 'Clan', ' loyalty is traditionally very strong and deep-rooted in Somalia.

For example, people are likely to side with members of their own kin-group in any dispute with other Somalis. However, such alliances and coalitions can change at short notice depending on the context. This is summed up in the Somali proverb: “', 'Me and my nation against the world. Me and my clan against my nation. Me and my family against the clan. Me and my brother against the family. Me against my brother.', '”', 'The Somali people tend to unite whenever faced with the threat of foreign interference. This overarching national allegiance has been formed through repeated confrontations with outsiders and a history of colonial resistance.8 The population suffered under colonialism and many still have bitter feelings about the era. The involvement of some international powers in Somali internal politics is also a source of resentment; foreign assistance is often seen as having political motives. Today, social attitudes are often strongly opposed to outside interference. The Somali people generally reject hierarchical authority and seek independence from controlling bodies.', 'Somali Civil War', 'It is important to understand the political history of Somalia as the events and hardships of the past few decades have drastically changed Somali society and shaped the ', 'diaspora', ' living overseas. Somalia was ruled by General Mohammad Siyad Barre for 22 years from 1969 until 1991. His regime was characterised by corruption, ', 'nepotism', ' and the progressive building of inter-', 'clan', ' tension. Barre attempted to reorder society and end tribal/', 'clan', ' institutions by declaring the country a socialist state.9 However, many rejected the centralised state authority. There were several internal conflicts between government forces and various armed rebel groups. Civil war broke out as clans rebelled and Barre’s regime collapsed in 1991.', 'Many (if not most) Somalis currently living in other countries fled Somalia during or after the outbreak of the civil war. Over the years, the country’s political infrastructure completely collapsed and the political violence turned into ', 'clan', '-based violence perpetrated on and by ordinary citizens. This broke down mutual trust throughout society on a large scale.10 Killings, lootings, sexual violence and the destruction of property led to large numbers of internally displaced people within the country, and to refugees fleeing to neighbouring countries. Famine and drought have also contributed to widespread poverty and displacement.', 'Political Sensitivities', 'Somalia’s political history may be a sensitive issue for many, particularly for those who were displaced. Every Somali family is likely to have their own personal experiences of the civil war. The role of ', 'clan', ' politics is particularly complicated and controversial. When the government collapsed, clans became the organising units of conflict with people splitting into factions. There are varying opinions and accounts of the truth. Therefore, be cautious forming opinions on ', 'clan', ' dynamics as you may be perceived as taking sides without having a full understanding of the situation.', 'Many Somalis may consider the ', 'clan', ' system to be divisive and problematic and prefer not to discuss it at all. Some argue that ', 'clan', ' rivalries are exaggerated by politicians and the media to be a bigger issue than they are, and do not have as much social relevance outside of politics. People may prefer to emphasise the unity of all Somalis in an effort to promote stability. This is particularly common among Somali ', 'diaspora', ' living overseas who generally view themselves as a single conglomerate. Many people have also intermarried between different clans. Ultimately, one should not allow ', 'clan', ' politics to inform opinions of other people as generalised knowledge and information on clans are becoming less relevant to understanding the average Somali.', 'Contemporary Challenges', 'Somalia did not have an effective government for over 20 years after the outbreak of civil war in 1991. The first formal federal government was formed in 2012 and a president was democratically elected in 2017. While this election was tarnished by corruption, it has still been hailed as a milestone towards stability. However, Somalia continues to face challenges. The prolonged lack of a functioning national government contributed to instability in the region, allowing the civil war to evolve into a jihadist battlespace. The Islamic jihadist terrorist group Al-Shabaab controls large parts of south-central Somalia and carries out high-profile attacks in the capital and elsewhere. Famine and drought also continue to be the biggest causes of displacement throughout the country.11', 'Today, the strength of law and order in Somalia differs between regions. In 1991, the northern state of Somaliland (formerly British Somaliland) self-declared as an independent breakaway republic. This region has not been as directly affected by the war in southern Somalia. However, its current declaration of independence is not internationally recognised. Somalia also has five autonomous regions that have created their own political institutions in part to secure peace from ', 'clan', ' rivalries – Puntland, Galmudug, Jubaland, South West Somalia and Hirshabelle. Unlike the secessionist region of Somaliland, these regions are not trying to gain international recognition as separate nations. Meanwhile, south-central Somalia continues to suffer the most from ', 'clan', '-based violence and Islamic insurgencies. The majority of internally displaced people reside in camps in south-central Somalia, including around one-third in the region surrounding the capital of Mogadishu.12', 'Minorities', 'Occupational Castes', 'There are some occupational caste groups in Somalia who are minority groups within their tribes, such as the Gaboye, Tumal and Yibir people. These groups are known as ‘midgaan’ and are treated as social outcasts in Somalia. They are discriminated against in all levels of society, unable to marry other Somalis and face a higher risk of violence. For these people, settlement as refugees overseas can be a very empowering experience as they are able to gain equal rights that they were previously denied.', 'Minority Ethnicities', 'There are also some minority ethnic groups who are not part of the Somali genealogical clans, but have been living in Somalia for centuries.13 These include the Somali Bantu, Bajun, Barawani and Hamari people. Little statistical information is available on minority groups in Somalia. However, it is believed that there is a higher concentration of minorities in south-central Somalia. They are interspersed throughout society and do not have the political representation and military organisation that the majority Somali clans have.14 The Somali Bantu are the largest ethnic minority, and tend to face more social barriers than other groups such as the Barawani and Hamari. Credible sources indicate that many internally displaced peoples in south-central Somalia are Bantu.15', 'Honour (Sharaf)', 'The notion of honour ', '(sharaf) ', 'is central to Somali culture. Personal honour is deeply intertwined with family reputation in Somalia, regardless of wealth or power. Traditionally, one’s behaviour would affect the honour or reputation of the entire ', 'clan', ' or community. This is still the case for some tribes in rural areas, while in urban areas it has changed to be reflective of the family alone. People’s awareness of their personal honour informs their sense of pride and integrity, and tends to guide behaviour and interactions in almost all circumstances.', 'One’s honour is linked to an individual’s personal demeanour, treatment of others, honesty and modesty ', '(xishood) ', '– specifically, the sexual modesty of one’s female family members. These reflect many Islamic principles. If a woman is perceived to be promiscuous, her family name is put to shame. In some conservative communities, the unproven suspicion of a woman’s infidelity can cause enough disgrace to ruin her family’s reputation.', 'However, a person’s honour is determined by more than their sexual modesty. Respectability and character are also reflected in the way people dress, the language they use, the hospitality they show their friends, the respect they give the elderly and their general demeanour. By remaining conservative, modest and respectable in all these aspects, one is thought to have proper decorum. It is important to note that the expectations and standards of behaviour are different for men and women. Generally, women are subject to higher expectations of social compliance than men. For example, it would be seen as uncivilised for girls to laugh or speak loudly in public whereas the same behaviour would be less inappropriate for men.', 'Community Interdependence', 'There is a very strong community focus embedded in Somali culture. People are mutually reliant on their family and community for support meeting essential needs. Dependence upon kin has become particularly crucial to survival since the civil war. The government’s capacity to provide basic services or respond to humanitarian or conflict-related disasters is low.16 Therefore, Somalis rely on their kin to provide food, protection and conflict resolution. Everything is always redistributed and shared among the community, from engagement money to compensation money. One’s community also takes responsibility for an individual’s actions. For example, if a person commits an offence, traditionally it is their kin group that is held responsible and must pay compensation.', 'Generosity', 'Generosity is a core value of Somali culture that people extend towards the broader community and public rather than limit to their immediate community or family. Somalis find dignity in being helpful, hospitable and charitable to others with everything (money, food, time, personal connections, etc.). Hence, individuals may also receive social, emotional and financial support from the broader Somali community and public when going through particular hardship. Local mosques also often play a key role in mobilising community support.', 'Some Somalis report that they feel spontaneous generosity is more common in Somalia, such as a stranger paying for someone’s food without telling them. Somalis tend not to think conservatively about the future, but rather give what they can to others at the present moment. Therefore, people can often rely on the hospitality of strangers. For instance, a person may be able to travel long distances across Somalia without comprehensive provisions as they will be taken care of by the strangers they come across on their journey.', 'Social Life', 'The community focus of Somalia gives the culture a strong social dimension. For example, Somali men may be able to maintain a healthy social life simply by sitting at tea shops on popular streets, watching locals and waiting to be spoken to by those passing. Meanwhile, women often make spontaneous visits to their neighbours and friends. It is common for people to meet friends without having to organise to do so. Generally, people tend to be very social, friendly and open.', 'Rather than having ‘acquaintances’, Somalis generally see everyone as their friends. Once a Somali has met somebody, they are usually prepared to open up their homes and lives to that person, and help them in times of need. It is similarly expected that the person would be willing to do so in return. This quick development of personal relationships can be very different from Western notions of privacy. Sometimes their openness to conversation can come across as quite direct or bold to those from the English-speaking West. For example, it is normal for a Somali to approach a stranger for a chat. Many Somalis report that they miss this aspect of their culture whilst living overseas. They often describe how strangers in Somalia are met with a very welcoming and open attitude that they do not necessarily experience in Western countries.', '_____________________', '1 Elmi, 20162 Central Intelligence Agency, 2018\xa03 World Vision, 20184 Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, 20175 Lewis, 2004\xa06 Barnes, 2006\xa07 Bradbury & Healy, 20108 UNHCR, 20169 Proquest, 201710 UNHCR, 201611 Asylum Research Consultancy, 201812 Asylum Research Consultancy, 201813 Proquest, 2017; UNHCR, 201614 Minority Rights Group International, 201915 Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, 201716 Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, 2017']"

Most South Sudanese people share a cultural connection based on their common practice of Christianity, and the experience of struggle and liberation from North Sudan. However, the South Sudanese tend to feel more cultural affiliation and loyalty to their tribal and ethnic groups rather than allegiance to the nation.', 'Despite its recent secession, the country continues to face serious civil unrest and endemic violence. Almost two million people have been internally displaced since the outbreak of civil war in 2013.1 The cultural lives of many South Sudanese have been deeply altered by the effects of conflict.

However, it is essential to recognise that there is no uniform understanding of the typical South Sudanese experience. Many people have shared the difficulty of unremitting war, displacement and survival. However, individuals’ experiences diverge depending on which period of wartime they were caught in and when they left the country. Each armed conflict and civil war within the region has been different in nature, leading to fundamentally different experiences. Furthermore, not all South Sudanese have come from the centre of conflicts. Many Southern Sudanese people that have fled their country may not have had direct contact with violent behaviour.', 'Prolonged experiences of displacement can affect the practice of culture and traditions. Some people may have spent years in exile, involuntarily displaced to surrounding countries such as Egypt, Kenya, Uganda and Ethiopia. In these cases, many reside in the marginalising and uncertain conditions of refugee camps or have joined the urban poor in major cities. Others may have also been forced to hide within the country, living nomadically to avoid attacks from the army. Meanwhile, a large number of Southerners that had lived in Khartoum (the capital of North Sudan) moved to South Sudan expecting a new life after its independence, and now face double displacement trying to return to their homes in North Sudan where they are no longer citizens.', 'Additionally, whilst the majority of people currently living in South Sudan have rural subsistence lifestyles, not all people belonging to the South Sudanese ', 'diaspora', ' share this cultural background. In fact, many people who identify as South Sudanese are very educated, urbanised and familiar with industrialised environments.

South Sudan is economically impoverished despite having rich natural resources. It has limited infrastructure, much of which has been damaged from fighting. Roads are mostly unsealed, vehicles are rare, and many people barter rather than using currency. It is estimated roughly 80% of the population lives in rural areas.3 In these rural areas, people may be unfamiliar with modern-day utilities and technologies, such as shopping malls and escalators.', 'It is normal for South Sudanese people to be bilingual or trilingual. English is the official language of the country and remains the preferred language in business relations and among the educated. It is also common for people to communicate in standard Arabic or Juba Arabic in urban areas (as this was the dominant language of Sudan before the country split). Furthermore, most South Sudanese also speak the local language or dialect of their ', 'ethnicity', '/tribe. There are more than a hundred local languages, many of which diverge from one another in accent or dialect.', 'Ethnic and Tribal Diversity', 'South Sudan is incredibly diverse with over 60 different ethnic groups. Anthropologists have traditionally categorised the peoples and tribes of South Sudan under six distinct groupings. The majority of the South Sudanese population are defined as ', 'Nilotic', ', meaning their tribal origins trace back to the White Nile. Other groupings include Central ', 'Sudanic', ', ', 'Nilo – Hamid', ', ', 'Bari-speaking', ', ', 'Zande', ' and ', 'Anyuak', ' people. Each of these are defined by a host of ethnic, historical and linguistic factors.', 'The ', 'Dinka', ' (a Nilotic people) are the biggest ethnic group in South Sudan, forming approximately 35.8% of the population according to 2011 estimates.4 The ', 'Nuer', ' (also Nilotic) is the second biggest ethnic group (15.6%). Other ethnicities or tribes include the ', 'Shilluk (Chollo), Luo, Bari, Azande, Anuak, Murle, Kuku, Kakwa, Mandari, Murle, Ndogom Lndi, Lango, Didinga, Dungatona, Acholi, Baka, Fertit, Bviri, Kreish, Bongo, Jiek\xa0', 'and ', 'Nuba', '.', 'Within each ethnic group, there are further subdivisions. For example, the Dinka people are divided into at least 25 ethnic subgroups that each have their own distinct cultural practices, dialects and traditions. Smaller Dinka tribes include the ', 'Dinka Malual, Twic, Rek, Ruweng, Bor, Agar, Atwot and Ngok Ablinug', '.', 'From this brief overview, one can appreciate that the social landscape of South Sudan is exceptionally diverse. It is not possible to give a comprehensive description of each tribe, its subgroups and their different cultural, religious and linguistic identities in the scope of this profile. Therefore, it is important to recognise that all descriptions of a mainstream ‘South Sudanese culture’ are subject to variances between tribes and ethnicities. Such distinctions are particularly visible when looking at the livelihoods, customary laws, marriage systems and everyday objects of different ethnic groups.', 'Tribal Lifestyles', 'Many people belonging to the broad South Sudanese ', 'diaspora', ' across the world have been raised in cities or refugee camps under different circumstances and lifestyles. Therefore, many have been influenced by the cultural customs of host countries and not all follow traditional tribal practices. However, in South Sudan itself, the majority of the population live traditional subsistence lifestyles that are particular to their ethnic group. These livelihoods are usually centred on cattle herding or agricultural productions that vary season to season. Cattle-herding communities are often semi-nomadic, such as the Dinka and Nuer. Meanwhile, agriculturalists tend to remain in a specific territory; these are generally tribes belonging to Zande, Fertit, Anyuak, Shilluk, Maridi ethnic groups and Bari-speaking tribes.', 'Traditional tribal social structures and customary law form the basis of most rural communities’ social organisation. According to the UN Population Fund, more than 90% of criminal and civil matters in South Sudan are determined through customary law.5 The purpose of customary law is “to achieve reconciliation and to ensure community ', 'harmony', ' rather than to punish”.6 Through this legal system, individuals exercise social and legal powers at the local level. The rules surrounding marriage, divorce and child custody are matters of the home, not the state. The government is generally not involved in enforcing laws or punishment. Rather, most matters are resolved and circumscribed within communities through tribal courts.', 'Exact laws are difficult to specify as they differ between tribes. There may be some general commonalities across groups with similar livelihoods. For example, among cattle herders, reparations will usually be made through the currency of cattle. Meanwhile, for agriculturalists, exchanges can vary between tools, manual labour, weapons, beads or cash, for example. These differences in currency can make negotiations across ethnic lines complex. For instance, the terms and conditions of dowries can be difficult to negotiate depending on the customary law of the bride and groom’s tribe (see ', 'Marriage Practices', ' under the ', 'Family', ' section). Furthermore, tribal social structures are constantly undergoing change. Communities have had to be incredibly dynamic, adapting under the pressures of conflict. As another example, years of conflict and extreme poverty have brought more focus on dowry and early marriage as economic measures for survival. As such, some of the traditional customs surrounding these practices have changed in a short amount of time.', 'Relations Between Ethnicities and Tribes', 'Rivalry between tribes can occur over resources or territory. However, these disagreements are not generally ethnically charged as they often happen within ethnicities (i.e. between two Dinka tribes). For example, cattle raids are a serious threat for many tribes living in rural areas. This is an event in which a neighbouring tribe ambushes a community to take their livestock and resources. Due to the widespread availability of weapons, these violent encounters are often deadly. In the event of a cattle raid, the tribe that gets attacked usually seeks reprisal. Though these events can develop into tribal feuds and resource conflicts, they are generally detached from the broader ethnic conflict occurring in politics and are particular to local areas.', 'The people of South Sudan tend to feel a stronger sense of belonging to their tribe or ethnic group before identifying as citizens of the sovereign state. During the years of civil war with North Sudan, many ethnicities and tribes were able to set aside their differences in order to unite to fight for independence. There was a lot of hope and excitement among the broader South Sudanese community when the country gained independence in 2011. However, when conflict erupted in 2013 over competition for political power over the newly formed country, community opinion became divided again.', 'It is important to understand that although the current civil war has an ethnic undertone, this does not reflect the attitudes of all South Sudanese. People generally treat each other equally, unless they are politically involved individuals (i.e. members of the army) or live in the specific regions affected by violence. For South Sudanese living in host countries, some people may boycott the community events of another ', 'ethnicity', '; however, this kind of behaviour remains on a political level. Day-to-day ethnic relations are usually diplomatic and harmonious as most South Sudanese seek peace. Indeed, South Sudanese people living in other countries are commonly open and united across ethnic backgrounds. People may share their tribe’s songs and dances with other South Sudanese ethnicities to build broader community spirit and solidarity. It is also worth noting that the younger generation is usually detached from the conflict and has become instrumental in developing a united image of the South Sudanese community.', 'Heritage', 'One’s heritage remains crucial to most South Sudanese people’s concept of personal identity. Many South Sudanese have an innate awareness of their ancestors that follows them throughout their life and keeps them grounded. Traditionally, there was a belief in the spiritual realm and the ability of ancestors to intervene among the living. Today, Christian churches in South Sudan generally frown upon ancestor worship and discourage people from calling on the spirits. Members of the South Sudanese ', 'diaspora', ' that live in cities or different countries usually have a strong belief in the Christian God that takes priority over their reverence for ancestors. However, some Sudanese people living mostly in rural areas have continued animist traditions (see more in ', 'Religion', ').', 'Pride in one’s heritage remains very important to all. This extends to those who have been living in exile or refugees that have moved to host countries. People usually have a strong knowledge of the tribe’s history and the exact place where they originated. Traditional dances and stories pass this heritage on from generation to generation. Indeed, music and dance (often to drumming) are central to maintaining cultural ties and binding communities together in times of celebration.', 'Many South Sudanese are growing worried that some aspects of their culture will not be preserved amidst the effects of war. Those living in refugee camps or otherwise in exile often do not have the opportunity to practise their traditions in their original form. Adolescent refugees commonly have to rely on information passed through their parents and other community members, having never visited their homeland. Nevertheless, people are encouraged to perform their traditional dances and songs in camps to keep their cultures alive.', 'History of Conflict', 'The relentless conflicts of the 20th and 21st century have produced a generation of South Sudanese who have scarcely been afforded peace. While not all South Sudanese have directly experienced violence, it helps to have an awareness of their country’s history to understand their perspectives and experiences. South Sudan was once part of Sudan, which was ruled under a joint colonial relationship between the United Kingdom and the Kingdom of Egypt. However, the cultures of the north and south were very different. The northern population was predominantly Muslim with an Arab cultural influence, speaking the Juba dialect of Arabic. Meanwhile, the populations of southern Sudan mostly followed tribal African cultural traditions and were strongly impacted by British imperialism, widely adopting Christianity and English. The ', 'colonisation', ' strategy attempted to patch these populations together as a single nation.', 'When the country gained independence in 1956, internal conflict quickly erupted as the northern Muslim leaders came to dominate the central government and many southern Sudanese leaders were removed from power. The south became culturally and religiously persecuted by the government, which implemented shari’a law and exploited their resources. As the southern Sudanese fought for political representation and autonomy, internal conflict became largely ethno-religiously based. South Sudan achieved independence from North Sudan in 2011 after millions of people were killed in two civil wars spanning decades.', 'The ethnicities and tribes of South Sudanese were largely bound together by a greater cause of independence in their struggle against the North Sudanese government. However, their problems were not properly resolved and they resurfaced in the state-building process after independence was achieved. Ethnic conflict erupted in 2013 and violence is ongoing today. At least 50,000 people have been killed in this current civil war and millions have been displaced. Evidence suggests that the death toll may be far higher than this estimate. From this brief summary, one can appreciate that decades of conflict have given rise to cultural resilience, but also national exhaustion.', 'Community Interdependence and Privacy', 'The Southern Sudanese people’s experience of domination by both British/Egyptian colonisers and the Arab Muslim Sudanese government has led them to value independence, ', 'self-determination', ' and autonomy. Public attitudes have become strongly opposed to outside interference and controlling bodies. People seek to protect the right to have control over their lives and for the state not to interfere with their communities’ affairs. For many South Sudanese, their tribal customary law reflects much of what they fought to protect in civil war against the north as it allows communities to manage their own activities (see ', 'Tribal Lifestyles', ' above).', 'Ultimately, community ', 'interdependence', ' is an aspect of life that is important to all South Sudanese. The culture is very collectivistic as reliance on kin and community has been crucial to survival. There is a broad mistrust of government involvement in people’s personal lives, exacerbated by the underfunded social services that are often unable to meet basic needs due to corruption or lack of security. Therefore, if a South Sudanese person is in crisis and essential needs must be met, they are likely to use personal avenues to resolve the problem. By solving problems internally within the community, people can generally avoid the intervention of outsiders.', 'The communal aspect of South Sudanese culture often means that people rarely seek objective analysis into their personal situations. Individuals tend to approach those who know them first, starting at their most immediate family members and extended relatives or friends. Tribal leaders or community leaders will eventually be consulted if the issue cannot be resolved. Their advice is usually preferred over a counsellor and sensitive information is rarely shared with strangers, such as officials or practitioners. This code of privacy is also important to preserve the honourable reputation of a family. People tend not to reveal their problems to the public to safeguard their family name against judgement from the community. For example, parents are unlikely to reveal the fact that their child is receiving bad grades at school.', 'Dealing with Challenges and Confrontation', 'The privacy of the South Sudanese community can sometimes mean that some people do not speak up when they are having difficulty. Individuals may accept unjust situations or challenging circumstances to avoid causing community gossip by raising their voice. Many are becoming more aware of their civil and workplace rights. However, some people may not report their mistreatment due to mistrust of the system, or fear that doing so will make their situation worse. This leads some South Sudanese to be compliant to the point that they are put at a disadvantage.', 'Some people among the South Sudanese community may be quick to anger at one another. However, they generally rarely hold grudges. This aspect of the culture is important to understand as it differs from the English-speaking West. For example, in Western cultures, confrontations often signify the beginning or culmination of a long-standing dispute and may affect people’s long-term relationship henceforth. However, in South Sudan, fights are often seen as the final action that puts an end to a disagreement. At its conclusion, the matter is generally thought to be resolved, and anger dissipates fairly quickly with both parties leaving with no hard feelings. Sometimes a quarrel can involve physical confrontation. However, even in this case, the long-term repercussions are usually minimal. People generally revert to being friendly and pleasant with each other, without any underlying awkwardness or animosity the next day. Therefore, it is important for foreigners to understand that though some South Sudanese may appear to have a quick temper, the effects of such behaviour on interpersonal relationships are interpreted differently in the South Sudanese community.', 'Age and Respect', 'Age determines the social ', 'hierarchy', ' as it is associated with wisdom in South Sudanese culture. The older one is, the more respect they expect to receive from their peers and the community. To be an elder is to be allowed into high-level community meetings, make decisions, go hunting and perform certain cultural practices. As one’s old age signifies a higher social status, being called ‘old’ is a compliment and a point of pride in South Sudan.', 'However, most people born in South Sudan do not know their exact age or birthday. Often they will have knowledge of an event that happened the year they were born, and will estimate their age from there. For example, one may know that their family suffered from a bad drought during the year they were born, and will correlate their age to that life event recorded in history.', 'Perceptions of youth and adulthood are more fluid in South Sudan. People do not have a fixed age at which they become legal adults (as is normally the case at 18 years of age in Western culture). Rather, a person becomes a young adult once they have been initiated with a rite of passage. This can occur anytime around puberty, but usually when they are 15 or 16 years old. Initiations vary between ethnicities. For example, boys may be circumcised, girls may be tattooed, or both may receive scarification (decorative cuts). Once a child has been initiated as a young adult, they may take on more responsibility. However, one is only considered a full adult once they get married.', '_____________________', '1 IDMC, 20162 Central Intelligence Agency, 20203 Central Intelligence Agency, 20204 Central Intelligence Agency, 20205 United Nations Population Fund, 20116 Jok, Leitch & Vendewint, 2004']"

The territory of Sudan previously incorporated South Sudan. However, the countries split in 2011 following decades of civil war. The North Sudanese identity is closely associated with Muslim and Arab cultural traditions, as these are factors that differentiate the population from the South Sudanese. The people of North Sudan are generally considered to be very modest, humble and stoic. They also share certain cultural values, such as a sense of duty to support their community and be hospitable. While this profile will mostly describe the Sudanese Arabic-speaking majority, it is important to recognise that all descriptions of a mainstream ‘Sudanese culture’ are subject to variances between tribal and ethnic groups. The Sudanese population is very culturally diverse, containing highly differentiated lifestyles, livelihoods and ancestral backgrounds.', 'Sudanese Arabs', 'The term “Arab” in Sudan has come to describe a cultural affiliation on the basis of being an Arabic-speaking Muslim. The majority of the Sudanese population identify as Arabs in this way. However, most are ethnically mixed (often descending from both Arab and African tribes) and have Cushitic ancestry. Indeed, many Sudanese Arabs know what their family’s original local language was before they started speaking Arabic, providing a linguistic link to their tribal heritage and ethnic ancestry. Due to the blended ', 'genealogy', ' of most Sudanese Arabs, they may be physically indistinguishable from those who would consider themselves more ‘African’ or non-Arab.', 'Historically, Arabs were divided into tribes and sub-tribes on the basis of people’s descent from common ancestors. The traditional livelihoods of tribes were usually centred on agricultural production or nomadic livestock herding. These traditional lifestyles\xa0have been dismantled in most cities.\xa0However, they continue in some rural areas and settled villages. Agriculturalist tribes tend to remain in a specific territory, usually along the central Nile River (commonly known as Riverine Arabs). Meanwhile, tribes whose lives centre on livestock rearing are generally pastoral nomads in the plains (known as the\xa0Bedouins\xa0or ‘', 'Badu', '’). Ultimately, Sudanese Arabs do not make up a homogeneous group. Today, the social landscape is so diverse that the term ‘Arab’ can be descriptive of both a cameleer in the plains and a businessman in the city.', 'Non-Arab Ethnicities', 'People who identify with a non-Arab ', 'ethnicity', ' are generally distinguishable by the fact that they speak a local language rather than Arabic. Those that live in the major cities commonly learn Arabic as a first or second language to facilitate inter-ethnic communication and business. However, outside of urban areas, many non-Arab tribes continue to maintain the traditional lifestyles and customs, living in regions that represent their traditional homelands.', 'There are many non-Arab ethnic groups in Sudan, the most well known being the Nubians, the Beja, the Fur, the Zaghawa and the Nuba. Within each ethnic group there are multiple tribes, amounting to over 500 sub-tribes in total.1 It is not possible to give a comprehensive description of each tribe, its subgroups and their different cultural, religious and linguistic identities in the scope of this profile. However, from this brief overview, one can appreciate that the social landscape of Sudan is very diverse.', 'The ancestry and religious practices of non-Arab ethnicities vary. Groups that originate from the northern and eastern regions of Sudan often have closer ancestry to Egyptians and Eritreans. They tend to have more “Middle Eastern” cultural customs and traditionally practise Islam (such as the Nubians and Beja people).2 A very general observation would be that the further away from the Nile one travels in Sudan, the more “African” the social demographic and customs of tribes become. Some African tribes have adopted Islam over time. For example, the Fur and Zaghawa people practise Islam while incorporating some traditions specific to their ', 'ethnicity', '.3 However, many African ethnic groups practise Christianity or follow a traditional animist religion instead. The vast majority of non-Muslim tribes live in the central Nuba mountains or the southern regions of Sudan, such as the Nuba and Acholi.4', 'Identity and Political History', ""To understand Sudanese culture, it is important to have a general knowledge of Sudan's political history and how events of the past century have affected the country. North Sudan and South Sudan were once ruled as a single country under a joint colonial relationship between the United Kingdom and Egypt. This period of colonial rule forced the population to see themselves as a unified nation, whereas previously people had been living in self-governing tribes. A strong Sudanese national identity was built and certain customs came to represent a unified idea of Sudanese culture. For example, the"", ' ‘tob’ ', '(a long wrap-around cloth) became recognisable as a standardised “Sudanese” cultural dress, whereas previously people had worn clothing specific to their tribe or ethnic group.', 'The common understanding of the ‘Sudanese national identity’ became informed by Islam and certain aspects of traditional Arab tribal culture. For example, much legislation became based in Muslim Shari’a law in 1989, embedding the religion in the country’s governance and political system (see the ', 'Religion', ' section). This occurred as part of a wave of ‘public morality’ that required women to wear modest clothing, regardless of their religious beliefs. The government also promoted a policy called Arabisation ', '(ta’rib)', ' that sought to make Arabic the standardised language across the country.5 This vision of the national identity did not resonate with the Christian African tribes of southern Sudan. Two civil wars occurred over 50 years as the southern tribes resisted the cultural and political dominance of the Sudanese Arab government. The southern population gained independence as ‘the Republic of South Sudan’ in 2011. You can learn about the South Sudanese country and profile ', 'here', '.', 'The North Sudanese people are arguably more homogeneous as a result of South Sudan’s secession, as the majority of the remaining population share the Arabic language, Islam and certain customs. However, most individuals still tend to think of themselves as belonging to a certain tribe first and foremost, and Sudanese second. The sense of Sudanese citizenship is arguably stronger among expatriates living in other countries.', 'The Darfur Crisis', 'In 2003, a serious conflict erupted in the westernmost region of Sudan (Darfur), leading to what has been described as “the world’s worst humanitarian crisis” by the United Nations (UN).6 To briefly summarise, the conflict has often been fought along ethnic lines between the Arab nomadic tribes and the African pastoralist tribes of the region. Members of the Arab nomadic tribes formed a militia (known as the ', 'Janjaweed)', ' that carried out large-scale attacks against the Darfur farmers, such as the Fur, Zaghawa and Massalit people. This has involved burning villages, systematic sexual abuse of women and children,7 and targeting the refugee camps where displaced people flee to.8 However, the conflict has also been perpetuated by a complex combination of environmental factors (i.e. drought and desertification), government involvement and international interests. The Sudanese government is widely believed to have supported and armed the militia and has also carried out its own airstrikes on the farming villages.9', 'The combined attacks have now been recognised as ethnic cleansing and genocide against the non-Arab pastoralist ethnicities of Darfur. The number of fatalities is undetermined and often disputed by the government, but is estimated to be many hundred of thousands.10,11 It is widely believed that the government planned the atrocities, with the Sudanese President wanted on an arrest warrant for crimes against humanity, war crimes and three counts of genocide by the International Criminal Court.12 Despite statements from Sudanese authorities that the conflict in Darfur is over, the US Department of State’s 2017 Human Rights Report states that violence is continuing.13', 'Displacement and Hardship', 'The long-term conflict in the region and surrounding countries has led to widespread displacement. There are over 3 million internally displaced people within Sudan, and over 600,000 Sudanese refugees in neighbouring countries.14 The country also hosts roughly 375,000 refugees from Ethiopia, Eritrea, Chad, the Central African Republic and South Sudan (arrivals of which have grown given the continued instability within South Sudan).15 The UN estimates that 2.6 million people had been displaced from the Darfur region between the start of the conflict in 2003 and 2016.16 Prolonged experiences of displacement can affect the practice of culture and traditions. Some people may have spent years or decades in exile, involuntarily displaced to surrounding countries. In these cases, many reside in the marginalising and uncertain conditions of refugee camps or have joined the urban poor in cities.', 'The majority of people living in Sudan face daily struggles as decades of conflict, corruption and dictatorship have created widespread poverty. Most of the population live in rural areas that lack substantial infrastructure and resources (estimated 76% in 2017).17 Many are affected by massive environmental challenges that have periodically caused famines. Life expectancy is low due to the effects of long-term conflict and poor access to health care. Therefore, consider that a person who has migrated from Sudan may have witnessed or experienced the effects of extreme poverty.', 'Social Hierarchies', 'Due to widespread poverty, social mobility between classes is generally limited in Sudan. The majority of the population belongs to the lower class, living in small rural villages or sprawling urban settlements surrounding cities. Only a small minority belong to the elite. This higher class generally consists of those with access to government contacts. They are often distinguishable by conspicuous displays of wealth (such as owning entire plots of land or wearing a lot of jewellery). There is a sizable ‘middle class’ in cities who are not necessarily part of the elite or the lower class. For example, they might be families that receive remittances from relatives overseas, but do not have steady employment of their own. Due to the lack of infrastructure and resources throughout Sudan, these understandings of the ‘middle class’ and ‘higher class’ are very different from what is the norm in Western countries.', 'Differences in wealth tend not to create much ', 'social stratification', ' or exclusion within Sudanese communities. For example, during the Islamic month of Ramadan, entire neighbourhoods will gather together to share a feast. People might notice that the food one family provides is more plentiful than another’s, but will not mention it to avoid any sense of embarrassment or exclusion.', 'Being rich or well-educated does not earn a person automatic respect. A person’s integrity, honour and treatment of others is thought to be far more important than their affluence or privilege in Sudan (see ', 'Honour (Sharaf)', ' below). There is a saying in Sudan that “knowing how to write doesn’t necessarily make you a good person”. Furthermore, one’s profession does not guarantee community respect. On a day-to-day level, the only factor that may give one automatic respect on the basis of their identity is age. Elders are almost always given the most deference and attention in social situations.', 'Interdependence and Community', 'There is a very strong community focus embedded in Sudanese culture. People are often mutually reliant on their relatives and neighbours. This is due to the collectivistic nature of the culture, as well as people’s sense of duty (', 'al-wajib', ""). There is a general understanding that with privilege comes a greater responsibility to care for the community. Therefore, those in more fortunate circumstances often feel an obligation to help those that are struggling. Even people in difficult financial circumstances will often look to assist those around them with what they can afford, despite having to attend to their own needs as well. Assistance is usually carried out discreetly to avoid bring attention towards the receiver's difficult position. For example, a community leader may visit the family of a widow in the middle of the night and give her some money. Neither are expected to mention the transaction again to protect the leader’s humility, and also the receiver's pride."", 'In some cases, whole neighbourhoods may be deeply involved in helping everyone collectively meet challenges. For example, when a family goes through a particular hardship (such as the death of a family member), it is customary for the entire community to rally together. Neighbours and friends will come to cook and clean for that family in order to give them time to mourn without the stress of daily activity. Sudanese families try not seclude themselves from one another as strong community networks help lighten everyone’s burdens. This dynamic often continues when people migrate to other countries.', 'Honour (Sharaf)', 'The notion of honour ', '(sharaf)', ' is central to Sudanese culture. People’s awareness of their personal honour tends to guide behaviour and interactions in almost all circumstances. Personal honour is deeply intertwined with family reputation in Sudan. Traditionally, one’s behaviour would affect the honour or reputation of the entire ', 'clan', '. This is still the case for some tribes in rural areas, while in urban areas it has changed to be reflective of the family alone.', 'There are many factors that can determine whether one is perceived to have honour. One’s honour is deeply linked to an individual’s personal demeanour, treatment of others, integrity and modesty – specifically, the sexual modesty of one’s female family members. The Public Order Law\xa0prohibits some offences of honour, reputation and public morality in regard to this.18 In some conservative communities, the unproven suspicion of a woman’s infidelity can cause enough disgrace to ruin her family’s reputation. If a woman is perceived to be promiscuous, her family name ', '(sumaat ahalak)', ' is put to shame ', '(aar).', 'Public disgrace\xa0can have extreme consequences. It can cause social exclusion and have very serious effects on people’s future opportunities and circumstances. Therefore,\xa0the public perception of a family’s honour can be more important than their social or monetary position in Sudan.\xa0There is often\xa0a strong cultural pressure on individuals to protect their reputation. In some serious cases, a family may feel obliged to shun the member of the household that brought shame upon them in order to clear their family name. Ultimately,\xa0much behaviour may be motivated by a fear of shame\xa0', '(aar) ', 'or guilt.', 'Politeness (Adab)', 'A person’s honour is determined by more than their sexual modesty. Respectability and character are also reflected in the way people dress, the language they use, the hospitality they show their friends, the respect they give the elderly and their general demeanour. By remaining conservative, modest and respectable in all these aspects, one is thought to have ‘', 'adab', '’ (', 'politeness', ' and manners). The direct meaning of adab is “the proper way to go about something”. It is important to note that the expectations and standards of adab are different for men and women. Generally, women have higher expectations of social compliance than men. For example, it would be seen as uncivilised for girls to laugh or speak loudly in public whereas the same behaviour would be less inappropriate for men.', 'Humility (Tawadae)', 'Humility ', '(tawadae)', ' is also a very important value in Sudan. Individuals tend to be very modest about their accomplishments. Indeed, successes are expected to make people become more humble. It is common to hear collective speech used to downplay achievements. For example, a Sudanese person may say “we completed it”, when in fact they did so single-handedly. This sets the Sudanese apart from many other Arab cultures where it is common to gain status by speaking openly of achievements and positive qualities. Most Sudanese tend to be modest about their educational and financial standings, sometimes preferring not to reveal these details.', 'Generosity and Hospitality', 'Generosity', ' (karim)', "" and hospitality are core Sudanese virtues, linked to people's’ honour. Dignity "", '(karama)', ' is found in being helpful, generous and charitable to others with everything (money, food, time, personal connections, etc.). People are often able to rely on the hospitality of strangers as the Sudanese feel an obligation to show hospitality. As an example of this embedded generosity, a person may be able to travel long distances in Sudan without comprehensive provisions.', 'The Sudanese people often feel a duty to offer everything they can to guests or friends. This reflects a certain kind of hospitality, known as ‘', 'diyafa’', ', that people are taught to practise from a young age. By the time most Sudanese reach adulthood, it is a quality that is second nature to them. Often individuals may offer their service or help as an expression of ', 'politeness', '. In Sudan, people usually read non-verbal cues and refuse these offers; for example, “I couldn’t possibly accept that from you”. After this initial refusal, if the person does not insist the offer upon their guest, it usually means that they weren’t really expecting the guest to accept. This is all a polite exchange.', 'It is important to understand ', 'diyafa', ' as it is often the source of many ', 'cross-cultural', ' miscommunications. For example, a Westerner may be overwhelmed by a Sudanese person’s generosity and accept the offer, unintentionally taking advantage of their ', 'politeness', '. A Sudanese person is unlikely to speak up (see ', 'Stoicism and Fatalism', ' below), and may end up going to great lengths to perform a favour that they meant to offer out of ', 'politeness', '. The Westerner may also be unaware that upon accepting this offer, there is an expectation that they repay the person with similar generosity at some point in the future.', 'Stoicism and Fatalism', 'The Sudanese are generally stoic people and private about their emotions. There is a dominant cultural norm that expects individuals to hide when they are in pain or struggling. Resilience, self-', 'restraint', ' and physical courage are admired. Therefore, people try to be as tough as possible when faced with difficult situations. This means it is often hard to detect when a Sudanese person has been emotionally hurt; they may not show their offence or upset in their facial expressions.', 'This aspect of Sudanese culture is related to a sense of ', 'fatalism', '. There is a common belief that all events are predetermined by God ', '(Allah)', '. Therefore, crying and complaining can be seen as an objection against God’s will or a lack of faith in his plan. In some cases, open displays of emotion can be discouraged. For example, there is a traditional cultural expectation that women do not scream when going through child labour. Similar standards apply to mental and emotional struggle. Displays or outbursts of negative emotion tend to reflect poorly on people, particularly men as they are thought to be stronger than women.

It is mostly populated by the Shona people, the majority of whom are Christian. However, the country also has a great diversity of languages, communities, beliefs and customs. The dominant culture of Zimbabwe has significantly changed from its traditional form under the influence of British ', 'colonisation', ', technology and contemporary social pressures. While some Zimbabweans in rural areas continue to practise and maintain traditional customs and beliefs, they represent a relatively small segment of the population. Today, for many Zimbabweans the value of the British education system, Christianity and economic prosperity has taken priority over certain cultural practices. This being said, social etiquette and identity are still deeply informed by the traditional social structures and conventions of tribal groups. Most Zimbabweans maintain deep respect for and connection to their ancestors and heritage, despite urban migration and globalisation.', 'Ethnic Groups and Languages', 'The indigenous people of Zimbabwe trace back to Bantu origins and are believed to have populated the land for more than 10 centuries. The Shona and Ndebele people are the two biggest ethnicities. The Shona form the majority of the population – approximately 80%. They traditionally have a strong regional ', 'clan', ' structure, with six main groups: the Manyika, the Ndau, the Zezuru, the Karanga, the Korekore and the Rozvi. These groups are formed on the basis of linguistic and cultural similarities. The Ndebele comprise roughly 14% of the population and have two main tribal groups: the Ndebele and Kalanga. Smaller ethnic groups include the Venda, the Batonga/Balonka and the Shangani/Shangane people. Some white Zimbabweans (mainly of British origin) remain in the country and there are also some Asian communities in the cities. However, both these groups make up less than 1% of the population. Most white Zimbabweans migrated when the country achieved independence from British rule.', 'Almost all Zimbabweans can speak a native Bantu language, with Shona being the most widely spoken. Zezuru, Kalanga, Manyika and Ndau are the four main dialects of Shona that have a common vocabulary and similar tonal and grammatical features. However, English is used in government, administration, schooling and higher education. Hence, many Zimbabweans also speak English expertly. Urban Zimbabweans can generally alternate between Shona and English fluidly; however, some of the younger generation may be less fluent in their native tongue and need to substitute some Shona words with English words.', 'Social Changes', 'Zimbabwe achieved independence from the United Kingdom in 1980, following decades of British ', 'colonisation', '. The effects of ', 'colonisation', ' remain imprinted on aspects of society. This is especially visible in the widespread use of English, the adoption of Christianity and associated Christian family values. Colonial impact has left a dualism in the practices and values of Zimbabweans. For example, the country operates under a twofold legal system incorporating both traditional law and Roman Dutch Law. Traditional chiefs enforce traditional law whereas Roman Dutch Law is the conventional law. Both legal systems are legitimate and any decision made independently by them is legally binding.', 'Increased urbanisation and globalisation have also influenced the traditional culture of Zimbabwe. Pop culture and the Internet have introduced ideas of personal and individual choice, leading some to value those new ideas over societal obligation and communal organisation. Young people in particular are challenging ideas of the cultural ', 'hierarchy', '. Furthermore, while traditional Zimbabwean culture takes quite a fluid approach to timekeeping, the growing population living in the larger cities is becoming more time-bound. Many native Zimbabweans see these changes posing a negative effect on the traditional family and social structures. Others would argue that access and exposure to technology has enhanced their practices to suit the contemporary environment. Either way, the globalisation of cities has created a power imbalance between urban dwellers and rural dwellers. Most rural households are partly or totally dependent on the remittances sent back by a family member in an urban area.', 'Zimbabwean society has also been significantly changed by immediate social pressures and necessity. President Robert Mugabe and his ruling party held power undemocratically for almost 40 years since independence. Under this leadership, the economy and infrastructure deteriorated, and political freedom and dissent was suppressed. In 2017, Mugabe was pressured to resign in a historic turn of events following a coup that ended his dictatorship. His removal from power has given many Zimbabweans a renewed sense of hope. Nevertheless, the country now faces a transitional period as it continues to struggle with massive inflation that has impoverished many and hinders social mobility. HIV/AIDS has also devastated communities. In 2009, it was estimated that 1.3 million children have been orphaned by AIDS in Zimbabwe.1 Indeed, it is worth noting that the population is very young, meaning that the effects of these problems are felt most acutely by adolescents. Almost 60% of the population is under 25 years of age and almost 37.8% are 14 years old or younger.2', 'Social Hierarchy', 'There is also a strong cultural ', 'hierarchy', ' of respect based on age that affects all interactions in Zimbabwe. Those who are older are presumed to be superior, wiser and more knowledgeable. Hence, heightened respect should be shown to elders. One is expected to always allow their opinion to prevail, never argue with them and never answer back. Expect social situations to be slightly segregated by age whereby children are noticeably excluded from jokes and ‘adult conversations’.', 'Zimbabweans are generally status-conscious as the differences between social classes are also quite noticeable. People tend to be quite proud of their achievements and show off their wealth. Compliments about someone’s wealth are more likely to boost their confidence than make them feel awkward. The way people dress and eat can also be a social indicator between those that are impoverished, those that work in agriculture and live in rural areas, and those that live in the cities. Zimbabweans generally identify themselves by their region of birth when getting acquainted with someone, as this implies their linguistic background and, in some cases, their social attitudes and politics.', 'Zimbabweans take deep pride in the educational standards of their country. According to UNESCO, 91.75% of Zimbabwean youths are literate while the adult literacy rate is 86.87%.3 One’s education level and English proficiency are often seen as the pathway to foreign exposure, travel and employment outside of agriculture. It is also thought to indicate good family background and wealth. Despite varying political opinions, many Zimbabweans remained proud of the fact that their long-term President (Robert Mugabe) was the most educated in Africa.', 'Origins and Ancestry', 'Zimbabweans generally have an innate awareness of their ancestors that follows them throughout their life and keeps them grounded. Traditionally, it was believed that their spirits could be communicated with to provide guidance (see ', 'Traditional Beliefs', ' under ', 'Religion', ' for more information on this). They were deeply revered and worshipped. Today, Christian churches in Zimbabwe generally frown upon ancestor worship and discourage people from calling on the spirits. However, some Zimbabweans living mostly in rural areas (including Christians) have continued the tradition. Though there is a reduced belief in the spiritual realm and the ability of ancestors to intervene with life, one’s heritage remains crucial to Zimbabweans’ concept of personal identity.', 'Zimbabweans learn of their origin through stories told by elders; everyone’s origin is connected to the original province that their people came from centuries ago. Every person also has a totem ', '(mutupo)', ' that represents their heritage, bloodline, origin and identity. Someone who does not know their totem is considered ‘lost’, for it means they do not know their identity. Totems are usually animals (e.g. a zebra or buffalo); however, they can also be objects (e.g. a leg). They are passed down through the father’s lineage the way a surname is carried through a family in the English-speaking West. In this way, two people with the same totem can be forbidden from marrying as it is seen in a similar light to incest.', 'Traditional Customs', 'Zimbabwean tribes and communities are traditionally collectivistic. People tend to put their group or family’s interests before their own, receiving support, protection and a sense of belonging in return. There is a great emphasis on communal gathering within tribes, where people share stories, music, songs and dance. Indeed, Zimbabwean culture has a long tradition of storytelling and folklore that provides each generation with a sense of connection to their history and ancestors. These stories also provide communities with a unified understanding of their group’s origins. Storytelling gatherings may be accompanied with theatrical and musical performances.', 'Music and dance are also central to Zimbabwean culture. The traditional sounds, rhythms and instruments are distinctive and showcase the colour, creativity, spirit and joy of the Zimbabwean people. The ‘', 'mbira’', ' (a piece of wood with metal keys) has a light, warm, acoustic sound and is used in most celebrations. The mbira may be used to contact spirits, govern the weather and chase away sickness (among other purposes) and can be considered sacred in some communities.', 'There are many other rituals and ceremonial practices in Zimbabwe. Some are specific to certain tribes whilst others are more widely practised. Many relate to celebrating milestones in people’s lives, such as marriage, the installation of chiefs or the circumcision ceremony that marks a boy’s transition to manhood. Traditional ceremonies, festivals and rituals also usually involve contacting the spirit world and making offerings (see ', 'Traditional Beliefs', ' under ', 'Religion', ' for more information on this). However, it should be noted that many urbanised Zimbabweans do not believe in the spirit realm, especially among those in Australia.', 'Politeness and Tsika', 'Zimbabweans are often observed as being very warm, welcoming and engaging. They are also quite formal and non-confrontational. People generally seek to appease and avoid any disagreement or friction that could offend someone’s honour. Hence, Zimbabweans may be overly accommodating of other people’s opinions or reluctant to speak their mind if they feel their honesty could embarrass others. This is partly because there is a strong cultural value placed upon considerate behaviour, manners and ', 'politeness', '. One’s manners are generally thought to reflect their integrity and quality as a person.\xa0Every distinct social and ethnic group in Zimbabwe has a particular model for what they consider to be correct and polite decorum. For example, the largest group, the Shona, refer to one’s knowledge and compliance with socially acceptable behaviour as ', '‘tsika’.', 'Tsika is the virtuous, polite and moral way of behaving in accordance with Shona cultural standards. This involves being respectful to elders, obedient to parents and figures of authority, having self-control and patience, as well as observing cultural customs and the social structures in place. Often, there is a strong emphasis on communal values, warmth, prudence and considerate behaviour. The Shona see tsika as something one learns and develops in adolescence to eventually foster self-control. Someone who has been taught and raised well to have good manners is said to have ', '‘hunhu’', ' (in Shona) or ', '‘ubuntu’', ' (in Nbedele). Hunhu and ubuntu cannot be accurately translated into English, but they mean something similar to ‘the essence of humanity/humaneness’.', 'The values that underpin the ', 'norms', ' of etiquette vary between cultures. Hence, native Zimbabweans often think that ', '‘varungu’ ', '(white people) do not have hunhu/ubuntu; this is because people outside of Zimbabwe often do not follow the same social rules that constitute tsika. For example, the English-speaking West doesn’t give the same amount of reverence and respect to people based on their age. Someone who does not act according to the Zimbabwean code of ', 'politeness', ' and social appropriateness is considered to be without manners – ', '‘hanna tsika’.', '_____________________', '1\xa0National Aids Council, 2010\xa02\xa0CIA World Factbook, 20163\xa0UNESCO, 2015']"
afghan,"['Resilience', 'Stoicism', 'Independence', 'Loyalty', 'Tribalism', 'Honour', 'Compassion', 'Hospitality', 'Afghanistan is a landlocked south-central Asian country bordering Iran, Pakistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan. It is a multi-ethnic society, containing diverse ethnic, linguistic and tribal groups. The government is an Islamic Republic and Islamic values, concepts and practices inform many social and behavioural ', 'norms', ' throughout society. Afghans generally have a strong sense of personal honour and are highly aware of their community’s opinion of them. Hospitality, loyalty and modesty are highly valued. However, Afghan culture and daily life have been significantly impacted by constant conflict. Resilience is now an essential trait that has become instilled within the Afghan character as a result of these experiences.', 'National Identity', 'The relentless conflicts of the late 20th and 21st century have produced generations of Afghans who have rarely experienced peace. They have resisted invasions from Great Britain and the Soviet Union, and continue to persevere despite the ongoing insurgency by the ', 'Taliban', ' and others. Consequently, many Afghans think of themselves as survivors. Further, people are often strongly opposed to outside interference in internal politics. This has translated into a prevailing national attitude that strongly favours independence from controlling bodies. However, the assertion of the country’s independence has not necessarily resulted in national cohesiveness. Afghans tend to hold a stronger sense of loyalty for their kin, tribe or ', 'ethnicity', ' than their national identity (see ', 'Ethnicity', ' below).', 'Some older Afghans may see the hardship and political turmoil of the past few decades as a recent devastating chapter in a much longer peaceful history. Prior to the Soviet invasion, Afghanistan was widely considered to be a peaceful country in the Asia region. For example, the country remained neutral during World War II. People may express disappointment or dismay at the fact that most Western perceptions of their country are formulated around news of terrorism and turmoil without insight into the geopolitical factors that caused such conflicts.', 'Such perceptions overlook many of the positive aspects of the culture, such as its respect for artistry and intellectualism. For example, the Afghan artistic style is very decorative and embellished. Many Afghan items are beautifully embroidered in woven finery, including those that are used for everyday purposes (e.g. grain bags). Embellishment is also noticeable in the language, with poetry being one of the most admired art forms. Respect is shown to those who have proof of expertise and can speak eloquently.', 'Community Organisation', 'According to the most recently available estimates, over 60% of the Afghan population is under 25 years of age.', '1', ' This young age structure reflects the impact of decades of conflict, widespread poverty, political instability, displacement and the lack of substantial infrastructure. Most reside in rural areas, as Afghan culture is traditionally agricultural. Many people are produce or livestock farmers living at a subsistence level. Generally, all Afghans have to work very hard to make ends meet (child labour is common from the age of five and involves both genders).', 'Most villages and rural regions tend to govern themselves. In small villages, there is a lack of schools, stores or government representation. There may be three authority figures: the village head man (', 'malik', '), the master of water distribution (', 'mirab', ') and the teacher of Islamic laws (', 'mullah', ') whose role is to make judgements as to whether someone’s behaviour is observing of the Qur’an. Often a village will have a large landowner (', 'khan', ') who governs by assuming the role of both the\xa0malik\xa0and\xa0mirab. However, an assembly of men (', 'jirga', ') usually vote on the important decisions that affect the whole village or tribe.', 'Dependence upon kin and community is particularly crucial to survival as there is a broad absence and mistrust of government involvement in people’s personal lives. This is exacerbated by the underfunded social services that are often unable to meet basic needs due to corruption and lack of security. Therefore, if an Afghan is in crisis and essential needs must be met, they usually have no choice but to turn to those of the same family, village/community, tribe or ', 'ethnicity', ' for assistance (in that general order of preference).', 'Ethnicity', 'One’s ', 'ethnicity', ' is an instant cultural identifier in Afghanistan and usually defines people’s social organisation. The most common ethnic groups are the Pashtuns, Tajiks and Hazaras. However, there are also significant populations of Uzbeks, Nuristani, Aimak, Turkmen and Baloch (among others).', 'Pashtuns', 'The Pashtun are the largest ethnic group in Afghanistan. Most speak Pashto and are Sunni Muslims. Pashtun culture and social organisation have been traditionally influenced by tribal codes of honour and interpretations of Islamic law. This is recognised as ‘', 'Pashtunwali', '’ – a moral and legal code that determines the social expectations one should follow to honour Islamic and cultural values. Pashtunwali, in its strictest form, is mostly only followed in rural tribes. However, its influence can still be seen in much of Pashtun behaviour. For example, values such as honour, loyalty, hospitality and protection of female relatives remain important principles of social responsibility throughout Afghanistan.', 'The Pashtun are widely regarded as the most politically influential and dominant group in Afghanistan.', '2', ' Successive governments have formed via the political expansion of Pashtun tribes with international assistance. Members of minority ethnicities have argued that the national identity of the country is exclusionary of non-Pashtun ethnicities. “', 'Afghanistan', '” actually means “', 'Land of the Pashtun', '” in Dari. Indeed, “', 'Afghan', '” exclusively referred to Pashtuns before it came to refer to the citizens of the state.', 'Nevertheless, while Pashtuns have continuously held advantage in the political domain, many do not see or receive the privileges that come from being a member of the most dominant ethnic group. Political power and economic wealth definitively lies in the hands of the few. Many Pashtuns earn subsistence-level or very modest incomes as traders, farmers, livestock breeders and merchants.', 'Tajiks', 'The Tajiks have Persian heritage and are Afghanistan’s second largest ', 'ethnicity', '. Unlike most other ethnicities, they are not tribal and do not organise themselves by tribal association. Instead, their loyalty revolves around their family and village (or local community for those living in urban areas). This is evident in the way many Tajik last names tend to reflect their place of origin, rather than their tribe or ', 'ethnicity', '.', 'Tajiks are majority Sunni Muslim and generally speak a dialect of Persian found in Eastern Iran. The Tajiks tend to be more urbanised than many other ethnicities and are relatively less rigid in their adherence to provincial attitudes. Some reside in Kabul or the north-eastern part of the country. Many also live in the west, close to the Iranian border. Those who live in the cities are usually traders or skilled artisans. However, the majority are farmers and herders.', 'Tajiks commonly have a high level of education and wealth (in comparison to some of Afghanistan’s more impoverished ethnicities), which has seen them be widely considered to be among Afghanistan’s elite. According to Minority Rights Group International, this accumulated privilege gives them quite a high social status as an ethnic group. However, the Tajik political influence is not very dominant. Many Tajiks have been persecuted amidst the unrest of the past 35 years and discussions over their political representation in government continue.', 'Hazaras', 'The Hazara people are widely understood to be one of the most socially and politically marginalised ethnic groups in Afghanistan. They speak a dialect of Dari known as ‘', 'Hazaragi', '’\xa0and make up the largest Shi’a Muslim population in the country. Most Hazaras live in the central mountain region (called the\xa0', 'Hazarajat', ') and in certain districts of Kabul.', 'The Hazaras have been persecuted by Pashtun leaders, civil warlords, the ', 'Taliban', ', ISIS and others due to their Shi’a Muslim beliefs. For example, government policies have excluded them from public service and capped their ranks in the military. This has resulted in their systemic lack of political power and influence in a Sunni Muslim majority country. The persecution of Hazaras has been particularly fierce as they have hereditary features (from distant Mongol ancestry) that physically distinguish their ', 'ethnicity', ' from other Afghans.', 'Many Hazaras have lived through raids and massacres of their people, both in past and recent years. Some have escaped this danger in neighbouring Pakistan where other Sunni extremists have also sought to target and kill them. Consequently, many have been left with no choice but to flee to more distant countries. As a result, a large portion of the Afghans in Western countries are Hazara refugees who have sought asylum from this situation.', 'The Hazarajat region remains very poor, meaning many Hazaras are economically supported by a male family member who has journeyed to a city or neighbouring country to find work. Being at the bottom of the economic and social ', 'hierarchy', ' has also stigmatised Hazaras in the minds of most other ethnic groups. This is acutely reflected in the lack of inter-ethnic marriages with Hazaras. Nevertheless, more recently, Hazaras have been pursuing higher education and political positions to represent their people and become leaders in the newly emerging ', 'democracy', '.', 'Tribes', 'Within many ethnic groups, there are long-standing tribal clans formed through kinships. These tribes often live as local communities in villages. Most tribes inherit the land and means of production from their ancestors. Others may continue the nomadic lifestyle their forebears lived. In small villages and rural areas, there is usually little social mobility between occupations as people are expected to take over their parents’ form of economic contribution, which may also be circumscribed by tribal positioning.', 'Some Afghans’ affiliations to their tribes have been disrupted as conflict has forced people to prioritise their individual family’s survival. However, those who have remained connected and united with their tribe continue to be extremely loyal. For those people, loyalty to their tribe is secondary only to their obligation to their family. Tribes generally uphold:', 'the right and duty to avenge any wrong against its people;', 'the right of fugitives to seek refuge and sanctuary;', 'the duty to show hospitality to guests and protect them if need be;', 'the need to defend their property and honour; and', 'the need to defend and protect one’s female relatives.', 'Over the centuries, rival tribal groups have constantly competed over rights to land, resources, power and even women. This has engendered a competitive spirit in Afghan culture and has been the cause of a great deal of recurrent violence and disharmony between tribes and ethnicities.', 'Honour', 'Much social behaviour is influenced by Afghans’ awareness of their personal honour. ‘Honour’ in this sense encompasses an individual’s reputation, prestige and worth. Preservation of honour and community opinion is often at the forefront of people’s minds. It influences people to behave conservatively in accordance with social expectations to avoid drawing attention to themselves or risk doing something perceived to be dishonourable.', 'As members of a collectivist society, most Afghans consider a person’s behaviour to be reflective of the family, tribe or ', 'ethnicity', ' they belong to. Thus, when a person’s behaviour is perceived to be dishonourable, their family shares the shame. When the dishonourable behaviour occurs outside of a person’s community, other Afghans can often quickly implicate that person’s ethnic group, tribe and/or religion as the cause of their behaviour. As a result, Afghans can be wary of the fact that they need to give a public impression of dignity and integrity to protect the honour of those they are associated with. To prevent indignity, criticism is rarely given directly and praise is expected to be generously offered.', 'The senior male of a family is considered to be responsible for protecting the honour of the family. They are often particularly concerned with the behaviour of the women in their family, as females have many social expectations to comply with. These relate to their moral code, dress, social interactions, education, economic activity and public involvement (visit ', 'Family', ' for more information). A breach of social compliance by a woman can be perceived as a failure on the man’s behalf (her father, husband or brother) to protect her from doing so.', 'Ethnic Relations and Politics', 'Relationships between different ethnic groups can be tense. Minority ethnic groups have often argued that the national identity, politics and civil service of Afghanistan exclude non-Pashtuns. Pashtun public interests commonly supersede those of other ethnicities that seek greater recognition. This has been exacerbated by the fact that insurgency groups, such as the ', 'Taliban', ', are predominantly made up of Pashtun men. The ', 'Taliban', ' is not only a religious extremist group, but also a Pashtun nationalist group aiming to establish an Afghan emirate.', '3', 'In addition to the mistreatment some ethnicities have suffered under others in the recent decades of war, there are many ethnic feuds that have been passed down through generations. For example, Pashtuns may fault the Uzbeks for the actions of the previous generations, and the violent conflict between Pashtuns and Hazaras can be traced back to the 19th century. Sometimes the Afghan sense of honour means that different groups feel old injustices need to be avenged. The loyalty to blood ties and ', 'ethnicity', ' reflects the deep tribalism and ', 'collectivism', ' of Afghan society.', 'Current Experiences', 'More recently, the ethno-linguistic groups of Afghanistan have experienced a degree of unity through the shared experience of unremitting war, displacement and survival. This has given rise to cultural resilience but also national exhaustion. As the source of the world’s largest and most enduring refugee population, many Afghans have a shared experience of exile. Millions have been involuntarily displaced to surrounding countries such as Pakistan and Iran where they reside as refugees in dangerous, marginalising and uncertain conditions. Some have fled to the West to escape capture, torture or death. The majority of Afghan-born people residing in Western countries share this war-torn experience. Today, most people wish for peaceful relations.', 'The Afghan people have also been slowly reclaiming their freedom of expression since the early 2000s. Communications have improved and developed quickly in the last 10 years or so. Today, many people have up-to-date technology and smartphones that allow them to access the internet and media outlets. Social media is also widely used, which has led to a flourishing involvement of youth who are highly politically engaged. The modern aspirations of the younger generation have changed with the arrival of the internet and mass media.', '', '_____________________', '1\xa0Central Intelligence Agency, 2018', '2\xa0Minority Rights Group International, 2018', '3 Seerat, 2017']"

The region’s struggles with colonialism and the 1971 Bangladesh Liberation War have shaped modern Bangladesh. Today, many foreigners continue to view Bangladesh through a lens of ‘development’. However, many Bangladeshis resist depictions of their culture that define it by recent hardships. Rather, longstanding cultural traditions and artistic expressions provide a great source of pride for many Bangladeshis.', 'Ethnicity and Identity', 'The vast majority of Bangladeshis (98.0%) are identified as Bengali. The term ‘Bengali’ is used to describe both an ', 'ethnicity', ' and a language. Those who identify as Bengali typically speak Bangla, known as ‘Bengali’ among most non-natives. The government of Bangladesh also recognises 27 other ethnic minorities. This figure is contested, with some arguing that there are over 70 ethnic groups within the country. Many of those who are not Bengali reside in the Chittagong Hill Tracts, the region where most of Bangladesh’s indigenous populations reside.', 'Citizens of Bangladesh are often engaged in an ongoing discussion over which term – ‘Bangladeshi’ or ‘Bengali’ – is a more accurate descriptor both on an individual and national level. Those who feel strongly attached to Bengal or belong to an ethnic minority may have widely differing viewpoints. Some people believe that Bangladeshi and Bengali are synonymous. For others (such as Islamic activists and ', 'secular', ' thinkers), religion is an important factor within these discussions. Bangladesh’s national identity has become increasingly linked to Islam, and many hold the belief that Islam is what distinguishes Bangladesh from Bengal. See the ', 'Religion', ' section for more information on this point.\xa0', 'A key historical moment in terms of identity is the Bangladesh Liberation War of 1971. Originally, Bangladesh was part of Pakistan, and was often referred to as ‘East Pakistan’. Eventually, Bangladesh sought independence from Pakistan, largely on the basis of a cultural heritage and religious affiliation that was distinct from both Pakistan and the greater Bengal region respectively. Bangladeshi military units called ', 'Mukhti Bahini', ' (‘freedom fighters’) fought Pakistani troops throughout the country. It is unknown exactly how many people were killed during the Bangladesh Liberation War, with estimates ranging from 300,000 to 3 million. Additionally, close to 10 million people fled Bangladesh for West Bengal, located in India. Nearly all Bangladeshi families were affected, as almost every family had members who fought in the liberation struggle. This struggle saw the forging of an identity that correlated Bengali with ‘Muslim’, rather than seeing Bangladesh be subsumed into Pakistan or West Bengal. Many Bangladeshis see the liberation struggle as a source of pride and a symbol of Bangladeshis’ tendency to persevere in the face of difficulties.', 'Rural Life and the ‘Gram’ (Village)', 'The majority of Bangladeshis (roughly 65%) live in rural areas. This, coupled with Bangladesh’s very high population density, means securing land tenure and property rights has become critical. Many feel connected to the rural character of Bangladesh, regardless of whether they live at home or abroad. It is common for people to have family residing in their home village (', 'gram', '). Many of those who move to larger cities for employment will visit their home village during vacations to maintain their relationships and ties. Additionally, much of Bangladeshi literature and artistic expression pays homage to the rural aspect of the culture. For more information about the importance of rural and village life, see the ', 'Family', ' section.', 'Interdependence and Interactions', 'Bangladesh is a collectivistic society, which means that many Bangladeshis are community or family oriented. Individuals often understand themselves as members of their village, family or religion rather than an individual and autonomous actor.

Many Bangladeshis consider this conduct to be a sign of maturity. One’s behaviour varies based on the other person’s position within the social ', 'hierarchy', '.

However, Cambodian culture has been recovering and rebuilding in the wake of mass killings carried out by the Khmer Rouge regime during the 1970s. Contemporary Cambodia is experiencing a revival of traditional cultural values and practices while still coping with the legacy of the Khmer Rouge regime.', 'Homogeneity and the Khmer Ethnicity', 'Cambodia is a fairly homogeneous society, with 97.6% of Cambodians identifying as ethnically Khmer. Many Cambodians today consider themselves to be descendants of the Khmer people from the Khmer Empire. Indeed, the terms ‘Cambodian’ and ‘Khmer’ are often used interchangeably, with the term ‘Khmer’ commonly used to refer to the Cambodian language, people and culture. This suggests that Khmer is more widely perceived as an ethnic and linguistic identity marker than a political entity.', 'The religious landscape of Cambodia is similarly homogeneous with 96.9% of the population identifying as Buddhist.

The main goal of the regime, led by Pol Pot, was to create a socialist society where modern influences of the urban population (“New People”) were to be eradicated in order to return Cambodia to a pre-modern society of “Old People”. Consequently, millions of Cambodians were killed (an estimated 1.5 to 3 million) due to execution, forced hardships, disease and starvation. Buddhist monks, urban dwellers, government officials and people with a Western education were perceived by the regime as supporters of the “New People” culture and, as such, were among the initial targets of the regime.', 'Most Cambodians were forced to evacuate urban areas into labour camps in rural Cambodia in order to work in farming. This broke down previous distinctions based on class and the urban-rural divide among the population. Some attempted to escape by crossing the Cambodian-Thai border, with many Cambodians remaining in refugee camps for years until they were able to resettle in receiving countries around the world.', 'Many artefacts of Cambodian heritage and history – such as historical books, files, works of art, literature and religious temples – were also destroyed during this period. Much of the post-regime period has been dedicated to rebuilding Cambodian culture in light of the tragedies. Nearly all Cambodian families were affected by the Khmer Rouge regime, experiencing immense loss or separation, suffering and trauma. While over half of the population has been born since the regime ended (50.26% of the population are between the ages of 0 and 24), the after-effects of the regime are still felt today.', ""Demeanour and 'Face'"", 'The Cambodian proverb “Fear not the future, weep not for the past” captures the general approach to life followed by many Cambodians. Given the tragedies experienced during the Khmer Rouge regime, many have demonstrated immense forgiveness in order to live harmoniously with those who were a part of the regime as well as those Khmer who may have lost loved ones. Cambodians also tend to have a stoic and cheerful demeanour. They rarely complain or show discomfort. People often smile or laugh in various scenarios, regardless of whether the situation is positive or negative. Thus, for a Cambodian, a smile does not necessarily equate to expressing happiness, agreement or amusement.', 'The concept of ', 'face', ' is also one of the underpinning factors influencing the way in which Cambodians behave and interact with one another. Many Cambodians also seem to have a calm disposition, while also avoiding excessive displays of negative emotions (e.g. anger, selfishness) or outbursts. This is partially as a way to maintain ', 'face', '.', 'Social Interactions', 'Many social interactions among Cambodians take into account another individual’s status relative to oneself (i.e. their age, level of education, line of work). In nearly all cases, how one sits, walks or otherwise interacts with others will depend upon the status of each person present. Therefore, it is not uncommon for Cambodians to ask personal questions to discern your status to ensure they address you correctly and behave appropriately.', 'Cambodians also tend to have a sense of attachment and pride for their family, village and district. Being a collectivistic society, strong emphasis is placed on honouring and being loyal towards one’s family. Indeed, loyalty to one’s family, friends or community will, at times, override social rules. For example, Cambodians rarely jeopardise the interests of the collective group and often take responsibility for fellow members. Moreover, one’s community or extended family is typically understood as more important than the individual. The individual generally has limited privacy and is expected to act for the good of their community in order to maintain ', 'harmony', '.']"

Its cultural influence is felt throughout the Asian region and has impacted the world on a large scale through the arts, sciences, cuisine, production and trade. Chinese culture has undergone a rapid and intense transformation over the past 50 years and continues to adapt to the modern world. Due to the country's massive size and long, complex history, it is difficult to summarise the society without running the risk of oversimplifying the culture. The immense geographic and demographic size of the nation accommodates many different ethnic groups that each have distinctive dialects, customs and traditions. It is important to recognise this diversity, as the West has a tendency to perceive the Chinese as a homogeneous people."", 'China’s Seclusion', 'For two millennia, the Chinese empire was one of the most advanced and innovative civilisations in the world. The dynasties had incredible cultural and military success, conquering and absorbing neighbouring societies into their own. An ethnocentric understanding of the world came to resonate with the Chinese, as their experience with foreigners was generally limited to confrontations with those who tried to invade them or those that they overpowered and assimilated into their empire. Given this, when European traders arrived in the 1500s, the population initially struggled to comprehend how they fit into a wider, modern nation-state system. The Chinese had considered themselves the epicentre of the world for centuries, so the dynasty initially showed no real interest in getting involved in global politics.', ""The empire eventually collapsed and became reimagined as a nation-state. However, the Chinese sense of cultural superiority led the country to isolate itself further. As the Western and Eastern worlds advanced trade and began to globalise, China continued to be a secluded and conservative country into the 20th century. Diversions from traditional conventions were strongly resisted. From the late 1940s onward, the sovereign government rejected globalisation, enforced national unification through a stringent communist regime. This regime was known to deny the traditional values of Chinese culture and embrace a new set of values and beliefs. Life was largely contained to the country’s borders with a closed economy (until 1978) and closed borders (until 1974). In 1978, the nation acknowledged the need for international involvement and began to embrace modernisation and globalisation. The Chinese Economic Reform heralded a new era of Chinese openness. Attention shifted to focus on prosperity, science and culture, with the Communist Party's control on individuals' liberties loosening."", 'Society Today', ""In light of China’s history and recent fundamental change, one must appreciate that the people have been receptive or “open” to the outside world for only the past 40 years. Since this radical transformation, cities have commercialised and corporatised. The Chinese people now enjoy the freedom to travel, get an overseas education and learn other languages. Though behaviour remains tightly regulated and the culture still echoes the country's feudal past, China has become more internationally exposed. Contemporary Chinese culture is heavily influenced by a unique combination of its embedded traditions and this recent, rapid modernisation."", 'Today, a clear divide in social attitudes is visible in the different mindsets between the young and old, as well as urban and rural dwellers. The older generation and rural Chinese tend to value traditional culture and try to preserve and uphold it. On the other hand, Chinese youths and city dwellers tend to be more accepting and enthusiastic about progressive ideals. There are also different opinions throughout the population regarding the importance of cultural preservation and modernisation.', 'Nevertheless, the country maintains a fundamental understanding of what it means to be Chinese. The Chinese cultural identity has been developed through centuries of shared history and customs (such as Confucianism, ‘filial ', 'piety', '’, ', '‘guanxi’\xa0', ""and the government's involvement in individuals' lives). As such, the current mindset of the Chinese people is a combination of their modern aspirations and traditional origins. The emerging Chinese culture is being defined by its innovation, preservation and recent cultural and economic evolutions."", 'Ethnic and Language Composition', 'The Chinese government officially recognises 56 ethnic groups within the country, with the vast majority identified as ethnically Han Chinese (91.6%). This ethnic group outnumbers the minority ethnic groups in every province and autonomous region, except for Tibet and Xinjiang. For this reason, the dominant culture, traditions and written language in China are that of the Han. Where minority ethnic groups are found in large numbers, the areas are often classified as autonomous regions (e.g. Tibet). In some areas of China (such as the southwest), many ethnic groups reside within the same geographic region. They may live in isolation from one another, as each has generally maintained their own distinct cultural traits and language. Some also have different economic structures.', ""As China’s ethnic landscape is largely homogeneous, the population’s diversity is generally understood on a linguistic basis. There are several language families represented in the country. The Sino-Tibetan family is by far the most salient. Within this language family, Han Chinese is the most widely spoken. However, the Han speak several mutually unintelligible dialects largely distinguished by regional differences. By far the most known is\xa0‘Mandarin,'\xa0also known as\xa0"", ""‘putonghua,'"", ""\xa0which means ‘ordinary language.' There are three variations of Mandarin depending on the region.

While there are nearly 50,000 characters, only about 8,000 are in regular use. While people in different regions may struggle to understand each other’s spoken language, most use the same basic set of characters and can communicate in writing.', 'Confucianism', 'Confucianism is a guiding philosophy in China that emphasises the importance of healthy human interactions. It promotes the idea that relationships between people are unequal and that everyone should have defined hierarchical roles (for example, ruler and subject, husband and wife, father and son). It teaches that when this natural inequality is accepted and respected, it becomes easier to maintain harmonious, stable relations between individuals and, therefore, in society as a whole. The Confucian logic of obedience, responsibility and adherence affects many aspects of Chinese behaviour and attitudes about virtue. The Chinese sense of duty and societal cohesiveness is encapsulated in the principle of ', '‘Li’ ', '(social cohesiveness).', 'One may notice that within Chinese society, interactions are tiered and require a level of deference and respect from one party.

However, age is often an overriding factor that determines the level of respect people should show. The importance of age is emphasised in Confucianism as ‘filial "", 'piety', "".' This is the core concept that requires one to give parents and elders utmost respect and devotion. Filial "", 'piety', "" is akin to the reverence of one's ancestors and may entail unconditional obedience of seniors."", 'It is important to note that traditions and Confucian values are losing popularity in China. They still influence the way society functions; thousands of years of traditional education has deeply embedded Confucian concepts such as modesty, obedience, loyalty and filial ', 'piety', ' into society. However, the more traditional tenets of Confucius’s teachings (such as sexist ideologies and rural land tenure) are increasingly viewed as relics of China’s feudal past. In fact, various aspects of Chinese culture have significantly evolved in the past few decades.', 'Unity and Interpersonal Interactions', ""China has one of the most collectivist cultures in the world. However, economic growth and increased financial independence is giving rise to more individualistic attitudes. People are encouraged to share the same mentality or goals as their family, workplace and government. In return for demonstrating loyalty and commitment to duty, an individual gains a sense of protection and unity. As such, the social organisation of China is characterised by people's "", 'interdependence', '. Individuals are taught to keep to themselves and respect the law and authority to maintain societal ', 'harmony', '. The Chinese consider national unity and cooperation to be essential for society to function harmoniously. This is reflected in the most fundamental foundations of the culture. For example, all regions in China follow the same time zone despite the physical landmass spanning five geographical time zones. This provides for a national sense of belonging and equality.', 'The cultural emphasis on unity and ', 'harmony', "" also means that the Chinese have a strong relational focus. Interpersonal interactions are approached sensitively, with an acute consideration of people's feelings. All behaviour and communication in China are influenced by the concept of 'face'. Face is the quality, embedded in most Asian cultures, representing a person's reputation, influence, dignity and honour. Individuals usually act deliberately and with "", 'restraint', "" to protect their self-worth and peer perception. Conservative conduct is the norm, as people don't want to stand out and/or risk losing face by doing something that is considered inappropriate. Face is so intrinsic to Chinese culture that the government and business entities incorporate it into their decision-making processes. For example, a company may buy expensive equipment that is never used to improve their face'."", 'Guanxi', 'Another important concept in interpersonal interactions is that of ', '‘guanxi’', '. The word ‘', 'guanxi', '’ is a general term used to describe relationships that may also result in the exchange of connections or favours that benefit both people.

Good "", 'guanxi', ' can sometimes be necessary to creating opportunities that otherwise would not be accessible. Mutual trust is essential to ', 'guanxi', '. In turn, many Chinese will prioritise relationship building, particularly in a business context.', 'Politeness and Courtesy', 'Perceptions of ', 'politeness', ' and courtesy (‘', 'limao', '’) in China differ from those in Australia. Traditional Chinese courtesy rests on the lifelong hierarchical relationships reflected in Confucian ideology. These relationships are already clear, meaning that the Chinese do not feel the need for constant verbal reinforcement through courtesy words like ‘please,’ ‘thank you’ and ‘excuse me’. Many Chinese feel that saying such terms in the company of elders, relatives or close friends creates formality and distance that should not exist. Moreover, some can feel that the repeated use of courtesy words in a habitual way can come across as lacking sincerity.', 'This tradition continues today whereby the Chinese way to show ', 'politeness', ' and kindness is to shorten the social distance between one another. Thus, courtesy words act as a buffer or space that indicates formality and distance. From a Western perspective, the contrast between the ', 'politeness', ' of what one does and the bluntness of what one says can seem confusing. For example, when at a restaurant among friends, a Chinese person will usually pour tea for everyone present at the table before pouring their own. Yet, they may not say ‘excuse me’ when asking for someone to pass them food. In this way, a cultural difference in manners can sometimes be perceived as rude. However, be aware that respect and courtesy are simply exhibited in different ways.', 'Population Density and Public Spaces', 'With a huge population, China has a high population density (especially in its cities) and the space of the average piece of housing is smaller than what is the norm for families in Australia. Therefore, many Chinese favour using public spaces, such as parks, to undertake their personal activities. As crowding is normal and expected, people are generally less protective of the personal space and privacy of themselves and others. The Chinese generally have quite loud public demeanours. People may openly express their emotions, carry out their conversations within earshot of others, sing or even dance with indifference for those around them. Not only is this considered normal behaviour, it generally does not inconvenience the broad Chinese public.', 'This cultural difference in public manners sometimes leads foreigners to interpret Chinese as being rude or disrespectful. In the English-speaking West, public spaces are generally places where their solitude, privacy and personal space is respected. For example, it is common courtesy to lower the volume of one’s voice to avoid disturb those in your vicinity when on public transport, in a park, a library or a cafe. Nevertheless, this is not always the expectation in China. Public spaces are anticipated to be ‘', 'renao', '’ (bustling with noise and excitement) as various people carry out their own activities. People may practice Tai Chi, calligraphy, or even do ballroom dance classes. It is common for other members of the public to join in the activity or stop to watch.', '_____________________', '1 Bains, 2015']"

Hong Kong was under British control as a central port of trade before being reclaimed by China in 1997 as a ‘', 'Special Administrative Region', '’. Today, it is one of the biggest financial hubs in the world. Lifestyles in Hong Kong are urban-centric and cosmopolitan, with the majority of the population being highly educated. The international mindset that comes with its global economic positioning, as well as the influence of British governance, has integrated values of the English-speaking West into the Asian society. While 92% of the population is ethnically Chinese, the culture differs distinctly from that of mainland China.1', 'Social Distinctions', 'Overall, the ethnic Chinese population of Hong Kong can be largely divided into three groups: Hong Kong locals, migrants from mainland China, and anglicised (or westernised) Hong Kongers. Language proficiency is arguably the most obvious and reliable indicator of group identity. Local Hong Kongers tend to speak mostly Cantonese, passable English and very limited Mandarin. Some may refuse to speak Mandarin even if they can. Migrants from mainland China generally speak Mandarin and may not speak Cantonese or English at all (the exceptions being highly skilled migrants). Anglicised Hong Kongers often speak fluent and unaccented English and vary greatly in terms of Mandarin proficiency. In addition to these three groups, there is also a significant non-Chinese population (roughly 8% or 580,000 people).2 Most of them are foreign domestic helpers working in Hong Kong, with the biggest nationalities being Filipinos and Indonesians.', 'Anglicised Hong Kongers are the group that Westerners are most likely to encounter as business partners or migrants to English-speaking countries. They are people who typically attended English Medium schools or international schools, lived or studied abroad, and/or have dual (or more) nationality. Many of their families migrated to western countries before the end of British rule, but returned afterwards in search of better economic opportunities. They often work in financial, legal, or international business/trade sectors. Culturally, they can be described as highly westernised, except with a much stronger emphasis on traditional family values, education and financial success. When interacting with them, one may simply follow British etiquette or that of the English-speaking West in general. The same can be said for local Hong Kongers, who are usually familiar with western etiquette.', 'Local Hong Kongers often strongly disassociate their identity from mainland China, seeing themselves as being very different despite having similar ancestry and governance. In contrast, migrants from mainland China can be quite proud of the mainland Chinese culture and may not feel obliged to adapt to local or western etiquette, even if they live and work in Hong Kong or other countries. It is advisable to respect and observe ', 'this Chinese etiquette', ' when interacting with those who have strong ties with China (e.g. employees of Chinese firms and Chinese officials in Hong Kong).', 'Daily Life', 'Hong Kong is home to one of the world market’s most important and competitive global economies. The success of it has given daily life a fast-paced, entrepreneurial and expeditious quality to it. There is an extreme emphasis on schooling. Children often feel intense pressure from their parents, teachers and peer group to excel. Those from wealthy families or private schools face even higher expectations. Perhaps as a result of this early exposure to demanding standards, being busy throughout one’s life is strongly valued. To be in stressful circumstances in Hong Kong is seen as evidence that one is industrious and tenacious. Some Hong Kongers may even exaggerate their workload size and difficulty to make themselves seem more productive and dedicated.', 'Class status is determined by one’s wealth and social influence in Hong Kong. Power is often gained through familial or government connections. A lower working class is loosely formed by those who have recently immigrated and found employment as domestic house-workers. The level of education and English proficiency one attains also heavily influences one’s social standing.', 'Hong Kong also has a high population density that means housing is largely based in the metropolis. Space is extremely limited and cities are traversed with the aid of elevators, sky-bridges, corridors and underground passageways. It is possible to navigate through large parts of cities without touching real ground. In these ‘concrete jungles’, there are few parks and one often has to venture out into the mountains for outdoor recreation. As such, though physical activity is valued, the culture places a more immediate value on intellectual efforts, such as pursuing academic and business excellence.', 'Traditional Values', ""Complementing the modern-day and Western characteristics of Hong Kong are the traditional Asian attributes that still prevail in society, such as the cultural concept of ‘face’. This is the quality embedded in most Asian cultures that indicates a person's reputation, influence, dignity and honour. By complimenting a person, showing them respect or doing something to increase their self-esteem, you give them face. Similarly, people can lose face and save or build face. Therefore, individuals in Hong Kong usually act deliberately and with "", 'restraint', ' to protect their self-worth and peer perception. Conservative conduct is the norm, as people don’t want to stand out and/or risk losing face by doing something inappropriate.', 'Confucianism has also had a significant influence in Hong Kong. This way of thinking puts emphasis on the importance of healthy human interactions by promoting the idea that relationships between people should be unequal but with clearly defined hierarchical roles (for example, ruler and subject, husband and wife, father and son).

However, Hong Kongers are arguably more influenced by Western ideas such as freedom of speech, rule of law and ', 'democracy', ' due to their period of colonial rule. Though Confucianism forms the basis for many of Hong Kong’s cultural roots, few people (especially among the young generation) uphold all its values. Today, local Hong Kongere largely reject the concepts of natural inequality and hierarchical roles.', 'Age is one of the few remaining traditional factors that forms a visible social strata. Age determines the gradations of respect in Hong Kong, with its importance emphasised through ‘filial ', 'piety', '’. This is a core Confucian concept that requires one to show parents and elders utter respect and devotion. It can sometimes involve unconditional obedience to seniors by, for example, defaulting arguments so they win. Filial ', 'piety', ' traditionally entails reverence of one’s ancestor and many people in Hong Kong regularly hold ceremonies or rituals to worship their ancestors by lighting incense.', 'Hong Kong is more collectivistic than Western societies. Individuals often perceive themselves to be members of groups rather than autonomous actors. These groups reflect or come to define who its members are and often expect a high level of loyalty. For example, the group’s interests usually supersede those of the individual, even if they conflict. Furthermore, group members expect to receive preferential treatment over anyone who is not part of the group.

However, there are common themes and principles that contribute to the values, attitudes, beliefs and ', 'norms', "" of the dominant society. Generally speaking, Indians tend to have a strong sense of pride in the distinctiveness and diversity of their culture. For example, the country’s agricultural expansions and technological advancements in infrastructure, science and engineering are sources of pride. Moreover, a considerable amount of pride stems from India's rich artistic cultural exports of music, fine arts, literature and spirituality (especially the practice of "", 'yoga', ').', 'Geography and Space', 'India’s geography and climate is incredibly diverse.

Both provide irrigation for farmlands, a method of transportation and are considered sacred to many followers of Hinduism.', 'As India has one of the largest populations in the world, public and private spaces are often densely populated. This influences how the idea of privacy is understood, as it is rarely available, sought after or indulged in. Generally, there is a very large cultural tolerance for crowding. For example, several generations often live under one roof, and it is not uncommon to find animals such as cows or dogs freely roaming public streets and villages.', ""The buzzing cities of Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai and Delhi contain a melting pot of rapid economic development and technological innovation, with a notable example being the continually expanding telecommunications sector. Such cities demonstrate India's rise as an economic and political powerhouse on the world stage. This is also represented by the "", 'diaspora', ' of Indian people throughout the globe. The large metropolitan cities stand in contrast to the hundreds of thousands of villages and small towns, each containing distinctive microsocieties. Indians can often determine where someone is from based on their accent, language, style of dress and mannerisms. Indeed, it is common to find people having a sense of regional pride and identity towards their place of origin.', 'Ethnic and Linguistic Composition', 'Although India does not officially recognise racial or ethnic categories in the national census, it continues to be one of the most ethnically diverse populations in the world. Broadly, the ethnicities of India can be broken down into main groups on the basis of their linguistic backgrounds, the two largest being Indo-Aryan and Dravidian. For example, many people belonging to Indo-Aryan ethnicities live in the northern half of the country. Indo-Aryan languages commonly spoken include Hindi, Gujarati, Bengali, Marathi, Urdu, Odia and Punjabi. Meanwhile, people belonging to Dravidian ethnicities generally live in the southern half of the country. Dravidian languages commonly spoken include Tamil, Kannada, Telugu and Malayalam. These labels of ‘Indo-Aryan’ and ‘Dravidian’ usually serve as a helpful way to categorise the origins of Indian ethnic diversity, although they don’t necessarily reflect people’s personal identity. For example, people are unlikely to describe themselves as ‘Indo-Aryan’ or ‘Dravidian’.', 'Within these broad language groups, there is vast linguistic diversity accounting for 22 major languages and hundreds of regional or local languages. Most Indians tend to be bilingual or multilingual, speaking an official language along with their regional language(s). English is considered to be a subsidiary official language that is often reserved for governmental and commercial purposes. People who do not share a common first or native language will generally communicate in either Hindi or English. It is important to be considerate of the linguistic diversity of India as many Indians consider their language (particularly their regional or local language) to be a source of identity.', 'National Identity', 'The ‘Indian identity’ has evolved continuously over the country’s history as political and religious institutions have changed within and outside of India. For example, the British Raj (1858-1947) brought about vast changes in the country’s economic, political and cultural spheres. India’s independence from the British in 1947 was accompanied by the partition of India and Pakistan into the Republic of India and the Islamic Republic of Pakistan respectively. This led to mass violence that continues to be a source of trauma and sadness for many Muslims, Sikhs and Hindus that reside in the Punjab region in northwestern India.', 'Partition reflects the complexities in Indian identity with respect to religion. One temptation is to correlate Hindu identity and values with the Indian national identity. This correlation has been made since British ', 'colonisation', '. However, such a view tends to misrepresent the religious and cultural diversity of India. While it may seem like a useful device for describing a unified national identity, such generalisations perpetuate significant tensions among various groups in Indian society.', ""Earnest efforts have been made throughout the 20th and 21st century to instil a sense of nationhood and move beyond deep tensions and inequalities. Although tensions occasionally surface and at times have resulted in violence, social legislation has sought to empower traditionally disadvantaged segments of society such as ‘Untouchable' castes (see "", 'Social Structure and Stratification', ' below), tribal populations, women and people with disabilities through affirmative action programs.', 'Social Structure and Stratification', 'India has a highly stratified traditional social structure, often referred to as the ‘caste’ system. The term ‘caste’ comes from the word ‘', 'casta’, ', 'which was used by Portuguese observers to describe the social stratification of India’s Hindu society during the colonial period. The caste system in India has a long history sustained by complex cultural and religious factors. Although often classified under one term, the ‘caste’ system represents various overlapping systems of stratification.', 'The large-scale caste system is known as the ‘', 'varna’ ', 'system. This classifies society into four broad categories; ', 'brahmin', ' (priestly caste), ', 'kshatriya', ' (nobility caste), ', 'vaishya ', '(merchant caste) and ', 'shudra', ' (artisan or labourer caste). The categories of varna were a normative religious (specifically Hindu) ideal of how society ought to be structured, but in reality was complicated by various factors.', 'Stigma relating to ideas of ‘purity’ was attached to those within particular castes, and interactions between castes were limited, particularly with those on the bottom tier. The idea of the ‘', 'Dalits', '’ (‘Untouchables’) was a modern addition, popularised by B.R. Ambedkar who was himself an untouchable. This category, thought to be outside of the caste system, was understood as the lowest rank in Indian society.', 'The small-scale caste system, known as the', "" ‘jati'"", ' system, comprises over 2,000 jati categories that determine one’s occupation or vocation based on their family of birth. Each jati is associated with one or more hereditary occupations or vocations (although some occupations are considered to be caste-neutral, such as agriculture or non-traditional civil service). The', ' ', 'jati system is particularly noticeable in the daily social organisation of Indian culture. For example, it is common to find people following the professions of their parents, grandparents and so on.', 'Intercaste Interactions', 'The caste system is no longer legally enforced, and discrimination based on caste is outlawed. In the latter half of the 20th century, Indian governments assigned jati categories into one of four general classes based on economic, social and historical criteria. To address inequalities among jatis, the government has established affirmative action programs, which reserve jobs, education scholarships and other benefits for historically disadvantaged or persecuted castes.', 'Many people do not explicitly adhere to the caste system, particularly in urban areas and large cities. However, social assumptions of the caste remain influential on certain aspects of Indian life. For example, the caste system continues to inform marriage through the practice of arranged marriages, which are usually carried out through existing (often caste-based) networks (see ', 'Relationships and Marriage', ' in ', 'Family', '). The caste system is more strictly adhered to in rural areas.', ""Although upward mobility within the caste system remains difficult, efforts have been made by various jatis to alter the social order and challenge the system itself. The social order is continuously under negotiation, and people from ‘lower' jatis have been known to challenge the social structure by adopting certain elements of the lifestyles of those in more ‘pure' castes. Some examples include abstaining from ‘polluting' or ‘demeaning' occupations, following vegetarianism and avoiding alcohol. Meanwhile, some jatis have been known to emphasise that caste position should be determined by other factors such as economic status, land ownership and political power."", 'Prejudices based on caste tend to persist, both openly and discretely. Many people maintain a subtle awareness of their social position and those around them. Questioning or deviating from one’s expected role is still relatively rare. When interacting with someone from India, it is worth bearing in mind that the caste system still has influence over one’s occupation, social standing and relationships with others. While it is usually inappropriate to inquire into a person’s caste (in the sense of the large-scale varna system), it is socially acceptable to ask about one’s occupation or vocation.', 'Collectivism and Harmony', 'Indians generally place a high value on ', 'harmony', ' and unity with others, keeping a strong nexus with their community and relatives. A unified and interdependent community or family provides a support system that an individual can rely on daily. Community groups are often informed by one’s jati. Many community groups, especially in rural areas in the north, have their own regulating system of self-imposed rules to help maintain order and ', 'harmony', '. Such systems are often seen as necessary due to economic hardship or the unreliability of official services. The regulation of rules does not necessarily come from the upper caste; in some cases, lower caste members may lead the community depending on the area.', 'Indians can almost always trust in their social ties for assistance in virtually any activity. Isolation or seclusion can seem daunting, as group loyalty and assurance of inseparability provides security and confidence. Indians tend to be conscious of how their behaviour may reflect on their family or community. Many tend to emphasise humility and the preservation of their own and collective reputation, dignity and honour. For example, Indians may speak indirectly to avoid conflict and maintain social ', 'harmony', '. People are also expected to uphold their duties, responsibilities and obligations. Indeed, it is common to find Indians abroad sending remittances back to their family in India to provide financial support.', 'Karma, Acceptance and Personal Choice', 'Many Indians tend to have a sense of acceptance towards one’s life position or a belief that, due to actions in one’s past life, good or bad personal circumstances are deserved. This attitude partly stems from religious ideas such as ‘', 'karma', '’ (the idea that one’s actions will affect their current or future life) and ‘', 'samsara', '’ (the cycle of rebirth).', ""The interplay of these social, cultural and religious factors allows people to be accepting of life events and trajectories. However, this is not to be interpreted as Indians being unwilling to take responsibility for life circumstances. Many often contemplate how their actions may impact their future and make decisions accordingly. Some of India's youth are challenging a fatalistic perspective by asserting their free will to choose their vocation, spouse and other life factors. Indeed, as social mobility becomes more common, there is a growing belief that one can change their circumstances."", 'Modesty and Conservativeness', 'Indians tend to be quite conservative in most aspects of life, particularly in rural areas. This is especially noticeable in people’s behaviour and dress. Many will avoid speaking loudly or using excessive hand gestures, and it is not uncommon for strangers, friends and some family members of opposite genders to avoid physical contact. It is also preferable to wear clothing that covers the arms and legs; very few people wear revealing clothing. Clothing is usually traditional, but it is common to see Western-style clothing throughout the country for men and in urban areas for women.', 'Adaptability and Light-Heartedness', 'The large population size of India has not led average Indians to think of themselves as ‘one among many’ and certainly has not diminished their aspirations. Instead, diversity is celebrated alongside an inventive and entrepreneurial spirit. In this sense, many Indians are very adaptive and creative, often visualising big possibilities for themselves, their people and country. Problems are usually managed in a cheerful, cooperative and innovative manner, along with a light-heartedness towards situations that might otherwise be understood as frustrating. For example, strangers readily help others during mundane tasks such as looking for directions or parking a vehicle.']"
indonesian,"['{Face}', 'Courtesy', 'Harmony', 'Warmth', 'Gentleness', 'Filial piety', 'Unity', 'Appeasement', 'Indonesia is the largest Muslim-majority country in the world. It is also the biggest archipelago, consisting of over 17,500 islands. The dispersion of the islands means that distinct microcultures have developed to be regionally specific. Furthermore, over 300 ethnic groups are spread across Indonesia. The largest is the Javanese population (41%) that mostly occupies the island of Java. Others include, but are not limited to, the Sundanese, Malay, Batak, Madurese and Betawi people. Most ethnicities have languages, histories and cultures that pertain specifically to them. Hence, Indonesians tend to identify themselves locally foremost (according to their ', 'ethnicity', ', family or birthplace) before defining themselves nationally.', 'This general summary addresses the common principles and concepts that contribute to the values and behaviour of many Indonesians. However, Indonesians are so diverse that this overview will not be applicable to every individual. An Indonesian’s regional, linguistic and ethnic background must be considered in order to fully understand that individual’s cultural influences. For instance, one can observe dominant Indonesian culture to largely reflect characteristics of Javanese and Islamic society. Yet, the Balinese population, occupying the Island of Bali, are mostly Hindu. They follow different customs and traditions, have an alternate religious calendar and are divergent from other ethnic populations in many other ways.', 'This being said, there are cultural concepts of broader Asian culture that are recognizable throughout Indonesia. For example, ', 'face', "" is the quality embedded in most Asian cultures that indicates a person's reputation, influence, dignity and honour. By complimenting a person, showing them respect or doing something to increase their self-esteem, you give them "", 'face', '. Similarly, people can lose ', 'face', ' and save or build ', 'face', '. Therefore, individuals in Indonesia usually act deliberately and with ', 'restraint', ' to protect their self-worth and peer perception. Conservative conduct is the norm, as people don’t want to stand out and/or risk losing ', 'face', ' by doing something inappropriate.', 'Harmony', ' is also a guiding philosophy in Indonesia. It affects many features of society, particularly those of family and business. Working in ', 'harmony', ' is viewed as the crucial element for productivity; thus the Indonesians have a predisposition to be indirect, gentle and courteous – even if they disagree with what you are saying.\xa0Indonesia is also more collectivistic than Western societies. Individuals often perceive themselves to be members of ‘groups’ rather than autonomous actors. These groups reflect or come to define who its members are and often expect a high degree of loyalty. For example, the group’s interests usually supersede those of the individual, even if they conflict. Furthermore, group members expect to receive preferential treatment over anyone who is not part of the group. In return for this loyalty, an individual gains a sense of belonging, protection and unity. This is important as unity is considered essential to maintaining ', 'harmony', ' among all the diverse populaces.', 'This ', 'collectivism', ' also influences social behaviour. Due to the country’s high population density, people in Indonesia rarely do things or go places by themselves. Those who operate alone are sometimes pitied or even questioned about their solitary ways. Privacy doesn’t have the same value that it does in Western societies. People immerse themselves in others’ lives. Curiosity spurs gossip, and a person’s business easily becomes the community’s business.', 'Indonesian society is hierarchical, organised predominantly by age. One’s status, education and perceived power will demand degrees of deference, but age usually becomes the overriding factor determining the level of respect. Elders are presumed to have the most wisdom and are therefore considered the most deserving of authority. Indonesians may use honorific speech and bow slightly when talking to someone older than them. Women have full civil rights; the Islamic code that professes a separation between genders is not followed as stringently as it is in other Islamic countries. However, there is a distinct attitude in society that sees females as secondary to males.', 'Generally, Indonesians are very gracious people who enjoy affection and have a desire to please. By large, they respond well to those who show respect in the appropriate fashion and pay them recognition. By being warm, generous with your time and visibly displaying that you like them, you are likely to experience their enthusiasm and friendship.']"
japanese,"['Regional Character', '\xa0(Kenminsei)', 'Formality', 'Face', '\xa0(Menboku)', 'Politeness', 'Pragmatism', 'Pacifism', 'Artistry', 'Japan is an island country located in the northeast Pacific Ocean. Since the 1950s, the country has emerged as one of the most economically and technologically advanced societies in the world. This development has occurred alongside the continuation of intricate and longstanding cultural traditions. For example, modern buildings and high-rises can be found next to historical structures, temples and shrines. The historical trading route that ran from Tōkyō to Kyōto (known as ', 'Tōkaidō', ') continues to be heavily travelled, albeit on high-speed railroad lines and express highways. While the country develops and manufactures many of the world’s modern appliances and gadgets, families continue to pass on the skills and techniques of long-practised crafts through generations. This relationship between the past and future has become a globally recognised feature of Japanese culture and society.', 'Japanese culture is often stereotyped as homogenous, although there are multiple aspects of Japanese culture and society that are diverse. In particular, many take pride in their place of birth and the regional differences throughout Japan. Nonetheless, common themes found throughout Japanese culture include a sense of identity based on social groups and place of birth, a polite and humble style of communication, a pragmatic approach to situations and challenges, as well as an appreciation and enjoyment of artistic activities and forms of entertainment.', 'Geography and Landscapes', 'There are five main island groups that form Japan: Hokkaidō, Honshū, Shikoku, Kyūshū and Okinawa (also known as Ryūkyū Islands). Each region is geographically, historically and culturally distinct, particularly the northernmost island of Hokkaidō and the southernmost island cluster of Okinawa. Japan’s climate is generally monsoonal, governed by wet and dry seasonal winds. However, the country is home to numerous local climatic variations, ranging from heavy snowfall and sub-zero winter temperatures in Hokkaidō to the humid subtropical climate of Okinawa. These local variations of climate have influenced regional diversity in landscapes and material culture, such as cuisine and clothing. Japan is also home to approximately 1,500 volcanos, which have contributed to the common occurrence of earthquakes and other natural disasters.', 'Nature and landscapes play an important role throughout Japanese culture. For example, local animals (such as ', 'tanuki', ', bears and foxes) are often symbolic to a region’s identity and are woven through narratives in popular culture. Certain flora and fauna are also associated with the seasons; the summer rain occurring through June and July is commonly referred to as ', 'baiu', ' (plum rain) as it is the time when plums ripen. Similarly, ', 'sakura', ' (cherry blossom trees) are often associated with the coming of spring, while ', 'momiji', ' (maple trees) signify autumn. Seasonal blossom viewing is a popular cultural activity for both locals and tourists. While cherry blossom viewing in the springtime is most famous (in part due to the short-lived bloom of the flowers), other seasonal trees and flowers are celebrated across the year.', 'Urbanisation and Space', 'Many of Japan’s cities have an extensive history that can still be seen through architecture and city layouts. For instance, the old imperial capitals of Kyōto and Nara have largely retained their historical layout as a castle town. Almost all major cities were heavily damaged during World War II, which led to reconstruction of older structures, as well as new housing built in Western architectural styles. The large-scale industrialisation of the country in the post-war period led to mass urban migration. As a result, contemporary Japan is heavily urbanised, with approximately 91.8% of the population residing in urban areas located by the coastline or in the Kantō Plain.1 The country’s capital Tōkyō, located in east-central Honshū, is one of the world’s most populous cities (approximately 37 million).2', 'A common characteristic of Japanese cities is the diverse use of land, due to the absence of strict zoning in urban cities. For instance, an urban district may contain small shops, residential and office buildings, factories and green spaces all within walking distance. Some rural and regional towns and villages have retained traditional features, such as autonomous and cooperative agricultural practices. Nonetheless, such traditions are often combined with modern farming practices and employment diversification. With only approximately 12% of the land suitable for agriculture,3 most villages maintain commercial activities with nearby towns. Many who reside in regional areas temporarily or permanently move to urban areas for education and employment while others may commute weekly or seasonally to urban centres for industrial work.', 'The movement between regional and urban centres is facilitated by Japan’s highly developed and expansive transportation and communication networks. This connects some of the most remote regions to the rest of the country. Many of Japan’s regional hubs and major urban centres (such as Tōkyō, Nagoya, Ōsaka, Kyōto, Hiroshima and Fukuoka) are linked by ', 'shinkansen', ', which is colloquially known in English as the ‘bullet train’. In the past few decades, the widespread transportation system has helped facilitate the popularity of local tourism. It has also enabled people who cannot live in the inner-city to commute daily to work, though it is common for commuters to travel up to two hours each way.', 'Nihonjinron and Diversity', 'Japan and its culture has often been portrayed as ‘unique’ and ‘homogenous’ in public discourse, often to evoke a sense of nationalism.4 This rhetoric, in turn, has informed many foreign stereotypes by outsiders. These ideas imply that Japanese people and society are completely homogeneous, and that the cultural characteristics that define the country are unique to Japan. The notion of Japan’s uniqueness and ', 'homogeneity', ' as well as the literature on the topic is often referred to as ', 'nihonjinron', ', meaning “theories of Japanese-ness”. Though there are different strands and aspects of ', 'nihonjinron', ', such ideas commonly portray Japan as an ethnically homogenous and egalitarian society, and presume people share the same characteristics, behaviours and attitudes. These unique characteristics of Japanese people are seen as ‘mysterious’ and elusive, echoing Orientalist and essentialist ideas and stereotypes. Such ideas and theories have been explored since World War II, but became particularly popular in the late 20th century.5', 'Though overt expressions of ', 'nihonjinron', ' have lessened over the last couple of decades, it is not uncommon for Japanese people to encounter such attitudes from other Japanese (especially from the government) and non-Japanese. However, many observations indicate Japan is more diverse and ', 'heterogeneous', ' than theories of ', 'nihonjinron', ' suggest.6 For instance, there are many historical differences between the various regions of Japan that continue today. The country is also home to a number of indigenous and ethnic communities, such as the Ainu, Ryūkyūan and Koreans. Lifestyles in Japan vary across many different aspects of society, particularly between urban and rural settings. Thus, it is important to be mindful of assumptions that present Japanese culture and society as unusually unique or completely homogenous.', 'Regional Identity and Differences', 'Cultural diversity is highly noticeable across the different regions of Japan, each of which have their own distinct identity, cultural practices and traditions. Japan is divided into forty-seven prefectures (local government areas) that form the basis of these regional identities. Each prefecture varies in terms of size and political structure, and oversees matters relating to labour, health, education, social welfare, land preservation and development, as well as disaster prevention and control.', 'Historically, regional differences generally occurred across economic, political, social and cultural lines. However, many of these aspects of society are now monitored and standardised at the national level. This standardisation, along with the highly urbanised nature of contemporary Japan and extensive transportation and telecommunications networks, has led to regional differences becoming less pronounced. As such, today most distinctions usually relate to social and cultural practices (e.g. food, art, language, clothing). For example, the Kantō region (Tōkyō and surrounding areas) and the Kansai region (Ōsaka, Kyōto and surrounding areas) were once seen as economic, political and cultural competitors. While there is still a sense of competitiveness, most contemporary differences between the two major urban hubs relate more so to language, cuisine and architecture. Moreover, there are considerable variations within regions and prefectures.', 'Nonetheless, Japanese people often have a sense of pride associated with their prefecture. Thus, it is not uncommon to hear someone speak of a regional or prefectural character ', '(kenminsei)', ', rather than a Japanese national character ', '(nihonkokuminsei)', '.7 The identity and culture of a prefecture is often symbolised through an aspect of material culture, such as local cuisine, dialects, distinctive folk crafts and traditional performing arts. Regions are commonly associated with a famous local product created with locally sourced resources or unique industries to the area, such as ceramics, tools or handicrafts. Sometimes, regional identity is also connected to personality traits or social characteristics and attitudes. For instance, those from Tōkyō are sometimes considered to be more formal and hierarchical, while those from Ōsaka are oftentimes seen as informal and pragmatic.8', 'Ethnic and Linguistic Composition', 'Japan is a fairly ethnically and linguistically homogeneous society, with the majority of the population being ethnic Japanese ', '(Yamoto)', '. Similarly, the official and most commonly spoken language is Japanese ', '(Nihongo). ', 'Spoken and written forms of Japanese are standardised throughout the country, largely due to the creation of a national education system and the use in government and business communication. Standardised Japanese is based on the dialect spoken in Tōkyō. However, there are varying dialects and linguistic peculiarities across different ethnic groups and regions. Speakers of regional and local dialects can often understand one another, though certain words or phrases may be incomprehensible. Older generations tend to speak in their regional dialects. People may also have distinctive accents depending on which part of Japan they are from.', 'There are also a number of ethnically or culturally distinct groups in Japan, such as the indigenous Ainu and Ryūkyūan populations, as well as ethnic Koreans. These groups have an extensive history in Japan yet continue to face numerous unique challenges as minority groups, being relatively small in terms of population size. The Japanese census does not record data on the ethnic composition of the population, but rather by nationality (see ', 'Nationality and Citizenship', '). Nonetheless, the following provides a brief overview of Japan’s ethnic groups.', 'Japanese (Yamato)', 'The term ‘Japanese’ is often used to refer to the dominant ethnic group in Japan. There are various Japanese and English terms used to refer to those who are ethnically Japanese, such as ', 'Yamato', ', ', 'Nihonjin', ', ‘ethnic Japanese’, ‘Japanese people’ or simply ‘Japanese’. Those who are ethnically Japanese make up the overwhelming majority of the population. Some people consider the Ainu and Ryūkyūan indigenous groups as ethically Japanese yet genetically distinct from the Yamato. However, others may not necessarily accept this categorisation. Most of the information in this cultural summary describes Yamato cultural practices.', 'Ainu', 'The Ainu are an indigenous people who mostly reside in the northernmost island of Hokkaidō, with some residing in northern Honshū and the Sakhalin and Kuril islands in Russia. Estimates suggest that there are approximately 24,000 Ainu in Japan.9 Though previously living throughout northern Japan, the expansion of Japanese settlement throughout the past millennium pushed the Ainu further northward until the government of the Meiji period (1868-1912) confined them to Hokkaidō.10 Consequently, the last two centuries has seen the Ainu population significantly dwindle due to diseases and low birth rates.11 Many aspects of traditional Ainu culture have largely disappeared and only a small number are fluent in the Ainu language, which is classified as ‘critically endangered’.12 Attempts to preserve the Ainu language have mainly been through poetry and songs passed down orally over generations. Though the Ainu people have widely adapted their lifestyles to Japanese mainstream society, many have sought to recover lost cultural traditions.13', 'The view of Japan as an ethnically homogenous society has seen the Ainu face challenges in gaining social and legal recognition as an ethnically distinct and indigenous people. Ainu also encounter economic and social marginalisation, such as access to education, employment opportunities, hate speech, and inter-ethnic marriage. Progress in recent years has sought to address the marginalisation of the Ainu.14 For example, a new act passed in 2019 that formally acknowledges the Ainu as an indigenous people and attempts to adopt proactive measures that support and protect Ainu cultural identity.15', 'Ryūkyūan', 'The Ryūkyūan (also referred to as Okinawans) are another ethnic group of Japan that reside primarily in the southernmost island cluster of Okinawa (also known as Ryūkyū Islands). The Ryūkyūan comprises several groups with distinct languages and cultural practices. The exact numbers of those who identify as Ryūkyūan in Japan are unknown. However there are approximately 1.4 million residents throughout Okinawa,16 most of whom are indigenous Ryūkyūan (although there has been some migration of ethnic Japanese to these islands). There are also large Okinawan ', 'diaspora', ' communities in Brazil, Peru, Argentina and Hawai’i.17', 'The distinctive climate and geographical distance of the Ryūkyū Islands from the main islands of Japan led Ryūkyūans to develop distinctive political, cultural and religious traditions, as well as unique languages.18 While Ryūkyūan languages and Japanese are thought to have common origins, the former is incomprehensible to Japanese visitors.19 The various local languages in Okinawa, such as Uchināguchi, Amami, Miyako, Yaeyama and Yonaguni are all recognised as ‘severely’ or ‘definitely’ endangered languages.20 Many Ryūkyūans seek to affirm their heritage and culture through a number of ways. For instance, aspects of traditional Ryūkyūan culture are often celebrated and shared through cuisine and music.', '', 'It is widely believed that Ryūkyūans are indigenous to Japan. However, the Japanese government does not formally recognise the status of Okinawans as indigenous people.21 There have been tensions between Ryūkyūans and Japanese (particularly the government) since World War II, mainly due to the immense loss of Okinawans during the war and the United States’ subsequent occupation of Okinawa until 1972.22 The US has had a continued military presence on the main island of Okinawa since, with up to 75% of US military bases in Japan located on Okinawa Island.23 These military bases occupy up to 20% of the land, much of which was historically used for agricultural purposes.24', 'Korean', 'Koreans make up the second largest ethnic group in Japan, with estimates suggesting approximately one million Korean permanent residents or citizens reside in the country.25 Many live around major industrial and economic centres, such as Ōsaka and Tōkyō. The presence of a large ethnically Korean population in Japan reflects an extensive and complex history between the two regions, particularly during the early to mid-twentieth century. Japan’s colonial rule over the Korean Peninsula from 1910 to 1945 saw hundreds of thousands of Koreans relocate to Japan to work as labourers in various industries, such as mining and construction.26 This migration was particularly high during World War II as many Korean men and women were drafted to participate and aid in Japan’s war efforts.27 By 1945, there were approximately 2.3 million Koreans living in Japan. Nearly three-quarters returned to Korea within the first six months after the end of World War II, while approximately 600,000 chose to remain.28', 'Those Koreans who remained in Japan faced discrimination and significant barriers, particularly regarding citizenship. Many were faced with the choice to either renounce their Korean citizenship in order to become Japanese citizens, or remain as Korean citizens residing in Japan. This choice continues to impact ethnic Koreans in Japan today. Some families who accepted Japanese citizenship have assimilated into society and adopted Japanese names. However, there is an overwhelming number of Koreans permanently residing in Japan who do not have Japanese citizenship – often described as ', 'zainichi Koreans', ' (‘Koreans staying in Japan’). They often encounter discrimination in employment and promotions, accessing social welfare, exercising civil and political rights as well as social stigmas and stereotypes.29 Some may use Japanese names as a way to avoid social discrimination.30', 'Experiences and attitudes within the Korean community tend to differ among generations. The first generation has generally remained committed and loyal to their home country and their identity as Korean. They make up a smaller proportion of the Korean community yet continue to have considerable influence over Korean organisations in Japan. Many may maintain hope of eventually returning to Korea. Second- and third-generation Koreans tend to experience more ambivalence about their relationship to Korean and Japanese culture. Many have struggled to retain their Korean identity, having limited knowledge of the Korean language, history and culture. Simultaneously, many have studied in Japanese educational institutions, speak Japanese as their first language and intend to live in Japan permanently.', 'Nationality and Citizenship', 'Nationality and citizenship status is a common focal point in Japan’s public discourse due to the lack of official data on ', 'ethnicity', '. The Japanese census does not record data on the ethnic composition of the population, but rather by nationality. This means that all Japanese citizens (naturalised or by ancestry) are recorded as “Japanese”, regardless of their ethnic identity.', 'Further, Japanese law adopts an ancestral rather than territorial principle of nationality. This means citizenship is determined according to whether an individual has at least one parent who is a Japanese citizen, rather than according to the nation of one’s birth.31 As such, children of foreign nationals born in Japan cannot obtain Japanese citizenship (unless becoming naturalised).32 Meanwhile, children born to a parent who is a Japanese national automatically become Japanese citizens at birth, regardless of where they are born. This has implications for certain ethnic groups. For example, those without Japanese citizenship cannot register themselves or their family in the ', 'koseki', ' (family registration system), which distinguishes them from Japanese citizens.33', 'Historical Transitions and Current Attitudes', 'Imperial Japan and World War II', 'Historical events that occurred over the last century have had profound cultural, societal, political and economic effects throughout the whole of Japan. In 1868, the ', 'Meiji Restoration', ' instated imperial rule over Japan, marking the beginning of the historical Japanese empire (referred to as the ‘Empire of Japan’ or ‘Imperial Japan)’. This was a time known for massive reforms, such as rapid industrialisation and the end of the societal dominance of the warrior class ', '(samurai). ', 'The state was headed by the Emperor who was deemed as ‘sacred and inviolable’ and held supreme command over the military.', 'By the early 20th century, Imperial Japan had annexed land from surrounding territories, including Taiwan (1895), the Korean Peninsula (1910) and parts of China (1931). The country declared war against the United States and the United Kingdom in 1941 amongst growing international concerns of its expansion and increasing military strength. This marked the beginning of the four-year-long Pacific War (1941-1945), fought between the Allied Forces against Japan as part of World War II throughout the Pacific Ocean, East Asia, Southeast Asia and Oceania. The numerous and complex battles that occurred saw mass casualties and destruction throughout the region.', 'Much of the devastation within Japan occurred in the lead-up to the end of the war in 1945. Massive air raids over dozens of Japanese cities saw widespread destruction of many factories and homes, many of which were built of inflammable materials like wood and plaster structures, causing the fires to spread rapidly. The air raid in Tokyō alone killed 80,000 and left nearly one million homeless.35 The most catastrophic event occurred when the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki were hit with atomic bombs on August 6th and 9th respectively. The combination of the heat and blast reduced everything in the immediate vicinity of the explosion into cinders or rubble, and caused spontaneous fires to break out some distance away. Hundreds of thousands either died, were immediately injured, or subsequently suffered from the effects of radiation poisoning.36 Two weeks later, Imperial Japan formally surrendered, thus marking the end of the Pacific War.', 'Post-War Rebuilding', 'The casualties of the Pacific War were enormous for all countries and regions involved. Estimates suggest three million Japanese people, including up to 800,000 civilians, were killed due to military action, and hundreds of thousands more from disease and starvation.37 Approximately 30% of Japan’s entire urban population lost their homes, and 66 Japanese cities saw 40% of their built-up areas destroyed.38 The cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki also suffered the lasting damage caused by the atomic explosions and subsequent radiation. Much of the population became disillusioned with the cultural and social frameworks of pre-war and wartime Japan.', 'From 1945 to 1952, Japan was occupied by the Allied Forces under the command of US General Douglas MacArthur. The early postwar years brought a massive overhaul to Japan’s political and economic structures, as well as large-scale rebuilding of the country’s urban centres. The 1889 ', 'Meiji Constitution', ' was heavily revised, and the new Japanese constitution came into effect in 1947. Though Japan remained a constitutional monarchy, Shintō was removed as the state religion and the Emperor renounced both his divinity and political power. His function became mainly one of ceremonial and symbolic purposes. ', 'Democratic', ' principles such as universal suffrage were also enacted, and all territories annexed after 1895 were returned. Constitutional reforms were followed by economic reforms, particularly in agricultural land distribution and the reinstatement of trade unions.39 Such economic reforms helped the country rapidly develop to eventually become one of the world’s leading economies (see ', 'Social Stratification and Education', ').', 'Pacifist Attitudes', 'One area of reform that continues to influence contemporary Japanese society is the demilitarisation of the country. Article 9 of the Constitution states that Japan has forever renounced war as a sovereign right of the nation, international disputes would not be settled through threat or the use of force, and armed forces with war potential will not be maintained.40 These constitutional reforms to Japan’s military and the introduction of a pacifist foreign policy approach was widely welcomed by the population. Since then, much of Japan’s national identity has centered on a discourse of peace and ', 'pacifism', ', which can be found in politics, media, schools and other public institutions (especially museums) across the country.41 One example is how official documents representing Japan often describe the country as a ‘peace nation’ ', '(heiwa kokka)', '.42', 'Pacifist attitudes are also prevalent throughout the population.43 For example, one survey found that, when asked whether Japan should play a more active military role in the Asia-Pacific region, just over two-thirds (68%) wanted Japan to limit its military activity.44 Attempts to reinterpret or amend Article 9 of the Constitution often lead to rigorous public debates. Part of the debate centres on the creation of the Japan Self-Defence Forces (JSDF) in 1954. Originally, the Japan Self-Defence Forces were never to be used outside Japan. However, subsequent participation of Japan in UN peacekeeping missions or disaster relief work has been controversial both in Japan and abroad, particularly among countries that were victims of Japanese aggression during the Pacific War (see ', 'Other Considerations', ').', 'Views on the hypothetical amendment of Article 9 vary on a scale ranging from pacifists who believe Article 9 should be maintained and the Japan Self-Defence Forces is unconstitutional, to nationalists who believe Japan should revise Article 9 to allow the country to remilitarise and build nuclear capabilities.45 However, despite public debates and diversity of views, many Japanese tend to lean more towards maintaining a pacifist stance. For instance, a recent public opinion poll found that 69% of respondents oppose a revision to Article 9, with just over three-quarters (76.2%) of those believing that the article made a significant contribution to peace and stability.46', 'Social Stratification and Education', 'Japan has experienced rapid economic growth since overhauls to its economic structure in the post-war era. Today, it is the third largest industrialised market economy,47 and one of the world’s leading countries in manufacturing (particularly automobiles, electronics, machinery and tools, optical and precision equipment, and chemicals).48 Japan also has one of the largest consumer markets,49 with just under two-thirds (65%) of the working population falling within the middle-income class bracket.50 Overall, household inequalities tend to be less pronounced in Japan than in other developed countries.51 However, there are socioeconomic differences that often vary between ethnic groups, social classes and rural-urban regions.', 'Lower socioeconomic classes in Japan are commonly associated with those employed in unskilled, low-paying jobs and manual or physically demanding labour. Such forms of employment are often referred to as the three undesirable Ks: ', 'kitanai', ' (dirty), ', 'kitsui', ' (difficult) and ', 'kiken', ' (dangerous).52 Japan’s rapidly ageing population has led to shortages in the workforce available to undertake these physical jobs. As such, they have become increasingly undertaken by foreign workers over the past twenty years, as well as the ', 'burakumin', '.53', 'The ', 'burakumin', ' are one of the largest minority groups in Japan, thought to have an ancestral connection to the lowest social class during the feudal period (1185-1600 CE). Traditionally, their occupations related to impure ', '(kegare)', ' tasks, such as butchers and leatherworkers. ', 'Burakumin', ' are not racially or ethnically different from Japanese and there are no biological differences or other means of distinguishing them. Rather, the ‘status’ of ', 'burakumin', ' is assumed from the location of one’s family home or occupation. Estimates suggest there are between one to three million ', 'burakumin', ' in Japan.54 Ongoing prejudice has seen many live in secluded communities under relative impoverishment.55 They can also face significant challenges and discrimination in education attainment, employment opportunities and marriage.56 In recent years, there have been efforts made to help reduce such social stigmatism and prejudice.57', 'Education is highly valued in Japan and is viewed as an important means of social and economic mobility. This can be seen in the level of educational performance and attainment. For instance, Japan is consistently one of the highest performing nations in mathematics, science and reading literacy among the ', 'OECD', ' countries.58 Moreover, approximately 62% of those between the ages of 25 to 34 had a tertiary degree in 2019, compared to the ', 'OECD', ' average of 44.9%.59 A university or college degree is the usual prerequisite for most middle-class occupations. Some companies restrict recruitment to graduates of specific universities, which adds to the pressure of gaining entrance into the country’s most prestigious institutions. However, academic expectations tend to be less strenuous at university or college, especially since graduation from the country’s top universities often leads students into high-paying companies.', 'Uchi-Soto Groups and Hierarchy', 'Social hierarchies play an important role in Japanese culture, often influencing social behaviour and communication. People tend to be highly attentive to the social status and relation of the person they are speaking with, as this dictates the honorific expressions and levels of respectful speech ', '(keigo)', ' used in Japanese conversation. Similarly, etiquette and behaviour shows deference to these social ranks. For example, it is customary for the most senior member of the family (typically the father or grandfather) to partake in activities such as bathing or eating first, followed by the rest of the family in order of seniority.', 'The way these hierarchies operate may also be influenced by the level of familiarity one has to a person. Indeed, people tend to draw a distinction between those they consider part of their inner circle (the in-', 'group', ') and those they do not (the out-', 'group', '). This is commonly expressed through the related concepts of ', 'uchi', ' (‘inside’) and ', 'soto ', '(‘outside’), a foundational concept in Japanese customs and sociolinguistics. Such categories extend past one’s personal relationships and social groups to all aspects of life. For instance, an individual may consider their work colleagues ', ""'uchi'"", ' and competing companies ', ""'soto'"", '. The ', 'uchi-soto', ' distinction often determines the way someone behaves and conducts themselves around other people, as well as the kind of respectful speech they use to communicate to others (see ', 'Verbal', ' in ', 'Communication', ').', 'As a broad generalisation, one usually shows more ', 'politeness', ' and respect to those from outside groups ', '(soto)', ' that they want to impress. For example, a visitor to the household (considered ', 'soto', ') will be given precedence over the most senior member of the family (considered ', 'uchi', ', the in-group). Nonetheless, ', 'uchi-soto', ' distinctions and social hierarchies are often very fluid, as categories may overlap and change over time. They may also vary depending on the social context or different identity markers (e.g. gender, age, ', 'ethnicity', ', nationality). Indeed, Japan is considered to be not as rigidly hierarchical as most of its neighbouring cultures.60 One example is the consensus-based decision making process found in government and corporate businesses, known as ', 'nemawashi', ' (see ', 'Decision Making, Nemawashi and Hierarchy', ' in ', 'Business Culture', ').', 'Face (Menboku), Collectivism and Harmony (Wa)', 'Behaviour and communication in Japan tends to be informed by the concept of face ', '(menboku)', '. As a concept found in many Asian cultures, ‘', 'face', '’ refers to a person’s reputation, pride and honour, and can be saved or lost depending on the circumstances. As such, individuals tend to act and communicate in a deliberate manner and with ', 'restraint', ' in order to maintain their face. Part of the motivation to act appropriately is not only self-reputation, but also the consequence an individual’s behaviour may have on their collective group.', 'Japanese society is generally collectivistic, whereby people often view themselves and others as members of a collective unit or group (whether it be ', 'uchi', ' or ', 'soto', ' groups, a family group or a broader social group). In this sense, members of a group hold collective responsibility ', '(rentai sekinin)', ' for the performance and actions of an individual.61 For instance, if one or a few members of the group indulge in poor behaviour, all others are collectively blamed. In turn, ', 'harmony', ' ', '(wa)', ' is an important part of interpersonal relationships. As a cultural concept, ', 'harmony', ' implies a sense of unity and conformity within a group, whereby ', 'interdependence', ' may be emphasised over independence.', 'However, individualist attitudes are also prevalent in Japanese culture. Gradual social changes to the ', 'kinship', ' system and community has seen individuals more closely connected to their inner circle than their extended groups.62 Moreover, individuals are often not only defined by their interactions and associations with others, but also through their individual personality. The individuality of people, especially those who seem sincere and hardworking, is often celebrated.63 Meanwhile, those who act out of self-interest without regard for others are frowned upon. The presence of both collectivist and individualist attitudes in Japanese culture means that it is often seen as collectivist from the perspective of the English-speaking West, and individualist from the perspective of neighbouring Asian cultures.64', 'Uncertainty Avoidance and Pragmatism', 'According to Hofstede Insights, Japan has one of the most uncertainty avoidant cultures in the world (with a score of 92 out of 100).65 This means people tend to be more comfortable with consistency and predictability, and look to create rules and social conventions that reduce ambiguity in situations. Japan’s ', 'uncertainty avoidance', ' is partly attributed to the constant threat of natural disasters such as earthquakes, tsunamis and typhoons, which require people to be prepared for such contingencies. However, it also extends to other aspects of society.', 'Indeed, Japan is also a ', 'high context culture', "", meaning people share a complex body of 'understood' values and experiences that inform daily interaction. As such, daily life is prescribed by many implicit "", 'norms', ' and social rules governing conduct and behaviour. This is especially evident when considering the various expectations of etiquette (see ', 'Etiquette', '). For instance, punctuality is the norm for meetings, appointments and visits. This expectation is carried through to services, such as public transport arriving exactly at the expected time. Such ', 'norms', ' maintain the social order and remove ambiguity surrounding how one should behave across different contexts.', 'As part of mitigating uncertainty, it is common to find people adopting pragmatic approaches to situations. People often avoid limiting themselves to finding the ‘right solution’ to a situation, but rather seek out a variety of approaches and consider innovative or different ideas.', 'Artistic and Literary Culture', 'Artistry and literature have played an important role in Japanese culture for centuries. Today, many Japanese support, appreciate and participate in artistic culture, regardless of the form it takes. The government also encourages artistic endeavours (particularly of traditional arts) through the support and patronage of institutions such as schools, museums and libraries. Great effort is made to preserve traditional arts and crafts, with many being designated as ', 'mukei bunkazai', ' (‘intangible cultural property’) and particular artists or important figures of artistry regarded as ', 'ningen kokuhō', ' (‘living national treasures’).', 'The types and forms of art enjoyed throughout the country are diverse. For example, European artistic forms (such as classical and orchestral music) are popular and there are various institutions that allow for people to pursue careers as professional classical musicians. Japan is also one of the world’s leading manufacturers of classical instruments. Traditional Japanese forms of art are also widely celebrated. For instance, performance art such as puppet theatre ', '(bunraku)', ' and stylised dramas ', '(noh ', 'and', ' kabuki)', ' are still enjoyed by many, while fine art such as calligraphy ', '(shodō)', ', woodblock printing ', '(ukiyo-e)', ', paper folding ', '(origami)', ' and ceramics continue to be circulated and practised, gaining global popularity. Other traditional cultural activities like the tea ceremony ', '(sadō)', ', flowering arranging ', '(ikebana)', ' and growing miniature trees ', '(bonsai)', ' are often viewed as art forms and can take years of training.', 'Much of Japan’s contemporary artistry, especially film and television, literature and music, have been developed from older artistic and literary traditional art forms. Japanese artistic endeavours over the last few decades have made major contributions to global contemporary art, especially in the fields of architecture, graphic design, textiles and fashion. In particular, Japanese artists continually play a major role in the development of video games and animation (', 'anime', '), both of which are widely enjoyed both in Japan and abroad.', 'Reading is one of the most consumed forms of entertainment throughout the country. For example, newspapers are still widely influential despite readership declining in favour of more digital forms of media and news.66 Although the sale of books and magazines has declined in favour of electronic versions, Japan continues to be one of the world’s biggest publishers of books and translated works. Another particularly popular medium that has gained worldwide popularity are comics or graphic novels ', '(manga).', ' Produced in a variety of genres, manga is read by people of all ages in Japan, especially among salary workers during their commute to work.', '_____________________', '1 Central Intelligence Agency, 20202 Central Intelligence Agency, 20203 World Bank, 20164 Brown, 20175 Brown, 20176 Sugimoto, 20217 Sugimoto, 20218 Sugimoto, 20219 Minority Rights Group International, 2018a10 Dolan & Worden, 199411 Dolan & Worden, 199412 Moseley, 201013 Minority Rights Group International, 2018a14 Minority Rights Group International, 2018a15 Minority Rights Group International, 2018a; Umeda, 201916 Center for Okinawan Studies, 201017 Fukasawa, 2015; Center for Okinawan Studies, 201018 Minority Rights Group International, 2018d19 Minority Rights Group International, 2018d20 Moseley, 201021 Minority Rights Group International, 2018d22 Ray, 202023 Hein & Selden, 200324 Minority Rights Group International, 2018d25 Minority Rights Group International, 2018c26 Sugimoto, 2021; Minority Rights Group International, 2018c27 Minority Rights Group International, 2018c; Lee & Lew, 202028 Sugimoto, 2021; Minority Rights Group International, 2018c29 Sugimoto, 2021; Minority Rights Group International, 2018c30 Tamura, 200331 Sugimoto, 2021; Ministry of Justice, 200832 Ministry of Justice, 200833 Sugimoto, 202134 The Constitution of the Empire of Japan, 188935 Ray, 201736 Ray, 201737 Ishikida, 200538 Ray, 201739 Dolan & Worden, 199440 The Constitution of Japan, 1947.

lao,"['Politeness', 'Modesty', '{Face}', 'Harmony', 'Respect', 'Diversity', ""Officially known as the Lao People's "", 'Democratic', ' Republic (Lao PDR), Laos is located in Southeast Asia. It is the only landlocked country in the region, bordered by China, Vietnam, Cambodia, Thailand and Myanmar (Burma). Laos is incredibly diverse in terms of ethnic and linguistic groups. Nonetheless, most Lao share common values, attitudes and collective experiences. For example, many Lao have a collectivistic outlook and seek to maintain ', 'harmony', ' and honour among their family, friends and communities. Additionally, most Lao have experienced hardships resulting from the events of the Indochina Wars. Despite adversities on a national or local level, Lao are often warm and modest people who find contentment in their day-to-day lives.', 'Geography and Space', ""Laos has the lowest population density of any country in the Southeast Asia region. The most densely populated areas in the country are in and around the capital city of Vientiane. Along with Vientiane, many of Laos' major cities and towns are located along the banks of the Mekong River. The Mekong is the 12th longest river in the world and has historically been the economic and cultural focal point of Laos. The centrality of the Mekong continues today as the river remains the primary channel for transportation, fishing, trade, irrigation and tourism."", 'Over half of the population (59.3%) reside in the rural areas of Laos. As such, Laos is mostly united through agriculture, particularly rice cultivation. Many Lao live in villages that range from a few houses to several hundred. In every lowland village, there is a Buddhist temple, which is the main centre for social and recreational activities. In turn, each village supports at least one monk who oversees the local temple.', 'Ethnicity and Language', 'Laos is ethnically and linguistically diverse, with some estimates indicating there are more than 100 known ethnic groups in the country. Many of the ethnic groups in Laos speak their own languages and dialects, with some of the minority languages having no written form. Typically, the Lao population is categorised into three main ethnic groups depending on their geographic location. However, people will generally identify as ‘Lao’ foremost, followed by their ethnic group.', 'Lao Loum', ""The Lao Loum (‘lowlanders') consists of those who are ethnically Lao, with most Lao Loum occupying the lowlands of the country. The Lao Loum generally reside on the banks of the Mekong. It is believed that many of the ethnic groups under Lao Loum are descendants of the Tai people (not to be confused with Thai from modern-day Thailand). Ethnic Lao is the largest ethnic group found in Laos, making up just over half of the total population (53.2%). The official language of the country is Lao, the native language of the ethnic Lao. Many Lao can also speak and understand Thai due to the similarities between the two languages. Moreover, many Lao consume a lot of Thai media. However, the Lao language and Thai language are quite distinct from one another."", 'Lao Theung', ""The second largest ethnic category in Laos is the Lao Theung (‘highlanders'), located in the central and southern mountains of Laos. This ethnic category contains those of Austroasiatic origin and belongs to the Mon-Khmer language family. The largest ethnic group within the Lao Theung is the Khmu, located primarily in northern Laos. Along with the Khmu, there are over 20 other ethnic groups such as the Makong and Katang. The Lao Theung have been experiencing changes to their lifestyles and cultures due to increasing pressure from recent land reform programmes."", 'Lao Sung', ""The Lao Sung (‘mountain people') is the smallest ethnic category, made up of more than 30 tribes located in the mountainous regions of Laos. The two principal groups are the Hmong (at times referred to as Meo or Miao) and the Yao (sometimes known as lu Mien, Man or Mien). It is believed that the Hmong and Yao are descendants of ethnic groups once located in southern China. Many Hmong live in hiding in the jungles of Laos in fear of being persecuted for their grandparents’ decision to support the US army during the Second Indochina War. Many Hmong have attempted to flee over the border into Thailand. Nevertheless, relations between the current Lao government and the Hmong are improving, as seen from the greater representation of Hmong men and women in the political sphere."", 'Interethnic Relations', 'While much of the population fits into one of the three ethnic categories of Lao Loum, Lao Theung and Lao Sung, there are several other ethnic groups in the country. For example, there are many ethnic Vietnamese and Chinese residing in Laos. The ethnic and linguistic diversity of the country has played a significant role in shaping contemporary Laos. Throughout Lao history, ethnic diversity has produced, at times, a turbulent relationship among ethnic groups. These complex relations remain a crucial part of the national identity of Laos.', 'Complicating matters further, the geopolitical position and borders of Laos are creations of centuries of colonialism, regional conflicts, foreign interventions and revolutions. The boundaries of the ancient kingdoms throughout the Southeast Asia region for the most part have disappeared. Modern-day borders do not reflect the ethnic dispersion of people in the region. Indeed, the northeast region of Thailand was once a part of Laos. Today, there is an ethnic group known as ‘', 'khon Isan', '’ (‘people of the Isan region’) who communicate in Lao and are ethnically similar to ethnic Lao. The Lao language spoken in Laos and northeast Thailand is very similar, and people from Isan and Laos understand each other. However, Lao-Isan has been influenced by the modern-day Thai language; thus, there are some distinctions.', 'The Indochina Wars', 'Throughout modern Lao history, the country has had interactions with various other countries from the Western world. These interactions have made a significant impact on Lao culture. The first notable interaction between Laos and the West was the ', 'colonisation', ' of the country by France. Following its ', 'colonisation', ' of Vietnam, France began to incorporate much of Lao territory into the French empire. A treaty between France and Thailand in 1907 defined the present-day boundaries of Laos.', 'Interactions between Laos and France continued well into the mid-20th century. During the First Indochina War (1946-1954), the ‘', 'Pathet Lao', '’\xa0(‘Land of Laos’) was formed – a communist resistance organisation associated with a Vietnamese counterpart, the Viet Minh. These two forces set out to gain independence from the French for the respective countries. Eventually, Laos gained independence from the French in 1953. However, the country quickly became subsumed into the Second Indochina War (1954-1975), which is often referred to in the English-speaking West as the Vietnam War.', ""During the early 1970s, the United States intensely bombed Lao territory to disrupt the Ho Chi Minh Trail, which ran from North Vietnam through Laos, ending in South Vietnam. However, the bombing extended well beyond the trail and lasted for nearly a decade, leaving permanent craters and unexploded bombs in many rural areas. The impacts of the Second Indochina War remain to this day. For example, the expansion of land for cultivation has been severely impeded due to large quantities of unexploded ordnance throughout the country's potential farmlands. In turn, only a small portion of Laos' total arable land is cultivated. Moreover, many live with a constant sense of uncertainty as to the location of the unexploded bombs."", 'Since the end of the Second Indochina War, migration from Laos has increased significantly. Indeed, it is estimated that 10% of the Lao population sought refugee status, with many resettling in France, the United States and Australia. Some refugees were survivors of the Hmong ‘secret army’, while others were among the country’s educated and professional elite. Many Lao do not like to discuss the Second Indochina War because of its tragic effects on the country’s economy, stability and the Lao people. Present-day perceptions of the war and America differ depending on the individual and their experiences. For the most part, the younger generation of Lao are more accepting towards the United States. The aftermath of the war still directly impacts daily life, and the country continues to rebuild from these events.', 'Harmony and Honour', 'At times, Lao may come across as reserved and modest when interacting with others, mainly due to the concept of ', 'face', '. Informing the way in which Lao behave and communicate to one another, the concept of ', 'face', "" refers to a person's or collective's reputation, dignity and honour. Through actions such as complimenting a person or demonstrating respect, one can give "", 'face', "". Moreover, pointing out someone's error, criticising another or raising one's voice are all seen as actions that can cause the loss of "", 'face', ' and bring shame.', 'Generally speaking, conservative conduct is the norm in Laos as people wish to maintain ', 'harmony', ' between each other. Indeed, Lao place a high value on ', 'harmony', ' and unity with others, keeping a secure network with their community and relatives. To preserve peace and minimise the risk of losing ', 'face', ', Lao are often contemplative and deliberate in how they present themselves. Many Lao seem to have a calm disposition, while simultaneously avoiding excessive displays of negative emotions (such as anger or selfishness) or outbursts. This is done in part to maintain the ', 'face', "" and honour of one's self, family or community."", 'Baci Ceremony', 'A cultural practice found across Laos is the ‘', 'sou\xa0khouan', '’\xa0or\xa0‘', 'bac', 'i’ ceremony. The baci is a general ceremony that occurs throughout a person’s life cycle or events that mark a transition in a person’s life. For example, the ceremony occurs when one is born, getting married, entering into monkhood, leaving home, returning home, and at the beginning of a new year.', ""In a\xa0baci, strings are tied around a person's wrist as a means to preserve good luck or good fortune in life. It is believed that the strings must never be cut and should not be removed for at least three days after being tied. Many people will leave the strings on for longer, with some keeping them until the strings disintegrate months later. The baci also involves offerings, food and religious chanting by a ‘"", 'maw\xa0phawn', '’\xa0(‘wish priest’).', 'Fatalism and Contentment', 'Fatalism', ' refers to the idea that events are predetermined, to the extent that one is unable to change them. The idea of ', 'fatalism', ' plays a large role in the perspectives adopted by Lao, as they will often contemplate how their actions will impact their future while being quite accepting of the outcome. This is not to be interpreted as Lao having an unwillingness to take responsibility for life circumstances; rather this sense of ', 'fatalism', ' usually translates into an acceptance of the events and trajectories of an individual’s life.', 'The Lao expression of “', 'bo penh\xa0ngan', ""”, which means ‘nevermind' or ‘no problem', reflects the Lao tendency towards acceptance and contentment. For many Lao, life should be enjoyed at the current moment, and problems should not be taken so seriously as to disrupt the enjoyment. Indeed, many Lao are concerned with making sure everything has some sense of ‘"", 'muan', '’ (‘fun’). This can be seen in the way some Lao inject playfulness and fun into mundane activities. For example, it is common to see Lao people smiling and laughing when interacting with others.']"
malaysian,"['Gentleness', '‘', 'Budi', '’', 'Respect', 'Courtesy', 'Modesty', 'Face', 'Filial piety', 'Diversity', 'Malaysia is an incredibly diverse country, containing many different ethnicities, languages and religions. People from each ', 'ethnicity', "" have generally retained their ancestors’ cultural customs. As a result, Malaysian society accommodates a rich variety of lifestyles, beliefs and values. The following information describes general Malaysian culture, tending to reflect the Malay majority; however, there are many divergences from this cultural mainstream throughout the country. Learning as much as possible about your Malaysian counterparts' home region, "", 'ethnicity', ' and religion beforehand can help you develop respectful relationships with them.', 'Indigenous Ethnicities', 'The majority of Malaysians (around 51%) are Malays. Almost all of them are Muslim, which explains why the ', 'ethnicity', ' is commonly referred to as ‘Muslim Malay’. Being the most populous ', 'ethnicity', ', they dominate the political sphere. Their predominance is reflected in the official religion (Islam) and language of the country. For example, most communities speak a version of Malay (officially known as Bahasa Malaysia) to some degree. While most Malays live in urban areas, they are traditionally associated with the rural hinterlands.', 'Malays often have a fatalistic worldview, leading them to attribute successes, opportunities and misfortunes to the will of God. Furthermore, care and attention to human interactions may be prioritised over deadlines or monetary success. Malay culture perceives courtesy and respect as principal moral values that should take precedence over others. Prosperity is derived from nobility, not necessarily the accumulation of wealth. Because of these cultural attitudes, members of the Malay majority tend to be less focused on economic pursuits than other ethnic groups. However, that has been negatively misconstrued as somehow suggesting a cultural lack of ambition or even laziness. On the contrary, it reflects the Malay view that relationship building is especially important and should not be approached lightly. They tend to be family-oriented people, choosing not to work overseas as much as other ethnicities and instead living within close proximity of their family networks.', 'Aboriginal ethnicities make up 11.8% of the population. Though they are a minority of the national population, they are the majority in the less urbanised regions of East Malaysia. Being the oldest inhabitants of Malaysia, these aboriginal communities often have traditional languages, religions and customs particular to their tribe. While they are collectively referred to as ‘', 'Orang Asli', '’ (“original people”), there are distinct differences between the various tribes. Many Orang Asli communities still practise their traditional culture – for example, continuing a nomadic lifestyle or living in shared communes. Some have been forced off their traditional lands by land clearances and have had to adopt a more urbanised lifestyle. The biggest indigenous group is the Iban, with a population of approximately 600,000. There are also smaller groups of Bidayuhs, Kadazan and Negritos, among many others.', 'Migrated Ethnicities', 'Malaysia has significant populations of people with foreign ancestry who mostly live in the cities. There are small populations of Indonesians, Nepalis, Filipinos and Europeans. However, the largest minority groups consist of Malaysian Chinese (generally Han-Chinese) who make up 22.6% of the Malaysian population, and Malaysian Indians (majority Tamil) who make up 6.7%. Many members of these groups are descendants of labourers that migrated to Malaysia in the late 19th and early 20th century during British colonial rule. Some now have third-or even fourth-generation roots in the country.', 'The Malaysian Chinese population generally exhibits great diligence and resilience. This can be partially attributed to a common concept in Chinese migrant communities – ‘', 'kiasu', '’, the “fear of losing”. Kiasu motivates people to achieve in everyday life as well as economically or academically. This can be something as small as endeavouring to get to the front of a crowd or determinedly queuing for great lengths to buy or see something, or it can manifest in bigger ways (for example, aiming to be the best student in a university). As a result, Malaysian Chinese generally strive industriously to achieve what they want. However, they tend not to openly exhibit aggressiveness in their approach; they generally maintain poise and courtesy since being forceful is considered inharmonious behaviour. Nonetheless, Malaysian Chinese have come to dominate roughly 70% of the Malaysian economy and are regarded as the business-savvy ethnic group of Malaysia. They make up a large proportion of the upper class. Many Malays have perceived this as a monopolisation of the corporate sector, provoking underlying tension and mistrust between the Malays and Malaysian Chinese.', 'Bumiputera Distinction', 'Ethnicities with international origins may face social barriers for being ‘', 'pendatang', '’ (newcomers). This is due to the social identifier that categorises Malaysians as either ', 'Bumiputera', ' or ', 'non-Bumiputera', '. Bumiputera literally translates as “sons of the soil” and refers to those who are considered to be the original inhabitants of the country (i.e. Malays and Orang Asli). The word does not describe an ethnic group, but rather signifies a social status of indigeneity. Bumiputera citizens’ rights are commonly prioritised in politics as well as in other public and some private sectors of society. In this way, Malay interests are commonly privileged over those of other ethnicities whilst the Orang Asli minority remains somewhat more marginalised.', 'Malaysian Chinese and Malaysian Indians can be particularly disadvantaged by this system as non-Bumiputera status can hinder their access to education, jobs, property ownership, scholarships and other opportunities. This may explain why the majority of the Malaysian migrants in Australia are Malaysian Chinese (62.1%) and only 13.2% are Malay. Nevertheless, this political stance rarely translates into day-to-day discrimination between people. Despite the difference in their ethnicities’ origins, Malaysians of all backgrounds generally feel a personal loyalty to the country.', 'Respect and Etiquette', 'As members of such a ', 'multicultural', ' society, Malaysians are generally very attentive towards how they respectfully interact with people of all backgrounds. There are cultural ', 'norms', ' and taboos that inform what people generally believe to be appropriate and inappropriate behaviour. This is related to the Malay concept of ‘', 'budi', '’ by which ', 'politeness', ' and respect are considered essential to human interaction. The word does not have a direct English equivalent, but can be generally understood to describe attributes such as one’s wisdom, virtue, etiquette and morality. In this way, one can see that Malaysian ', 'politeness', ' and etiquette have a strong ethical basis.', 'Though budi is a traditional Malay concept, the attitude has influenced the broader Malaysian social culture and is reflected in the behaviour of people from most backgrounds. In keeping with budi, one should be gracious, polite, good-natured and calm. Indeed, Malaysians are generally quite gentle, reserved and discreet. They are often modest in their attire, body language and demeanour and tend to approach daily life with a great deal of patience. This behaviour is considered ‘', 'halus', '’ (refined) and the measure of a ‘', 'budi bahasa', '’ (man of culture). Alternatively, those who are aggressive, abrasive or loud are considered uncouth or ‘', 'kasar', '’ (crass/rough). These social expectations are shifting among the younger generation as they are becoming more accustomed to the direct style of communication that occurs in the online space. Nevertheless, it remains very important to maintain a gentle and indirect demeanour in Malaysia.', 'Face and Shame', 'In Malaysian culture, to do something inappropriate brings ‘', 'malu', '’ (shame, shyness and embarrassment) upon an individual. These feelings of shame are commonly felt when an individual loses ‘', 'face', ""’. Face is the quality embedded in most Asian cultures that indicates a person's reputation, influence, dignity and honour. By complimenting people, showing them respect or doing something to increase their self-esteem, you give them face. Similarly, people can lose face and save or build face. Therefore, individuals in Malaysia usually act deliberately and with "", 'restraint', ' to protect their self-worth and peer perception. Conservative conduct is the norm, as people don’t want to stand out and/or risk losing face by doing something inappropriate.', 'Collectivism', 'Malaysia is far more collectivistic than Western societies and individuals perceive themselves to be members of groups (i.e. their family, business or ', 'ethnicity', '). These groups reflect or come to define who their members are and often demand a high degree of loyalty. For example, the group’s interests usually supersede those of the individual, even if they conflict. Furthermore, group members expect to receive preferential treatment over anyone who is not part of the group. In return for this loyalty, an individual gains a sense of belonging, protection and unity. Being a collectivist culture, feelings of shame and pride can be felt at the individual level as well as the collective level. In this way, the actions of one individual can affect the reputation of the group they belong to.', 'Social Hierarchies', 'Malaysians generally exhibit a strong acceptance of social hierarchies. People tend to feel comfortable when they are able to distinguish another person’s status relative to them. It enables them to adjust their behaviour accordingly to show the appropriate amount of respect. An individual’s level of education often establishes their status in Malaysia. English proficiency and overseas education further enhances social standing and prestige. Wealth also becomes a factor, as those who have it tend to exhibit it. For example, the vehicle people drive is usually indicative of their class status. This has increased as society has become more cosmopolitan and materialistic. Nevertheless, people are not overly ostentatious about their money.', 'Age usually becomes the overriding factor that determines the level of respect a person commands throughout society. Elders are presumed to have great wisdom and be very deserving of authority. People tend to spend a lot of time with the older generation and give them the most attention in a room. Malaysians may use honorific speech and bow slightly when talking to someone older than them.', 'Broadly, Malaysians come across as strikingly friendly and positive people. Their collective cultural focus on relationships and people means that they are exceedingly considerate in most situations. Today, the common Malaysian social attitude is based on striving for ', 'democracy', ', formal education, equal opportunities for the different races and respect of other religions. The country is unified by a strong cultural belief in the goodness of humanity.']"
myanmar-burmese,"['Loyalty', 'Companionship', 'Interdependence', 'Faith', 'Tradition', 'Patience', 'Tolerance', 'Dependability', 'Nepal is a landlocked, mountainous country located between India and Tibet. It is well known for the impressive Himalayan range and deep valleys that shape the landscape. Nepalis have a reputation for being dependable and resilient people who can withstand difficult conditions. This was recently exemplified in the stoic national response following the devastating earthquake of 2015. Nepalis often exhibit patience and calmness, and are generally not overly dramatic people. Their tolerance has enabled many different faiths and ethnicities to coexist quite harmoniously. Much of Nepal’s culture is deeply steeped in tradition and religion. However, new values and ideas are being introduced to the general population in light of a new ', 'democratic', ' political order.', 'Nepalis are generally deeply loyal to their citizenship and culture. They are very proud that their country has never been colonised, seeing this as a key distinguishing fact between them and India. The Gurkhas (Nepali soldiers) continue to be highly admired for their role in this regard1. Nepalis understand the worth and beauty of their land. The culture is enigmatic with many religious customs, rituals, festivals, processions and local secrets. Yet, people also share a sense of sadness regarding the widespread poverty and mismanagement of their country. Indeed, poverty is an undeniable social issue. This, coupled with an unstable political situation, means the primary ambition of most Nepalis is generally to secure a stable future for their family.', 'Nepal is largely underdeveloped with limited social services and public infrastructure. There are very few urban centres outside of the capital city of Kathmandu. An estimated 83% of the population live in rural areas (2011). The geographical isolation that the mountains create has generally led many villages to be secluded from outside influence, meaning many have retained quite a distinct cultural identity. Tribal and nomadic practices continue in many places. The diversity of customs and values between regions means Nepal cannot be broadly generalised. However, typically it can be observed that the more remotely situated a community is, the more visibly traditional their cultural practices will be. Meanwhile, those regions with access to better education are likely to have diverged from some aspects of traditional social customs. Kathmandu in particular is becoming very outward looking, drawing influence from across the globe. Recent cosmopolitan transformation is visible in fashion as traditional Nepali attire is now usually only worn in rural areas.', 'Social Hierarchies', 'Nepali culture is quite hierarchical and there is significant stratification between the poorest and the most powerful of society. People mostly accept these differences in social status as the natural order and defer to those who are older or who they perceive to have a high reputation. However, a person’s status and background is not always immediately evident in Nepal. For example, one may find that a fruit seller has a degree in business. As it can be difficult to assume someone’s status from their appearance, Nepalis commonly ask about one’s age, profession, education and family background to determine the correct level of respect to be shown. Westerners often find that they are deferred to a lot and treated with high regard as (relatively speaking) they are considered to be very wealthy in Nepal. Land ownership is also a common measure of status. However, one’s family reputation and status (', 'ijat', ') is generally thought to be more important than material wealth. People are not expected to be respected because of their money, but rather their virtue. There is also a preference shown towards those who are educated or speak English. This being said, many Nepalis are gradually becoming more materialistic and money focused.', 'The Nepali awareness of status is also heavily influenced by the Hindu ', 'caste system', '. Although often classified under one term, the ‘caste’ system actually represents multiple overlapping systems of stratification. The ‘', 'varna', '’ system divides society into four broad categories (varna) that are sometimes described as clusters of castes. These are the Brahmins, Kshatriyas, Vaishyas and Sudras. Each varna is considered to indicate a different level of ‘purity’ – with the Brahmins being the holiest/purest in Hinduism. Within each varna, there are more specific ‘', 'thar', '’ categories that specify the social community one is born into and are often referred to in terms of vocation/employment. They are allocated and stratified into the varna system depending on the person’s social status. For example, occupations considered ‘dirty’ – such as cleaning or handling cow leather – are situated within the lower varna class of Sudra.', 'One’s caste traditionally determined the person’s line of work, position in the social ', 'hierarchy', ' and defined ideas of self-worth. Despite it becoming illegal to discriminate on the basis of caste in 1962, the influence of this ', 'social stratification', ' has remained. Some Nepalis may socialise and marry within their caste while others may even ostracise those belonging to subordinate castes. For example, they may not accept offers of food from someone of a low caste, believing it to be ‘impure’. Nevertheless, as Nepal modernises, the social constraints of the ', 'caste system', ' are fading. In Kathmandu, for instance, where castes mix on a daily basis, the concern regarding others’ castes is diminishing. The younger generation is also particularly liberal and open towards all castes. One of the main agendas of the incoming government has been to recognise all castes.', 'Ethnic Demographic', 'People’s social distinction, be it their caste or ', 'ethnicity', ', plays a big role in informing their personal identity in Nepal. For example, many Nepalis use the name of their ethnic group or caste as their surname. An individual’s ', 'ethnicity', ' is different from their caste. While one’s caste is usually indicative of occupation and family status, ethnic groups commonly share a distinctive language, ancestral home, religious tradition or form of social organisation.', 'The government has identified between 50 and 60 Nepali ethnicities (2011). Many of these are indigenous to Nepal and have origins as the original inhabitants of a certain region (e.g. the Tharu and Tamang people). Other ethnicities in Nepal, while not native, are often historical inhabitants of the areas. Some of the biggest ethnicities are the Brahmin-Chhetri, Magars and Newars.', 'The ethnic makeup of Nepal reflects the historical migratory patterns into the country from the North and South. Broadly, the castes and ethnicities can be broken down into two main groups: Tibeto-Burmans and Indo-Aryans. This differentiation between the two is not so much socially distinctive, but often visible in hereditary features that suggest distant ancestry. Indo-Aryans typically have similar appearances to their Indian neighbours in the South, whilst Tibeto-Burmans generally resemble Mongol or Tibetan people. Indo-Aryans are more populous and have come to dominate Nepal socially, politically and economically, while Tibeto-Burmans traditionally inhabit the mountains at very high altitudes. However, with increasing urban and overseas migration, the geographic differentiation between ethnicities is reducing.', ""Nepalis with foreign ancestry may have retained certain cultural influences that relate to their ancestral background. For example, those from India commonly follow Hinduism, whilst Tibeto-Burmans are generally Buddhist. However, these labels purely serve as a helpful way to categorise the origins of Nepal's ethnic diversity and don’t necessarily reflect Nepali people’s personal identity. People are unlikely to describe themselves as ‘Tibeto-Burman’ or ‘Indo-Aryan’. Every individual "", 'ethnicity', ' has developed a strong and distinctive cultural identity. They often share a common language, belief or form of social organisation unique to their ethnic group.', 'Collectivism', 'Nepali culture is very collectivistic. Families may combine their assets in order for all members to be economically secure, and close friends perform favours for one another on a regular basis. This ', 'interdependence', ' has been largely driven by necessity, as the government cannot always be relied upon to provide support. Instead, Nepalis tend to be deeply reliant on and loyal to their family and social group. It’s common for people to forfeit their own aspirations for the betterment of their entire family unit. For example, one person may work in very difficult conditions whilst sending remittances back to others. In rural areas and at high altitudes especially, people depend on their community for survival, and basic assets are shared communally. Village elders are often the authority figures of these communities. Those who are urban, educated and internationally exposed may be more individualistic in their outlook. However, given the underdeveloped status of Nepal, economic independence is still difficult to attain.', 'Friendship and Company', 'Most friendships have a strong significance and substance to people in Nepal. They are approached quite earnestly and are not usually shallow relationships that come and go quickly. There is a sense of graciousness that comes with sharing in another’s company; people are constantly “humbled” to meet others, have a guest or gain a new friend. Once the growth of a friendship begins, so too does an expectation of loyalty and reliability. People often reach out to friends for personal favours and support and may expect to be granted certain privileges (such as job opportunities) on the basis of the relationship.', 'Generally, Nepalis feel most comfortable when they are accompanied in whatever they do. They love companionship and are known to strike up conversation for little reason other than to talk. This aspect of Nepali culture makes it feel very warm and inclusive. People rarely go anywhere alone (', 'eklai', '), particularly women. Those who are travelling alone can expect to be questioned out of curiosity as to why; solo travellers are usually sent off with a blessing and so are accompanied by the wishes and prayers of their family.', 'Purity and Fatalism', 'A deep moral and ethical awareness is interlaced into daily life in Nepal. This is influenced by religious values and beliefs, as well as cultural ideas of purity. They are deeply entrenched and ritualised in people’s diet and personal practice. Almost any action, object, job or person can be categorised as particularly ‘pure’ or ‘impure’. Nepalis can be quite reserved in their behaviour, acting modestly in accord with what is considered to be appropriate behaviour within these cultural guidelines.', 'The fundamental importance religion holds in many Nepalis’ lives also influences their approach to problem solving. It is common for people to take a fatalistic attitude, assuming the cause of problems to be the result of a god or spirit’s work. For example, witches are sometimes thought to be the cause of bad luck. This ', 'fatalism', ' does not necessarily mean people are passive, waiting for things to occur at the will of a god. Nepalis generally work very hard until the point that they can do no more – from there, “what will be will be”. However, misfortunes are often attributed to an individual’s behaviour; for instance, bad health is commonly perceived to result from bad karma. Therefore, Nepalis are known to be quite stoic and tolerant in difficult situations as this explanation of problems can make them feel as if they somewhat deserve to suffer.', '_____________________', '1\xa0The Nepali military played a famous role in fighting the British off.2\xa0See the statistics on the side of this page for a list of different ethnic groups in Nepal.']"

The national identity of Pakistan is heavily influenced by its recent modern history. It only became a nation in 1947 when it gained independence from British rule and separated from India (known as Partition). The formation of the country bore with it an idea of what Pakistani society should look like and embody, enticing millions of people to immigrate from India. Since then, there have been constant negotiations of space and identity, leading to changes such as the secession of East Pakistan as Bangladesh.', 'Even with its sovereign borders now relatively concrete, significant upheavals have continued to occur in Pakistan. Its geographical position has subjected the country to the consequences of surrounding conflicts, and the political climate has been known to shift depending on changes in direct power.

Contemporary world events have also exacerbated differences between some of the diverse lifestyles and cultures that have previously co-existed harmoniously. In turn, Pakistan has become troubled by inter-religious tensions, ethnic conflicts and terrorism.', 'As a result, Pakistan has an ever-evolving culture and its people have had to be flexible; the past century has been unstable and involved constant compromise on their behalf. Today, the country also has an exceedingly young age structure that may present difficulties in the future. According to the CIA World Factbook, as of 2016, it is estimated 53.3% of the population is under 25. Drastic demographic shifts and turbulent politics have meant that the social security afforded to the average Pakistani citizen is minimal. Instead, adaptability, resilience and self-reliance have become important qualities.', 'Interdependence and Wasta', 'Pakistan has a collectivist culture in the sense that people are deeply interdependent and loyal to those who are in their inner circle. Social connections are essential to daily life, as citizens have often had to rely on themselves instead of their government for support and opportunities. Relationships play an important role in completing professional, personal and social tasks. This is understood through the concept of ‘', 'wasta', '’ – relationship forming. Wasta can be observed when, for example, people turn to a close friend or relative for help, instead of a government institution. This kind of social support network is crucial and gives many Pakistanis a very strong sense of community.', 'One sees the strength of this support network most visibly within families. The loyalty shown to these relationships is often extremely strong. For instance, individuals may place their family’s interests over their own, even if they conflict. Furthermore, relatives often expect to receive preferential treatment. In return for this loyalty, an individual gains a sense of belonging, protection and unity.', 'People tend to identify with their family before any other social indicator. Following that, those who are very urbanised generally tend to consider themselves predominantly ‘Pakistani’.

Pakistanis of other ethnicities can also hold resentment regarding the prevalence of Punjabis in government and positions of power.', 'Punjab has been subject to numerous invasions and migrations of people from many different cultures, including the Greeks, Arabs, Persians, Mongols and the British. This has influenced the general Punjabi culture to be open and adaptable to external influence. Punjabis themselves are generally recognised as being flexible people, quite vibrant and unreserved. Punjabi culture has also been greatly influenced by Sufism. This is most apparent through the many shrines, literature and festivals in their honour throughout the province.', 'The north and South of Punjab are quite distinct from each other.

The Sindhi language and culture is characterised by folkloric traditions predominant in rural towns. In Sindh, folk singers and women play a vital role in spreading folklore through musical instruments even older than the South Asian sitaar. The preservation of these tales and instruments is of vital importance to Sindhis, and many have been featured in modern musical renditions.

Balochistan is the biggest province of Pakistan but also the most remote and least densely populated. It is characterised by vast areas of desert-like mountainous terrain. This geographical isolation has generally led to the Balochis being secluded from outside influence, meaning they have retained quite a distinct cultural identity.', 'Minority Rights Group International has reported that the socioeconomic conditions of the Balochistan province are “abysmal” in comparison to the rest of Pakistan, with over 50% of Balochis living below the poverty line. Due to the difficulties in finding a consistent source of water and food, many Balochis survive as nomads travelling throughout the province.

Customs and traditions align with tribal law."", 'Honour (Izzat)', 'Among the rich ethno-linguistic diversity of the country, there are overarching values common to all Pakistanis. For example, much behaviour is noticeably influenced by people’s perceptions of pride, honour and shame. The concept of honour (known as ‘', 'izzat', '’ in Hindi-Urdu) is deeply embedded in Pakistani culture. A person’s honour, or izzat, is affected by their personal actions as well as the behaviour of those they are associated with (i.e. their family, community or any ', 'group', ' they belong to). Therefore, if an individual does something dishonourable, their origins (i.e. family, region or ', 'ethnicity', ') may be implicated as the cause. In this way, there is a cultural pressure for individuals to protect their personal reputation and the image of those around them. This may require people to give a public impression of dignity and integrity by stressing their positive qualities, emphasising their family member’s achievements and adhering to social expectations.', 'Doing something embarrassing, socially inappropriate or indecent can bring serious shame (‘', 'sharam', '’) upon a person. Perceptions of dishonour, and the social ostracising that can follow, is known to have very real effects on people’s future opportunities and circumstances. To prevent such indignity in Pakistan, criticism is rarely given directly and praise is often generously offered. If faced with criticism, Pakistanis are likely to deny any fault in order to avoid dishonour. It is common for people to deflect blame to someone/thing else entirely in order to protect their honour. Generally, people will only openly concede to error and take accountability when the other person is older than them, doing so out of respect.', 'It is worth noting that the expectations regarding what is ‘honourable’ and ‘shameful’ can vary significantly between different ethnicities, family backgrounds and social attitudes. For example, the younger Pakistani generation generally do not feel the need to stringently apply the honour code and will often hide certain ‘shameful’ actions they consider reasonable from the older generations who might be deeply offended by such behaviours. In this way, it can be seen that some people may not be personally ashamed of what they are doing, but more concerned that shame from society will affect their personal self-worth. This is often the case for younger Pakistanis acculturating to Australia who adopt aspects of Australian culture that their parents and parent’s friends may strongly disapprove of.']"

The population in the northern islands generally identify as Christian while it is much more common to find those who identify as Muslim in the southern parts of the Philippines.', 'The country is also linguistically diverse, with eight major dialects and over 170 languages spoken throughout the inhabited islands. The official language of the Philippines is Filipino, which is mainly Tagalog (the dialect from central and southern Luzon) combined with words from various other languages. For example, English is widely spoken throughout the Philippines, and it is common to hear Filipinos use a mixture of English and Tagalog (known informally as ‘Taglish’) in everyday conversations. Depending on their location, Filipinos may not speak the national language.

English was introduced as a result of the British colonial rule and has become the language used in government administration and commercial activities. However, the Sinhala language is still prevalent in these sectors of society. Language is a contentious issue in Sri Lanka, in part due to the ‘Sinhala Only’ initiatives supported by some politicians.

The ‘Sinhalese Only’ movement emerged as a way to define the national identity of Sri Lanka. This marginalised non-Sinhala and non-Buddhists and limited their access to state-controlled opportunities and benefits. Resistance against Sinhala nationalism by a small group known as the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) resulted in the civil conflict. The conflict created widespread displacement and resulted in up to 100,000 deaths. Moreover, as many people fear publicly discussing the civil conflict, expressions of concern and mourning have been somewhat limited to the private sphere. This has meant that, for many Sri Lankan families and households, the civil conflict continues to evoke unreconciled grief and sorrow.', 'The Sri Lankan government declared victory over the 26-year-long civil conflict in 2009, but relations between the Sinhalese and Tamils in the political and social arenas may sometimes be tense.

This refers to both physical purity, in terms of one’s body and occupation, as well as one’s spiritual purity.', 'While Sri Lankans tend to be acutely aware of the social status they hold in relation to their peers, this attitude is more common outside of urban areas, particularly in villages.

The region is marked by a diversity of landscapes, from the buzzing capital of Taipei, coastal cities of Kaohsiung and Tainan, and the mountainous countryside. Many Taiwanese consider themselves politically distinct from the People’s Republic of China (mainland China). The difference between the region’s favoured name and its official name reflects the local and international tensions regarding whether there is such a thing as a legitimate ‘Taiwanese identity’ and what form it takes.', 'While the Taiwanese people experience complexities in defining their character, they remain renowned for their friendliness and hospitality. The culture, though significantly influenced by ongoing politics, continues to reflect its peoples’ heritage, history and environment.

For example, it experienced Japanese occupation from 1895 to 1945 and developed a strong relationship with the USA in the 20th century.', 'Contestations with China', 'Taiwan’s national identity continues to be influenced by an ongoing process of resistance and negotiation on local and national levels. The tensions between Taiwan and China generally stem from disputes over China’s ‘One-China Policy’, whereby Taiwan is argued to be a part of ‘one China’. The growing number of mainland Chinese tourists visiting Taiwan further strains the relationship. This is generally due to the vast collection of ancient Chinese artefacts on display in the National Museum in Taipei, a majority of which were evacuated from mainland China by the Chinese Nationalist Party during the takeover by the Communist regime in 1949.', 'The Taiwanese population generally shares the perception that Taiwan economically depends on China. However, opinions tend to differ regarding whether Taiwan’s cultural, ethnic and political identity is distinct from that of mainland China. This somewhat reflects a generational divide within Taiwanese society, with the older generation being more likely to perceive Taiwan as a part of China than the younger generation. Many from the younger generation often feel frustrated and angry that Taiwan may be subsumed by the rhetoric of ‘one-China’. They tend to assert themselves as culturally and behaviourally distinct from the Chinese stereotype and insist upon being defined as ‘Taiwanese’.', 'Those who are inclined to identify themselves as ‘Taiwanese’ are often accused of ignoring their cultural heritage, while those who choose to associate their identity with China are faulted as being unloyal to Taiwan. Often, options of identity are polarised to be either ‘Taiwanese’ or ‘Chinese’, with corresponding opinions regarding the region’s future as either independence from or unification with China. Nonetheless, Taiwanese feel some sense of ', 'kinship', ' with their Chinese heritage and, when there is talk of ', '‘Tai Du’', ' (‘Taiwanese Independence’), it is often with respect to political disassociation rather than ancestry.', 'Interactions and Interdependence', 'The Taiwanese generally put great emphasis on their commitment to others – be that within their family, in extended relationships or in a business setting.

This leads many individuals to place the interests of others before their own, even if they conflict. Social interactions are also hierarchical, with everyone having a specific place and function within their family, workplace and society. The position of someone is often neither questioned nor subject to further justification. However, the ', 'hierarchy', ' is usually influenced by the underlying Confucian value of filial ', 'piety', '. This requires individuals to show respect and duty towards their parents and elders, and translates into a respect for age in general.', 'The notion of face (', 'mien-tzu', ') also plays an integral role in the relationships and interactions between people. Face is essentially the reputation and dignity of a company, family or individual. It is possible to lose or save one’s face, as well as give another person face. Therefore, in cultures that have an awareness of face, individuals usually act deliberately and with ', 'restraint', ' to protect their self-worth and peer perception. Conservative conduct is the norm, as people don’t want to stand out and/or risk losing face by doing something inappropriate.

Many see this as a result of the West’s influence (namely America) on society. The cultural change is particularly evident when comparing the youth and elders of society as the social attitudes between the age groups have evolved in different ways.', 'Generally, younger generations experience a greater degree of privacy and freedom of choice on personal matters (such as education and marriage) but are still expected to consult and accommodate the opinions of their family. This contrasts from the experience of older generations, who grew up in a culture in which parents were the arbiters of life choices. This difference in opinion about expectations and decision-making can cause tensions among families and in wider society. The younger generation is also often more familiar with English and liberal in their political opinions.', 'Nevertheless, traditional and cultural attitudes have not been totally cast aside by the youth. Traditional values continue to be influential. For example, in accordance with filial ', 'piety', ', there remains a general cultural consensus that one should be respectful of their parents and elders and obliging of their wishes. Moreover, both generations also tend to perceive materialistic behaviours as wasteful or selfish.', 'Geographical Distinctions', 'Taiwan recently underwent a rapid transformation with its traditional agriculturally based economy shifting towards manufacturing basic goods.

In nearly all cases, how one sits, walks or otherwise interacts with others will depend upon the status of each person present. Therefore, it is not uncommon for Thais to ask personal questions to discern your status to ensure they address you correctly and behave appropriately.

The country’s history of evading ', 'colonisation', ' by European nation states has also contributed to the sense of pride and value in freedom and autonomy. However, despite the cultural value placed on freedom of expression, laws limit the extent to which Thais can criticise or insult the two fundamental institutions of their society: the royal family and Buddhism.

The government's establishment of a ‘Thai identity’ in the late 1950s was part of a national rhetoric to affirm a unified ‘Thai culture’ associated with the ‘Central Tai’ – the dominant ethnic group in Thailand. This concept of a Thai identity was used in part to challenge the Chinese "", 'ethnicity', ' within the country. Ethnic Chinese have long played a significant role in Thailand’s business and commerce sectors.

Sometimes known as the ‘heart of the Thai people’, Abulyadej is given the utmost respect as many saw him as a national symbol of Thai identity and unity. Images of the recent monarch pervade the daily life of Thais, frequently appearing in public as well as in people’s homes as a constant reminder of a unified ‘Thai identity’. This is also evident in Australia, with many Thai restaurants showcasing a portrait of the recent king.', 'Showing disrespect for the king and the royal family is illegal and a social taboo. Citizens are restricted from exhibiting behaviour that could be interpreted as defamatory or critical of the royal family.

Though few people speak Portuguese as their native language, Portuguese is still used in legal, government and education settings.41 Meanwhile, Indonesian and English are working languages, with the latter used mainly in business settings and by foreign agencies.42', 'East Timorese are often multilingual. However, knowledge of certain languages can differ depending on the generation due to changing sociolinguistic conditions and language policies throughout the country’s political history.43 For those who grew up in the 1960s and early 1970s, Portuguese was used in official, educational and religious settings.44 Portuguese was subsequently banned during the Indonesian occupation (1975-1999), and Bahasa Indonesian became the official language used in schools. Meanwhile, the local language of Tetum continued to be the primary language used by the Catholic Church, which facilitated the popularity and spread of Tetum throughout the country.45 Once independence was achieved, Portuguese became an official language again, alongside Tetum.', 'Generational Experiences', 'The constant political changes of Timor-Leste within a short period of time have led to some differences of experiences among the generations. Studies suggest that nearly all East Timorese were affected by displacement and resettlement at some point.46 For example, those who lived under Indonesia’s occupation of Timor-Leste experienced constant movement between roadside villages and nearby forests or mountains during outbursts of conflicts.47 In some cases, many fled their original homes, taking refuge in mountains for prolonged periods of time and emerging only after the end of the occupation.48', 'Political independence created an opportunity for many families and communities to return and reclaim their ancestral and inherited lands, and restore their ‘sacred house’ (see ', 'Local and Indigenous Worldviews', ' in ', 'Religion', '\xa0for more information). So far, it is mostly older members of the community who have chosen to return.49 However, this opportunity has presented a difficult decision for those in younger generations who need to consider the cost of starting afresh and moving further away from educational and health care services.50 Others may have to navigate an added complex set of social relations – such as whether they will be welcomed or if exogamous marriage customs will be challenged (see ', 'Dating and Marriage', ' in ', 'Family', ').51', 'At times, the differences in generational experiences have led to social tensions. The older generation raised during Portuguese rule dominated and directed much of the country’s development in the independence period. The following generation, who were raised under Indonesia’s occupation, have thus at times felt alienated from the process of nation-building, and that their contributions to resistance as youth and students have been overlooked.52 Such dynamics are also undergoing changes with the emergence of the younger post-independence generation.', 'National Identity, Struggle (Funu) and Suffering (Terus)', 'The major historical transitions of Timor-Leste have played an important role in shaping the country’s current national identity and forging a sense of unity across people of various ethnic and linguistic backgrounds. A common national identity has emerged through the collective experiences of struggle (', 'funu', ') and suffering (', 'terus', ') during the country’s ', 'colonisation', ', occupation and independence.53 Further, the use of the local language Tetum and the longstanding prevalence and popularity of Catholicism have been more permanent national symbols that citizens have been able to identify with regardless of political governance. Visual representations are often used to express the East Timorese national identity (such as various national flags), in part due to persistently low literacy levels (see ', 'Education and Literacy', ').54', 'Though nation-building and national identity formation have brought about consensus and a common identity, such processes have at times led to frictions within East Timorese society.55 Most notable is the intense period of civil disorder, inter-communal violence and property destruction that occurred during 2006 in the capital of Dili – 38 people were killed and over 100,000 people were displaced.56 The country also continues the process of consolidating its territorial boundaries with neighbouring nations.57', 'The national identity that emerged in the wake of independence continues to be reshaped and debated in this new post-independence period. While the dual concepts of struggle (', 'funu', ') and suffering (', 'terus', ') reflect the collective experiences of the past, these concepts continue to be applied to the contemporary East Timorese experience. For example, they have helped frame some of the current obstacles, such as ongoing socioeconomic challenges.58', 'Education, Literacy and Social Stratification', 'Constant changes to the socio-political conditions throughout the mid-20th century and early 21st century have impacted access to education. When Timor-Leste was a colony of Portugal, the Catholic Church played a vital role in the delivery of education and health care during the colonial period.59 However, by 2001, approximately 90% of schools were destroyed.60 These schools were responsible for the employment of roughly 6,000 teachers and education of 240,000 children.61', 'The rebuilding process quickly progressed, with the number of teachers doubling in the period between 2002 and 2014, and student enrolments rising to 364,000.62 Nonetheless, education and literacy rates continue to be an ongoing challenge. More than half of all women 45 years or older and more than half of all men 55 years or older are illiterate.63 Illiteracy also affects a portion of the youth, with 14.4% of males and 14.0% of females between the ages of 15 to 19 being illiterate.64', 'Education and literacy tends to be a key factor in terms of socioeconomic status. The adult literacy rate is approximately 87.8% in urban areas, but is just slightly above half (53.7%) in rural areas.65 Many of those residing in rural parts of the country are subsistence farmers who use agriculture to maintain their family but otherwise live outside the cash economy.66 Of the entire population over the age of 10 who are employed, 64.2% are self-employed farmers.67 The next most common form of employment is the government, which makes up 13.5% of the working population.68 Though the oil and gas industry accounts for up to 90% of the country’s gross domestic product, few people are employed in the sector.69 Moreover, youth unemployment continues to be an ongoing struggle, with 74% of the population under 35 unemployed.70', 'Education and socioeconomic position have been some of the push factors contributing to migration. For instance, since all East Timorese born before 2002 are entitled to Portuguese citizenship, many in the economic position to do so have moved to Portugal for study and employment.71 There are also East Timorese communities found in Indonesia, the Philippines and the United Kingdom.72 Some have also migrated to Australia under the Family Migration Scheme (see ', 'East Timorese in Australia', '). Those who move abroad tend to send remittances back to their families in Timor-Leste as a way to provide support.73', 'Collectivism and Harmony', 'Many East Timorese place a high value on ', 'harmony', ' and unity with others, maintaining a strong connection with their community and relatives. People are often deeply involved with the collective life of their entire community in Timor-Leste, with social events usually incorporating the entire neighbourhood or village. A unified and interdependent community (or extended family network) provides a support system that an individual can rely on daily. For example, it is common for an East Timorese to be able to depend on their social connections for assistance in virtually any activity, such as preparing for a major lifecycle event (e.g. birthdays, weddings or funerals), building a home, or completing agricultural activities. These systems are often seen as necessary due to economic hardship or the unreliability or inaccessibility of official services.', 'In collectivist cultures such as Timor-Leste, people tend to feel a strong sense of responsibility to those around them. Cooperation and collective achievement is often emphasised over self-fulfilment and personal gain in order to maintain social ', 'harmony', '. Similarly, East Timorese are expected to uphold their duties, responsibilities and obligations to one another (such as caring for parents into old age). People tend to be conscious of how their behaviour or failure to uphold social expectations may reflect on their family or community; many value the collective reputation, dignity and honour of the group. Generally speaking, reserved conduct is the norm in Timor-Leste as people wish to maintain ', 'harmony', ' between each other. For example, East Timorese tend to speak indirectly to avoid conflict.', 'Adaptability and Resilience', 'Personal and collective experiences of adversity have influenced many East Timorese to be adaptable and resilient. Indeed, adaptability has been a hallmark of East Timorese culture. Many take pride in the fact that elements of Timor-Leste’s traditional culture were able to adapt and survive in spite of political and social circumstances. For example, though many were displaced and resettled, communities were able to maintain social institutions of customary authority.74 Traditional arts have also survived and are now being celebrated and shared.

east-timorese,"['Harmony', 'Humility', 'Face', 'Resilience', 'Filial piety', 'Perseverance', 'Stoicism', 'Modesty', 'Vietnam is one of the most populous countries in Southeast Asia and deeply multifaceted. Its culture reflects a mixture of local traditions that have come to incorporate the advances of globalisation. These two aspects of modern-day Vietnam often coincide in curious ways; today, a farmer making traditional offerings to the spirits of his ancestors may burn pictures of mobile phones and other technological devices that are perceived as valuable to those deceased. Vietnamese contemporary ideologies have also been significantly shaped by the foreign influences of both neighbouring and Western countries. Despite the many prolonged cultural invasions by other countries, the Vietnamese sense of national identity has survived and still engenders a strong patriotism and affiliation from many people. Today, the Vietnamese spirit is independent, opportunistic and resilient.', 'Political Difficulties', 'Vietnam has endured a huge amount of difficulty and suffering in its recent past. Its people are generally very conscious of this history and take the legacy of past events very seriously. Many are still impacted by the physical, emotional and economic effects of the American War (known to the West as the ‘Vietnam War’). The culture does not have a naturally happy-go-lucky feeling to it, as there remains a collective lamenting felt throughout the society. Yet, to their credit, the Vietnamese people rarely complain and continue to be motivated and resilient despite having experienced so much adversity. They are often very stoic and realistic; problems get put into perspective as almost every family has a story of grief or loss relating to the war. Contemporary struggles also continue, as much of the population has to work very hard in order to make ends meet.', 'This consideration should not be misunderstood to give the general perception of Vietnam as a poor, sad and underdeveloped country. It has progressed incredibly quickly in the last few decades to have one of the fastest-growing market-based economies in Asia. Furthermore, the current population of Vietnam is exceedingly young. Roughly 24% of all Vietnamese are 15 years old or younger while over 50% of the population is under 30 years of age. This means that two out of three Vietnamese were actually born after the war and are somewhat unacquainted with the devastation the older generations suffered. The war should continue to be acknowledged as it continues to play a key role in many Vietnamese people’s identity. However, avoid characterising all Vietnamese as products of the conflict.', 'Today, Vietnam is governed as a communist state through a one-party system. Many Vietnamese support ', 'democracy', ' and feel disenfranchised by this government. This is particularly true of those from Southern Vietnam, which was heavily influenced by Western ideals of ', 'individualism', ' and liberalism. On the other hand, the North of Vietnam is generally considered more conservative, traditionally minded and complicit with the communist regime. Some Southern Vietnamese continue to resent those of the North due to events occurring in the war. They may renounce the communist flag and show allegiance to the flag of South Vietnam (a yellow flag with three red stripes). This is flown on commemoration days and on the day they call the “fall of Saigon”. They may also continue to refer to Ho Chi Minh City by its original name of “Saigon”. However, the current government imposes limits on freedom of speech and does not tolerate disrespectful or critical comments about Ho Chi Minh. It also officially rejects the Southern Vietnamese flag and there can be serious implications if one is found in possession of it.', 'It is important to understand that this dichotomy between the North and South, regarding the perceptions of historic events and the current Communist Party, can be a very sensitive subject for Vietnamese. While most Vietnamese in Australia are from Southern Vietnam, people’s opinions may vary depending on their region of birth, age, education and personal experiences.', 'Underpinning Interaction', 'There are a few shared cultural ', 'norms', ' that deeply influence behaviour and communication across the general population of Vietnam. The first is the concept of ', 'face', "". This is the quality embedded in most Asian cultures that indicates a person's reputation, influence, dignity and honour. By complimenting people, showing them respect or doing something to increase their self-esteem, you give them "", 'face', '. Similarly, people can lose ', 'face', ' by being criticised or behaving in a way that is considered socially inappropriate. Therefore, individuals generally act deliberately in Vietnam to protect their self-worth and peer perception. People speak quite indirectly and politely as one’s speech is assumed to reflect their virtue.', 'Many Vietnamese may also have a fatalistic attitude and take a more reactive approach to problems as opposed to proactive action. This is influenced by the Buddhist belief that what one did in their previous life determines what they experience in their current life – “to the same degree, they reap today what they have sown in the past”. This view can make some Vietnamese quite receptive and resigned to difficult situations, as they may believe the circumstances are the result of a predetermined destiny.', 'The value of ', '‘khiêm’ ', '(modesty) or ', '‘khiêm tốn’ ', '(modesty and self-', 'restraint', ') is also central to Vietnamese life. Vietnamese people often show a great deal of humility by self-humbling and downplaying emotion and communicating indirectly. This disposition is thought to maintain more ', 'harmony', '. However, while the Vietnamese may speak quite modestly, they are also observed as being especially honest.', 'Social Hierarchies', 'The Vietnamese do not like to stratify their people into ‘classes’ and prefer to feel unified in their society. The government’s communist orientation particularly supports this view. Nevertheless, in reality, there are quite distinguished stratifications in society. Many people were left impoverished as a result of the American War and the policies of the Communist Party’s governmental regimes. The differences in wealth between those living in rural and urban areas are becoming bigger. As such, there is not much of a recognised middle class; people are mostly distinguished as either ‘rich’ or ‘poor’. Brand items are admired and those who are wealthy tend to exhibit their affluence to differentiate themselves. The term ‘nha que’ (peasant or country person) carries derogatory connotations. As of a 2014 estimate, roughly 67% of Vietnamese live in rural areas while 33% live in urban areas. There is a visible differentiation in cultural values between the two lifestyles, with the urban areas now very commercially oriented and motivated.', 'There is a general cultural acceptance of hierarchies in society regarding one’s age, gender, status and education (relating to Buddhist, Confucian and Taoist concepts). Education is highly valued and often the most respected above all other attainable attributes of status – approximately 94% of the population is literate. By filial ', 'piety', ', there is also a strong cultural emphasis on the importance of age. In Vietnam, age determines the grading of respect in many interactions. Often, this can mean a person has to unconditionally obey seniors or defer to the views of the older person in an argument. People should not disagree with their elders unless able to do so very respectfully.', 'China’s Influence', 'China has had a recurrent influence on Vietnam, significantly shaping the composition of the country’s traditional culture. The continual efforts by China to assimilate Vietnam have noticeably Sinicized some cultural customs (such as family systems) and ideologies (through the introduction of Confucianism and traditional Chinese philosophies). However, the Vietnamese people have generally always maintained a distinct identity and resisted being subsumed by the influences of China. It is important to understand this as comparisons between China and Vietnam often make them seem very similar. However, Vietnamese national identity and culture are determinedly different.', 'From their intense and long history of national and cultural survival, the Vietnamese have developed a strong independent streak. There is a noticeable nationalism in the culture as the retention of the Vietnamese identity has been such a long-enduring feat. Many people find this a source of pride. This can make it quite difficult for older generations of Vietnamese to acculturate to Australia, as there has been a long history of resistance to cultural change.']"

In fact, the land of contemporary Austria was once part of a more extensive empire known as the Austro-Hungarian empire (formerly part of the Habsburg Dynasty), which also covered present-day Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Croatia, Slovenia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, as well as parts of Poland, Romania and Italy.', 'While some might perceive similarities between Austria and other German-speaking countries such as Switzerland and Germany, various historical events and institutions have shaped Austria to be distinct from its Germanic counterparts, such as the Habsburg Empire, World War II and the Catholic Church. The values of cooperation, formality and gemütlichkeit (warmth or happiness) are cornerstones of contemporary Austrian culture. Austrians also have a deep respect for the environment, artistic talents and enriching conversations.', 'Regionalism and Geography', 'Austria is divided into nine ‘', 'Bundesländer', '’ (‘single lands’ or provinces). Nearly every Austrian province shares a border with another European country, apart from Vienna. In turn, the people of each province tend to have some distinctions, often noticeable in language and dialect. One of the main determining factors of the distinctiveness among regions is geography, specifically the mountains and forests. Indeed, one of the most prominent parts of Austria’s landscape is the Alps. While historically the Alps did not demarcate official provincial boundaries, due to the impassable nature of the mountainous region, many inhabitants of the Alps were isolated from the rest of the country.', ""Geographic and geopolitical elements have led to differing cultural characteristics between regions and cities within Austria, visible in the way traditional heritage, foods, architecture and celebrations vary across the country. Austrians are generally proud of their regional identities and it is quite normal for people to show loyalty to their local area. Although they hold their regional identity and distinctions dearly, Austrians also feel connected to the broader ‘Austrian' identity. Such regional distinctions have somewhat diminished since the advent of mass media and increased mobility."", 'Ethnicity and Language', 'For the most part, Austria is ethnically homogeneous with just over 90% identifying as Austrian. However, there are notable Slovene (in Carinthia), Croatian (in Burgenland), Czech, Slovak and Hungarian minorities. Austrian law guarantees the preservation of their language and culture. The country is also home to numerous immigrant, refugee and transmigrant groups that have largely arrived since the end of World War II. After 1945, labourers from southern Europe, the Balkans and North Africa moved to Austria as ‘guest workers’. Many of these workers, particularly Bosniaks and Serbs, have since made permanent homes in Austria for their families.', ""Austria's ethnic composition has changed in recent decades, and population growth in the country is mainly due to immigration. Austria has generally been welcoming towards refugees and committed to family reunification on a national level. Indeed, the country has among the highest number of asylum seekers per capita compared to other European countries. Many recent migrants and refugees come from the Middle East and North Africa. The Austrian government makes an effort to assist newcomers through German-language courses and job training. In recent times, the government has shifted to stricter immigration restrictions as the mass influx of migrants has strained resources and altered public opinions. Indeed, the unprecedented number of newcomers has challenged Austria economically and culturally."", 'The official language of Austria is German. There is a discernible difference between the versions of German spoken in Austria and Germany. This is noticeable in the vocabulary. For example, the word ‘potato’ in Austria is ', '‘Erdapfel’,', ' while in Germany it is ', '‘Kartoffel’', '. There are also regional differences in the dialect of German spoken. For instance, a dialect known as Wienerisch is spoken in Vienna. Dialectical differences tend to be more pronounced in rural areas and Austrians from one part of the country may not understand the dialect of another due to linguistic differences. Along the border between the Carinthia province and Slovenia, it is common for people to speak Slovene. Similarly, there are Hungarian and Croatian speakers in the Burgenland province. Nearly all Austrians know at least two languages.', 'Social Structure and Egalitarianism', 'In general, Austria places great value on an egalitarian social structure. According to Hofstede Insights (2018), Austria scores very low on the ', 'Power Distance', "" dimension (score of 11), meaning that emphasis is placed on participative communication and equality among members of society. The social welfare system of Austria reflects this value of equality. Indeed, the welfare system is fairly extensive and provides support for most of the population's health, education, employment and retirement needs."", ""Another contributor to Austria's egalitarian society is the country's education system. The vast majority of Austria's population has a high literacy rate, and all children are given the right to free education along with transportation and learning resources. In recent times, the government has made it compulsory for all citizens under the age of 18 to either complete their education or undertake apprenticeship training "", '(ausbildungspficht),', ' thus ensuring children have a high standard of education to enter the workforce.', 'Many of the traditional markers of socioeconomic class affiliation have faded over the last few decades. The standard of living in Austria is quite high, and the unemployment rate is relatively low. However, classes are still prominent throughout Austria. There is a sizable middle class and a general trend for the Roma population and other immigrant groups to be less economically stable. Higher education is often seen as the means to upward mobility.', 'Past Experiences and Current Attitudes', ""The events of the World Wars have made a significant impact on Austria's culture and people. One pivotal event was the unification of Germany and Austria. Talks of a unification between the two countries began as far back as the mid-19th century. At the end of World War I, various treaties were established to prevent the political and economic union of Austria with Germany. However, the beginnings of World War II saw Nazi German troops annexing Austria in an attempt to unify Austria with Nazi Germany forcibly.\xa0This annexation is referred to as "", '‘Anschluss’.', 'The events that followed would inevitably transform the country and its people. For the next six or so years, many Austrians, particularly those who demonstrated opposing political views or religious affiliations (such as Catholics or Jews) fled the country to avoid persecution, deportation or extermination (see more in the ', 'Religion', ' section). In addition to being persecuted for political and religious views, Austrians suffered significant losses on the battlefield. During World War II, hundreds of thousands of Austrians fought under the German military. Nearly all Austrians of the time experienced displacement, loss and trauma.', 'Today, the topics of World War II and Anschluss can still evoke strong emotions, with what has been called the ""endless discussion"" of Austria\'s role during World War II as victims or accomplices in the war. For some, there is still a sense of guilt and sadness attached to the events of the war. For the most part, Austrians are open to discuss the events. In some cases, the topic may even be approached lightheartedly, particularly among younger generations.', ""At the end of World War II, Austria was divided into four zones that were governed by each of the four Allied powers (France, the former Soviet Union, the United Kingdom and the United States). Over the next decade, Austria peacefully re-established its territorial sovereignty and proclaimed itself to be in a permanent position of neutrality. To this day, Austria prides itself on its neutral stance, and the country has become a model of political, social and economic stability in the region. Owing to Austria's neutrality, the capital of Vienna has become an important United Nations (UN) city."", 'New approaches to interactions and politics have also emerged. Tolerance, cooperation and consensus are often the guiding principles of many Austrians in their private and public lives. The concept of ', '‘Sozialpartnerschaft’ ', '(‘social partnership’) refers to a cooperative relationship of social partners (usually companies, trade unions and political groups), where decision makers seek a consensus and resolution of conflict long before enacting legislation or making official announcements.

Both modern and traditional forms of artistry are popular. One of the longest standing artistic expressions in Austria is music from the Classical and Romantic eras. Indeed, Austria is known for its various classical composers, most notably Wolfgang Mozart. Vienna is also associated with two particular music genres: the operetta and the waltz. Austrian society and the government make efforts to instil an appreciation for the arts in younger generations. For example, Austrian children often have compulsory music and art classes, and it is common to find conservatories and private music schools throughout the country. It is not uncommon to find Austrians as members of a band, choir or informal music groups with friends and neighbours.', 'Other facets of the arts, such as writing, painting and architecture, are also well-loved throughout the country. Coffeehouses in Austria have long been meeting places for writers and poets. Today, many will gather at a coffeehouse to share their works or to read in a library section, which is commonly found in many cafes. Austria’s literary luminaries include Franz Kafka, Ludwig Wittgenstein and Karl Kraus.', 'Although popular music, television, motion pictures and other forms of popular culture are enjoyed throughout the country, the arts and artistic talent of traditional Austrian culture remain important to many generations. Large numbers of younger generations have an appreciation for artistry, as indicated by their attendance at orchestral concerts and theatrical performances. The popularity of enjoying the arts is in part due to the cheap, standing-only tickets available for everyone to purchase and special discounts available for students.', 'Appreciation for Wealth', ""A recurring theme throughout Austrian culture is a shared perception of wealth. Austrians tend to view themselves as wealthy in various ways – wealthy regarding natural landscapes and climates, culturally and artistically wealthy, and economically prosperous. This sense of appreciation for wealth manifests in various ways. For example, up until the events of World War II, Austria was economically prosperous. The events caused instability and poverty, yet Austrians endured much hardship to make the country prosperous again. Thus, there is a great sense of pride and appreciation towards Austria's current position of economic prosperity."", ""Another example is how most Austrians have a deep love of nature and take great pride in their country's landscapes. Outdoor activities and sports such as hiking, mountain climbing, sailing and swimming are prevalent. It is common to find people partaking in"", ' ‘Spaziergänge’, ', 'which refers to the act of taking a leisurely walk or stroll. Gardening is also popular, even in places where there is limited space.

Ultimately, different civilizational periods have led to a blending of Islamic traditions and Near East/Turkic cultural behaviours with Christian conventions and Western European values.', 'Daily Life', 'Bosnians are renowned for being cheerful, outgoing and engaging people. One can expect to be met with great generosity and warmth. People are quick to offer their support to both strangers and friends. This\xa0selflessness of the culture is noticeable on a day-to-day basis. For example, Bosnians commonly feel compelled to lend a hand and help others, even when the person has not requested their assistance. This can be important as a sense of pride may inhibit Bosnians (men in particular) from asking for help when they need it; the cultural generosity can save one from the embarrassment of having to ask for favours. However, it also means Bosnians can sometimes put themselves in difficult situations where they find themselves over-extending beyond their means.', 'Bosnia and Herzegovina has quite a relaxed and slow pace of life. People tend not to schedule their day extensively. Rather, they may prefer to allow events to transpire naturally, deciding to do activities impulsively as they bump into friends throughout the day. Indeed, they are known to sometimes act spontaneously for enjoyment when they are in the mood to do something. This is called ', '‘ćeif’,', ' when one is carried away by the moment.', 'Bosnians may enjoy leisurely strolls down promenades (', 'korza', '), and most like to meet and spend a long time chatting in cafés/bars (', 'kafići', '). People especially like to socialise over coffee. It’s common to meet at evening gatherings, known as ', '‘sijelo’.', ' This could involve several members of a neighbourhood going to a household and spending a long evening drinking coffee and discussing the latest news, or it could be a group of younger people going to a social event together.', 'The relaxed approach to time and emphasis on socialisation is deeply embedded in the culture, but it also can be partly attributed to the high unemployment rate. Roughly 40% of the population is without a job.1 Hence, permanent financial stability and prosperity is a primary ambition. Nevertheless, Bosnians are resourceful people. As it is often too expensive to pay for labour, most people try to fix or build things themselves with the help of friends or family. This self-reliance and do-it-yourself approach reflects the traditional agricultural lifestyles of the Balkans.', 'Geographical Distinctions', 'Regional identities continue to have a great deal of importance in Bosnia. People’s hometowns can imply a lot about them, such as their ', 'ethnicity', ', religion, politics and beliefs. Smaller towns and villages may also have distinct folk identities that differentiate them from their neighbouring provinces. A cultural divide is noticeable between those that live in urban areas and those that live in the countryside. The former tend to stereotype villagers. This has influenced the younger generation to be more inclined to move into the towns or cities. Nevertheless, more than half of the population continues to live in rural areas.', 'Bosnians are very proud of and loyal to their hometowns and regions. Even those who have moved to cities generally maintain close ties to their provincial identities. However, for many Bosnians, these identities have been fractured since the Bosnian conflict. Many were displaced or forced to leave hometowns where their family and community had lived for generations. Others have found that, since the country’s division into ', 'ethnicity', '-specific regions, their town or village now has a different ethnic majority, meaning they face social and political marginalisation or even intimidation in some cases. This has prevented some from returning to their pre-war homes as well as prompting many people to move to an area where their ', 'ethnicity', ' is more dominant. More explanation of this conflict and surrounding circumstances is provided below.', 'Community and Neighbours', 'A Bosnian’s neighbourhood (', 'komšiluk', ') is essential to their support network, especially for those whose kin live in a different village or on the other side of town. Some Bosnians may take it upon themselves to visit their close neighbours every week. Women often represent a household in this way, bringing the wishes of the entire family as they visit other wives while husbands are at work. Men tend to socialise with other men in more public places such as coffee houses. Both these activities maintain friendship and community spirit. If people visit one another frequently and then perhaps miss a visit for one reason or another, the neighbour can be led to think they have done something wrong.', 'In such tightly knit communities, everyone knows one another and one’s family background implies a lot about a person. This lack of privacy means word of a family’s business can circulate quickly. Thus, Bosnians are generally careful when seeking support to make sure their grievances don’t become the subject of community ‘gossip’ and embarrass the household name. However, the intimate neighbourhood also gives a sense of belonging and safety. Bosnian culture is quite collectivistic in this sense. This community spirit is also not exclusive to rural areas or townships. In cities, entire apartment blocks may know each other and look out for one another.', 'Generational Differences', 'There is a traditional ', 'hierarchy', ' of age in Bosnian culture. Elders are to be respected because age brings authority, experience, knowledge and wisdom. However, the social status of age is changing amongst the technological and cultural changes of the current era. Many older people have had difficulty embracing new approaches that the younger generations adopt quite fluidly. Furthermore, since the Bosnian War occurred, many traditional ', 'norms', ' and customs have either been transformed or set aside as different priorities have taken hold. Whilst elders are still shown visible respect, the post-war period has brought the young generation forward in the social scene and given them great social power. As a result, individualist attitudes have become more noticeable among the younger generations.', 'Ethnicity', 'Bosnia and Herzegovina is the most multiethnic country of the former Yugoslav nations. While most citizens are descended from Slavs, distinct identities have developed over time.\xa0Today, many\xa0individuals generally understand themselves as belonging to a specific people/nationhood (', 'narod', ')\xa0or ethno-religious group (', 'nacija', ') in addition to their national citizenship. The three main groups are Bosniaks, Bosnian Serbs and Bosnian Croats. These are considered to be the ‘constituent’ ethnicities of Bosnia, meaning they have a claim to the constitution. Meanwhile, further minority ethnicities (such as Roma Muslims and Bosnian Jews) are not constitutionally recognised and are excluded legally from the political process.', 'It can be a very controversial matter to state statistics on the different ethnic demographics. Estimates are often disputed. However, the 2013 census found that 50.11% of the population is Bosniak (also known as ‘Bosnian Muslims’), a further 30.8% is Bosnian Serb and 15.4% is Bosnian Croat. One’s ', 'ethnicity', ' generally determines their religious affiliation in Bosnia, with most Muslims being Bosniak, Orthodox Christians being Bosnian Serb and Roman Catholic Christians being Bosnian Croats (but not exclusively). Some Bosnians may feel more loyalty and affiliation to these ethnic identities than the Bosnian national identity. More recently, ', 'ethnicity', ' has become the biggest social identifier in Bosnia since the civil war.', 'While ', 'ethnicity', ' may form the basis of public administration in Bosnia, some people who have moved to Australia may not wish to reveal their ethnic background. This may be due to concerns about potential repercussions in the aftermath of ethnic persecution during the Bosnian War, or they may not want to carry the stigma attached to their ', 'ethnicity', '’s role in the conflict. Some may have taken a personal stance that seeks to eliminate ethnic divides by refusing to identify with any group. Others may also prefer not to commit themselves ethnically if they have mixed heritage. One may find that a Bosnian identifies as a “former Yugoslav” rather than a particular ', 'ethnicity', ' to avoid this question.', 'The Bosnian Conflict (1992-1995)', 'It is important to have a basic understanding of the Bosnian conflict to appreciate the circumstance and history of the Bosnian people, as well as the role ', 'ethnicity', ' now plays in society. However, some Bosnians who were young during the war (born since 1980) may have a limited understanding of the conflict themselves. This is because the older generations can be reluctant to talk about it. Furthermore, the exact causes and dynamics of the war are hotly contested. At least three competing explanations of the war continue to circulate as each ', 'ethnicity', ' seeks to portray themselves as the primary victim of the conflict, minimising and denying war crimes to suit this purpose. Therefore, it remains very difficult to talk about each ethnic group’s role in the war without offending some Bosnian citizens. However, expatriates in Australia may be less likely to hold strong nationalist views in this regard, preferring to exclude themselves from the debate to avoid the pain it can cause.', 'Generally speaking, the conflict occurred following the breakup of Yugoslavia. Ethnic nationalists made various territorial claims over Bosnian land they regarded as belonging to their people (sometimes with the support of neighbouring Serbia and Croatia). Various attempts to achieve independence from Yugoslavia and ethnic secessionist movements resulted in the Bosnian War.', 'The war was savagely fought from 1992 until 1995 through ethnic cleansing, massacres, mass rape and other crimes against humanity. Thousands were killed and at least 2 million people were displaced (around half of the population). The international community has concluded that the massacres and mass expulsion of Bosniak civilians by Bosnian Serb forces amounted to genocide. Such immense devastation has significantly minimised the heterogeneity of the country. The war crimes carried out by militant forces during the conflict have made reconciliation very difficult.', 'Current Peace and Divisions', 'In order to end the war, a peace agreement ethnically divided Bosnia into two federal entities to ensure that Bosniaks, Serbs and Croats could not gain advantage over each other. The ‘', 'Republika Srpska’', ' (Serb Republic) covers most of the northern and eastern areas. It’s essentially controlled and populated by Serbs, with 96.2% of all Bosnian Serbs living there. Meanwhile, the ‘', 'Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina', '’ covers most of the central and western areas and is dominated by Bosniaks and Bosnian Croats. The federation is further subdivided into 10 cantons allocated to Bosniaks or Croats respectively. However, most major cities are largely multiethnic.', 'This system is meant to ensure that Bosniaks, Serbs and Croats are all able to govern themselves and be equally represented. Each ', 'ethnicity', ' has its own government, parliament, police and other bodies. Bosnia even has three presidents (one Bosniak, one Serb and one Croat) that take turns in office. However, it is widely recognised that this complex configuration has maintained ethnic divides and prevented unification. This is not to say that relations are necessarily hostile, but outside of cosmopolitan cities, this system generally limits interethnic contact to business relations. There has been an effective population transfer as people have moved to regions where their ', 'ethnicity', ' is the majority.', 'There is speculation over the sustainability of the current state system, what alternative is available and whether Bosnia will even exist as one country in the future. However, most Bosnian citizens are primarily concerned with maintaining the peace. While the wounds from the heartbreaking war are still fresh, opinion polls show that the Bosnian population is not as preoccupied with ethnic differences and nationalisms as politicians suggest.', 'Most Bosnians have returned to their normal life and interactions between the ethnicities on a day-to-day basis are friendly, respectful and peaceful. Interethnic marriage is also common. Some people may still have a low level of trust for other ethnicities. However, this is generally determined by whether one has a strong loyalty to their ', 'ethnicity', '/narod over their citizenship. Generally, those who have an advanced education and higher socioeconomic status are more likely to have more friends of mixed nationality than those who are very religious or have been displaced by the war.2', '_____________________', '1 Trading Economics, 20172 O’Loughlin, 2010']"

Moreover, Croatians often take great pride in their country’s cultural heritage and maintain a strong sense of loyalty to their nation, regional identities and families.', 'Ethnic Interactions', 'A variety of ethnic groups coexist within the country, in part due to the fact that the lands that make up modern-day Croatia were once part of the former Yugoslavia.

The association between religion and ', 'ethnicity', ' influences social perceptions such that one’s ', 'ethnicity', ' is considered to indicate one’s religious affiliation. Those of Croat ', 'ethnicity', ' tend to identify as Roman Catholic while Serbs tend to identify as Eastern Orthodox. In terms of language, those who identify as Croat speak Croatian while Serbs speak Serbian. Although the languages of the former Yugoslav states are quite similar – particularly Croatian, Serbian and Bosnian – political developments since the collapse of Yugoslavia have encouraged the three ethnic groups to emphasise the differences among their languages, meaning that language is quite a political topic.', 'Interactions between Croats and Serbs are often quite tense, while the relationship between Bosnians and Croatians is generally harmonious. Croats abroad may be quite conscious of showing national pride as they fear having an unpleasant encounter with Serbs.', 'The ‘Homeland War’ (1991-1995)', 'In the post-WWII period, Croatia was a republic governed under the unified communist state of Yugoslavia, led by Josip Broz Tito. In 1991, a referendum voted overwhelmingly in favour of Croatia becoming an independent republic, thus leading to Croatia’s declaration of independence from Yugoslavia. The immediate post-independence period, tagged as the ‘Homeland War’ (also known as the ‘Croatian War of Independence’), entailed a four-year struggle against occupying armies from the former Yugoslav state of Serbia. Many families were impacted, as it was common for families to have members who were part of the battle.', 'The underpinning rationale for the Homeland War was to create a “Croatia for Croatians”. This reasserted ethnic divides, particularly with ethnic Serbs. However, tensions between Croats and Serbs had a long history before being further strained during the Homeland War. For many Croats and Serbs, there is much grief and sorrow that runs deep into the memories of many generations, thus making the process of reconciliation complex. The aftermath of the conflict entailed widespread reconstruction of the country’s economy and infrastructure. Today, it is common to find many Croatians in Croatia working multiple jobs in order to economically support themselves and their family.', 'Simultaneously, many experience a feeling of ‘Yugo-nostalgia’. This feeling reflects the nostalgia people from former Yugoslav states may feel towards their country during the pre-war days. Indeed, many Croats feel aggrieved about the difficulties that arose since Croatia gained independence, which was not present during the unification of Yugoslavia. Such difficulties include less social security, problems with healthcare, struggles to attain a work-life balance, poor job prospects and the overt involvement of the Catholic Church in the political sphere. This sense of nostalgia also reflects the resurgence in interest in the arts, music, culture and lifestyle of Croats before the war.', 'There is a generational divide when it comes to experiences and feelings towards the Homeland War. Those who were mature during the war find it difficult to speak about Serbia. When discussions about the tensions between Serbia and Croatia do arise, it may evoke emotions of sorrow, grief and/or anger. The older generation passed on their experiences of the conflict to subsequent generations, who may speak more openly about it.', 'National and Personal Identity', 'The post-independence political atmosphere saw Croatians question and reflect upon their own personal and national traditions, history and identity. This made room for the Croatian national identity to be shaped to reflect that of the Croat ethnic majority. However, despite state efforts to construct a national state identity, not all Croatians subscribe to the ethnonational vision. Construction of identity is often influenced by regional/local identities, traditions and experiences, with many Croatians feeling strongly towards their region’s distinctive folklore, language, dialect and food. This attachment to locality, along with many years of shared experiences and memories, tends to outweigh the desire for a distinctively national Croatian identity.', ""Croatians often seek respect and recognition as a culture that is distinct from other cultures from the former Yugoslavia. Indeed, Croatians do not appreciate being referred to as 'Yugoslavian'. As the largest ethnic group, Croats tend to think of themselves as more closely linked with Austrian and Viennese culture rather than with the other cultures of the former Yugoslavia. Croatians often wish for others to acknowledge Croatia's distinctiveness from neighbouring cultures and countries. However, while Croatians want to be seen as 'European', attempts to be identified as such have been largely unsuccessful. The journey to become a part of the European Union (EU) was difficult, taking much longer than anticipated for the country to integrate into the EU. Thus, Croatians still tend to refer to greater Europe as 'those Europeans' rather than 'we Europeans'."", 'Collectivism and Loyalty', 'The Croatian proverb, ', '‘tko ce kome ako ne svoj svome’ ', '(‘who will you help if not your own’) reflects the collectivistic nature of Croatian society. Croatians are generally very loyal people and show long-term commitment to members of their family, extended family or extended relations. A common metaphor used among Croats to describe their loyalty and identity is that of a single group of people who share the same blood. Croatians are hardworking and will often use the fruits of their labour for the benefit of their family.', 'For Croatians abroad, there is a tendency to try and keep a connection with their hometown. Some migrants are from the older generation who left their rural ancestral homes due to the war or in search of economic security, while the more recent migration of Croatians abroad is driven by the search for jobs. It is common to find Croatian expatriates remaining in touch with political developments in their hometowns and their homeland more generally. They may do so through various Croatian clubs or by visiting their hometown and family when possible.', 'Folklore and Nationhood (Narod)', 'Historical memories of the nation, shared through folklore and myths, are important to many Croatians. These artistic mediums, as well as those of poetry, music and dance, play a notable role in unifying Croatians. Such artistic expressions are influenced and inspired by the life experiences of Croatians, particularly those who reside in rural areas. This is in part due to the romanticising of rural lifestyles and traditions as the ‘soul’ of the country during the post-independence period of the country. The association between folk culture and nationhood is reflected in the Croatian word ‘', 'narod', '’, which means both ‘folk’ and ‘nation’. However, the capital city of Zagreb is increasingly taking on a new role as the country’s cultural centre.

As the largest Western European nation and one of the leading economies in the region, France continues to be a powerhouse within the European continent. French ideas developed in the Enlightenment period – such as rationalism, ', 'democracy', ' and liberty – have influenced present-day Western culture. In contemporary society, the French are often formal and courteous people who value artistry and intellectualism.', 'French Identity and Diversity', 'For many, to be French generally means that one has French citizenship and exhibits the behaviours and ideals integral to French culture. For example, the ideals expressed in the national motto of\xa0', '‘Liberté, Egalité, Fraternité’', '\xa0(‘Liberty, Equality, Fraternity’) are often identified as essential to what it means to be ‘French’. For many, the values of equality and fraternity indicate that the French are a unified and undivided group. On a personal level, many people continue to revise what it means to be French, especially in light of the growth of the EU and the influx of immigrants. However, there is a prevailing attitude that France ought to be the home of the indivisible ', '‘peuple français’', ' (French people). In reflection of this, the government prohibits state authorities from collecting data regarding personal information to avoid ethnic and religious markers highlighting differences within France. This makes it complicated to discuss French society’s ethnic and religious composition.', 'Indeed, the ', 'homogeneity', ' of contemporary France is becoming a contested and contentious topic. Despite the lack of data, it is understood that French society has become increasingly diverse over recent decades. For example, it currently has one of the largest Muslim populations in Western Europe. Muslim communities (largely made up of migrants from North Africa) have contributed to cuisine, literature and the arts in France. Some have embraced the influence of other cultures, while others believe that migrants should assimilate into the dominant French culture. Nonetheless, members of French society, including migrants, continue to redefine what it means to be French.', 'Demeanour and Interactions', 'French society is quite individualistic, meaning that the interests of oneself and one’s immediate family take priority. Often, appropriate interaction depends on whether a person is within one’s social circle or not. Indeed, there are many nuanced social conventions in France. With people outside of their social circle, the French are formal and courteous. One example is in the French language, with the distinction between ‘', 'vous', '’ and ‘', 'tu', '’ (see ', 'Communication', ').', 'It is highly important to follow social conventions and exhibit an appropriate level of formality in France. The French term\xa0', '‘faux pas’ ', '(‘wrong step’) refers to an embarrassing or unsophisticated act or remark in a social situation. An example of a faux pas would be to greet an acquaintance by their first name. Sometimes, the formal and reserved nature of the French people coupled with the directness of the French language may unintentionally come across as cold or arrogant to a foreigner. However, the proper decorum generally loosens and relaxes a lot around good friends and family. A French person is likely to show warmth and friendliness once they have properly acquainted themselves with you.', 'The French Language', 'The French language is the official and main language spoken throughout France. Previously, French was the internationally accepted language of diplomacy and was widely spoken on four continents. According to the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Development, it is the second most widely learned foreign language in the world.', 'The French people feel a deep sense of pride in their language as it is often closely linked to French identity.

The French language is also seen as an important factor in retaining a unique French identity in light of globalisation and the import of American culture. Indeed, the rise of the English language brought sadness and frustration to the French as it marked the decline of the influence of France throughout the world.', 'The language usually proves to be a difficult barrier for those visiting the country, as most French prefer engaging in their local language. French is quite a precise and structured language. At times, its direct translation into English can incidentally come across as arrogant and blunt to those unfamiliar with the language. Most locals have some degree of English proficiency and will reciprocate efforts to communicate if one demonstrates an attempt to speak French.', 'The emphasis on the French language has meant that regional dialects and minority languages are given little recognition. Nonetheless, regional dialects continue to be important to some inhabitants of each province. Some preserve their regional language through tradition or through a voluntary and deliberate return to a specific regional dialect.', 'Economic and Geographic Distinctions', 'In France, ', 'social stratification', ' is determined by two main factors. The first class indicator is one’s economic status. People’s class in this sense is often noticeable in their taste in music, art, food and leisure activities. The dominant class is often referred to as the ‘', 'bourgeoisie', '’ and is considered to be the group that has a high amount of influence over education and businesses. Though social mobility is difficult, one avenue of moving into the upper economic classes is through education. Indeed, education is highly valued in France, with many higher-paying careers requiring a high level of education. Some do not challenge the hierarchical social structure and tend to accept differences of status within society. Meanwhile, others challenge the ', 'status quo', ' and openly criticise the ‘', 'bourgeoisie', '’. Due to societal views of socio-economic class distinctions, inquiring about one’s salary and finances is generally seen as highly inappropriate.', 'The second form of stratification is between the urban and rural population. France has had a significant rural population throughout history and the country continues to have a distinction between provincial areas and large cities like Paris. Paris has long been considered the capital and cultural centre of France. Most jobs requiring a high level of education are found in the capital, and most highways throughout the country lead to Paris. The people and culture associated with Paris refer to themselves as ‘', 'Parisien', '’. Those from Paris may refer to the people and culture from the provinces as ‘', 'Provinciaux', '’ (‘Provincial’). However, those from the provinces of France may find this term derogatory as well as failing to recognise the diversity of cultures and lifestyles in the provinces.', 'Outsiders often view French culture as synonymous with the culture found in Paris. However, the culture of provincial France differs in many ways. These cultures vary from province to province, depending on where the province is located geographically. For example, the northeast region of Grand Est shares its border with Germany and has notable German influences throughout.', 'Artistry', 'A deep appreciation and respect for the arts is common throughout France. Children are taught at a young age to appreciate artistry and be patient since quality work (such as art or cuisine) may take time to produce. This appreciation generally follows a person throughout their life. A common expectation in France is that shop owners and chefs receive the appropriate respect for their talents. For example, the world-renowned Michelin Star rating system for restaurants was developed in France.', 'Many hobbies, professions and daily activities revolve around artistry. Meals often take a considerable amount of time to prepare and, in turn, are eaten slowly as a way to acknowledge and enjoy the creation. In France, cinema and theatre attendance is still common despite the increase in home entertainment options.

french,"['Pragmatism', 'Honesty', 'Privacy', 'Critical thinking', 'Organisation', 'Pacifism', 'Germany (officially the Federal Republic of Germany) is a central western European country with the second biggest population in the region.1 It was split into ‘East Germany’ and ‘West Germany’ until 1990 when the two states reunified to form a greater continuation of West Germany (the Federal Republic of Germany). The German people have remained stoic through the massive changes of the last century, adapting to the evolving social climate of the country as needed. One can attribute much of Germany’s recent prosperity to its mastery of organisation and critical thinking (', 'kritisches Denken', '). These qualities have arguably helped the society reconcile the impacts of the World Wars and the Cold War. Germans have been distinguished as particularly pragmatic (', 'pragmatische', ') and honest (', 'ehrliche', ') people. However, generalisations of the standard German character have their limits when one takes into account the strong regional differences of the country and the different experiences individuals have had in the East compared to the West. Regional identities usually affect people’s socio-cultural understandings. However, most Germans have strong moral sensitivity based on lessons of the past that have taught them to understand and respect these differences.', 'Language', 'The official language of Germany is ‘', 'Deutsch', '’ (German). Most Germans are taught ‘', 'Standarddeutsch', '’ (standard German) in school, also known as ‘', 'Hochdeutsch', '’ (high German). However, there are varying regional accents and dialects across the country. For example, those in many areas of northern Germany speak a West Germanic variation known as ‘', 'Plattdütsch', '’ (low German). The pronunciation and features of this dialect have similarities with the language spoken in the Netherlands. Meanwhile, the Germanic dialect of the southern border, ', '‘Bayrisch’', ' (Bavarian), is similar to the Austrian Germanic dialect. Despite some differences in phrases and meanings, Germans from all regions can usually understand one another.', 'Regional Diversity and Local Patriotism', 'A foreigner’s visualisation of the ‘typical German’ often conjures images of beer, lederhosen, Oktoberfest and bratwurst. However, these are actually cultural emblems particular to one state (or principality) in the south of the country (Bavaria). Such cultural characteristics differ between regions and cities within Germany, visible in the way traditional heritage, foods, architecture and celebrations vary across the country. Germans may also talk of social distinctions based on stereotyped personality traits attached to each region. For example, Germans often describe people from the southwest as ', 'stingy', '. Meanwhile, Rhinelanders in the west are generally thought to have a more laid back attitude.', 'Accents, social attitudes, religious affiliations, traditions and practices also vary between those living in the cities and those living in rural areas. For example, some of Germany’s metropolises are renowned for their alternative lifestyles and tolerant social attitudes. They tend to attract more unconventional Germans, as well as migrants. Meanwhile, rural townships generally receive less internal migration and follow more conventional lifestyles in accord with their tradition. The capital of Berlin is particularly noticeable for being a cultural outlier within the country. This unique hub differs significantly from the areas surrounding it.', 'Germans are generally very proud of their regional identities. It is quite normal for people to show more patriotism and loyalty to their local area than their nation. Each of the cities and states of Germany have their own emblems. There are over 50 coats of arms for urban and rural districts within the state of North Rhine-Westphalia alone. It is often more common to see regional flags and coats of arms in public than the national flag.', 'Social Distinctions Between the East and West', 'Some of the most pronounced social distinctions are noticeable between the western two-thirds of Germany, and the other eastern third. From the end of World War II until 1990, the nation was divided as two separate countries under different systems of rule. West Germany was administrated under a capitalist system as the ', 'Federal Republic of Germany (FRG/BRD)', ', whilst East Germany was occupied under Soviet Communist rule as the ', 'German Democratic Republic (GDR/DDR)', '. West Germany became more cosmopolitan and industrialised, aligned with Western Europe and North America. Meanwhile, East Germany was ruled under a strict socialist ideology.', 'The two states reunified in 1990 to create a larger version of West Germany (FRG). As modern-day Germany has been unified for less than 30 years, the dividing line of the inner German border that once separated the East from the West is still visible in the geography of some places, and the remaining communist architecture often shows which towns were in the former GDR. Temporary separation has also entrenched language differences that are subtly noticeable in the different names used to describe single objects. For example, the word for plastic is ‘', 'Plastik', '’ in the West and ‘', 'Plaste', '’ in the East.', 'There is also a faint cultural division noticeable in the social differences between the East and West. For example, the Eastern population is markedly less religious, older on average and is less ', 'multicultural', '.2 Social attitudes regarding political ideals can differ significantly depending on whether one lived in East or West Germany. For example, some people’s experience under communism has influenced them to be strongly opposed to leftist world views.', 'The economic disparity between the East and West is also still quite obvious and pronounced. It is perhaps one of the differences spoken about most frequently, as West German states pay a financial support tax to East Germany. East Germany suffered more material hardship over the course of its Soviet rule. After the reunification of Germany, most of the young and skilled East Germans migrated to the prosperous West. This continued to drain the East’s economy, which remains slightly weaker today. The East has a higher unemployment rate and less disposable income on average per person (Statistisches Bundesamt, 2014). Some Germans may express resentment about this disparity and the measures to amend it. The differences between East and West Germany often lead people to draw certain social conclusions about one another.', 'Social Hierarchies', 'Germans tend to differentiate one another on the basis of their social ranking. People generally pay more respect to those with expertise, evidence of a higher education and experience. One usually finds that the social ', 'hierarchy', ' structures authority around these qualities. Germans may also reflect on a person’s accent, region of origin and occupation to make conclusions about their social status and circumstances. However, class barriers were largely broken down after World War II. Most Germans had to rebuild their lives from scratch after losing most of their possessions or being displaced. Therefore, the class system is not deeply stratified; most Germans share the benefits of the strong middle class and receive a comprehensive, classical education.', 'As in every society, there are those who do not have as much privilege; a proportion of the population is unemployed (or underemployed). Recent refugee and immigration arrivals from the Middle East and North Africa also tend to find themselves in lower-paying occupations. Nevertheless, the dominant German attitude tends to aspire towards ensuring that everyone has equal access to opportunity regardless of their social background. According to Geert Hofstede’s cultural dimensions, Germany has a low ', 'power distance', ' score, indicating that there is an expectation of equality among society (regardless of whether this is the case).', 'Privacy and Socio-Relational Boundaries', 'Privacy is highly valued in Germany. People tend not to divulge a lot of personal information about themselves or discuss their political and social views when first meeting strangers. Some people may also prefer not to invite acquaintances to their homes on a regular basis, unless they have a close relationship. To foreigners, this can make Germans come across as distant. However, one can understand why privacy is so important when considering how it has been invaded by governments in the past. For example, those living in Germany during the Cold War were subjects of one of the most expansive and repressive secret citizen surveillance networks in human history (the', '\xa0Staatssicherheit', ' or ', 'Stasi', '). As such, some people are sensitive to sharing their personal information and take precautions to protect their privacy to the degree they feel personally comfortable with.', ""Personal privacy is also important to maintain the socio-relational boundaries between people's professional and personal lives. Germans tend to compartmentalise leisure and work time, distinguishing their relationships with people into one of these spheres. The social boundaries in this sense are quite strong. People generally keep a certain social distance from those they work with. For example, if talking about something personal in a colleague's life, one may hear a German say "", '“Das geht mich nichts an” ', '(That’s not my business). Individuals are expected to downplay any personal friendships they have with colleagues whilst in the office to detach their emotions from business. It can take some time for people to break through this social perimeter of privacy and the formality of the professional realm. This may give foreigners the impression that Germans are quite aloof. However, these boundaries dissipate among friends.', 'Germans are renowned for being very honest people, sometimes to the point of being bluntly critical of others’ actions. This assertiveness combined with their reserved approach to strangers can produce a misjudgement of them as having a standoffish public demeanor. Nevertheless, Germans usually become very open and personal once they find a common denominator with someone. From a German viewpoint, reserving warmth and friendly energy for those who are truly important to them gives their relationships greater integrity and value. Personal friendships are deeply prized. The time and sincerity involved in building such relationships can make them particularly durable and loyal.', 'Organisation and Directness', 'Germans are known for being industrious, orderly and punctual. The German expression “', 'Ordnung muss sein', '” (“there must be order”) reflects the cultural preference for organisation and methodical planning. Indeed, it also explains the preference for having one’s socio-relational boundaries clearly defined. People generally like to understand the context to interactions and what is required of them in certain scenarios. Germans generally arrange to meet one another by clarifying exactly when and where they will be meeting, for how long and what they will be doing. Things are rarely left to chance. Matters that proceed without a scheduled plan are likely to be directed by a relevant rule, regulation or social norm. This aspect of the culture is not so different from many industrialised cultures wherein people lead busy lives. However, it has produced a cliché of the typical German as highly efficient and matter-of-fact. This is likely due to the fact that such organisation is coupled with a very direct approach. In task-oriented cultures such as Germany, people do not always feel the necessity to build personal relationships in order to achieve a joint goal (see more information in ', 'Business Culture', '). While they are still courteous, they generally do not linger on small talk. Germans tend to be exceptionally honest and straight-to-the-point.', 'Demographic Changes', 'Germany classifies its citizens between ethnic Germans (meaning people with two parents of mostly or full German ancestry) and those of a migrant background (', 'Migrationshintergrund', ""). According to the Federal Statistical Office, the portion of the population with a migrant background has peaked for the fifth time in recent years. The 2016 microcensus reported that 22.5% of the country's residents, or more than 18.6 million people, were of immigrant or partially immigrant descent.4 However, it must be noted that ethnic German repatriates are included in this figure. Most "", 'Migrationshintergrund', ' people reside in the western states of Germany and Berlin. The eastern portion of Germany has fewer foreigners relative to the total population.', 'Germany has generally embraced its identity as a ', 'multicultural', ' (', 'Multi-Kulti', ') country. The nation has undergone some very big population shifts in the past 30 years. Since the fall of the Berlin Wall and the end of the Cold War, roughly 3 million ethnic Germans have returned from former Soviet countries. The country has also received big influxes of non-German migrants and refugees, particularly from Eastern Europe, North Africa, the Middle East and South Asia. Indeed, Germany is the second biggest migration destination in the world.5 The country has been a key flashpoint in Europe’s migrant crisis, receiving over a million asylum seekers since 2015. Such migration has been putting social and political stress on the country. The country is struggling to balance its national interests with international obligations. Ultimately, one cannot assume a German’s position on this matter or the current shifts occurring throughout Europe.', 'Past Experiences and Current Attitudes', 'In the past few decades, Germany has become recognised as an outward-looking nation, seeking to keep Europe united and help other countries and people in need. Indeed, Germany has transformed itself into a largely peaceful, forward-thinking and productive member of the global community of nations. However, the country may never be completely free of the spectre of its roles in the World Wars. It has undertaken a long process to overcome the guilt of its past. The word ‘', 'Vergangenheitsbewältigung', '’ describes this struggle to come to terms with the country’s negative history. Many Germans continue to be acutely aware that foreign perceptions of them take into account their country’s history. However, the ethos of German character has changed considerably from what it was during the early 20th century.', 'A strong focus on the value of critical thinking (', 'kritisches Denken', "") and tolerance has been formulated and ingrained into most Germans following the tragedy of World War II. From a young age, people are taught about the consequences of the population's past mistakes and the deadly side of nationalism that fuelled the Third Reich. They are encouraged to view everything with the lessons of the past in mind and assess the consequences of certain situations, as well as their responsibility to respond to them. As such, the population has developed quite strong pacifist ideals in reaction to their history. Many older Germans that have lived through the Cold War are also particularly aware of the importance of "", 'democratic', ' freedoms. Most people regard situations with a strong moral sensitivity in light of the country’s past.', 'As a result of this cultural attitude, there tends to be a cultural resistance to showing too much national pride. Many people feel sceptical or uncomfortable with patriotism, unable to detach it from the devastating effects of nationalism. Soccer tournaments often provide a safe environment that is dissociated from political and military contexts where Germans can display their patriotism proudly. However, people generally tend to be quite modest about their country’s capabilities. Repeated surveys by the University of Chicago’s National Opinion Research Center have found that Germany is one of the least patriotic countries in the world.6', 'Nevertheless, this aspect of the culture is arguably undergoing change. Some among the younger generation of Germans tend to be slightly more outgoing and less reluctant as they do not feel the taboo of the past is as relevant to them. Many Germans are also looking at the future direction their country should take, and saying that they need to move away from compensating for the past and start looking at their own domestic interests again. Meanwhile, the East German population is showing stronger nationalistic inclinations as many people who lived under Soviet rule are searching to reclaim their cultural traditions and pride in their identity.', '_____________________', '1\xa0Following Russia, which is transcontinental and largely located in Asia.2\xa0Statistisches Bundesamt, 20143 Statistisches Bundesamt, 20144 Statistisches Bundesamt, 20175 United Nations Population Division, 20156 Smith & Seokho, 2006', '']"

Greece has gained a global reputation due to the legacy of its ancient roots, particularly in Western philosophy. Greeks continue to pay homage to this heritage, as well as their more current national identity that centres around the Eastern Orthodox Christian tradition. Many aspects of Greek society have had to adapt to the pressures of the 21st century; however, family solidarity, generosity and ', 'interdependence', ' remain deeply important to people’s lives. Lively conversation and sincere, rational debates continue to be an integral part of how Greeks interact with one another.', 'Demographics', 'The Greek government does not collect information on the ethnic diversity of its citizens, but rather categorises them on the basis of whether they have citizenship or are foreign migrants. There is one minority officially recognised by the government – the Thráki (Thrace) people. However, there are also large numbers of people identifying as Turks, North Macedonians, Albanians, Bulgarians, Vlachs and Roma.', 'The official language is Greek. This is traditionally written in a distinct alphabet that ranges from alpha (Αα) to omega (Ωω). There are also some regional dialects spoken throughout the country, such as Cypriot and Pontian. However, most of the population that speaks a local dialect is bilingual and also understands standard Greek.', 'National Identity', 'Greece is geographically located in the east of Europe and has a majority Eastern Orthodox Christian population. However, unlike other Eastern Orthodox European countries, it is mostly associated with the West. This is partly because Greece managed to remain outside of Russia’s sphere of influence after World War II; it allied with Western Europe and has been a long-term member of the European Union (EU). Furthermore, ancient Greece is generally regarded to be the birthplace of Western civilization. Its contributions to political thought, philosophy and science continue to be central to Western culture.', 'Greek society is deeply patriotic. Though they may be critical of the current state of the country, people generally express strong feelings of cultural superiority and national pride. In 2017, the Pew Research Center found that 89% of Greeks agreed with the sentiment “Our people are not perfect, but our culture is superior to others”. Greece’s ancient heritage and legacies often contribute to this sentiment. People are also very proud of the fact that Greece has always been on what has been perceived as ‘the right side of history’, having always allied with defenders of ', 'democratic', ' rights.', 'Conversation', 'An association is often made between Greek culture and the famous philosophers and thinkers of ancient Greece. Though this is an outdated representation of modern-day Greece, the culture still values rational debate and thoughtful reflection. Intellect is greatly admired and often a determiner of social status. Decisions based on reason are highly respected by society, and healthy rational argument is enjoyed. As such, the Greeks are passionate and animated debaters. They often like to test their intelligence by attempting to persuade others with strongly held opinions, perhaps creatively drawing upon knowledge of a wide variety of subjects to make their case. It is common to see ', '‘kavgádes’ ', '(matches or arguments) erupt on the street. These impassioned discussions may provide brief entertainment for onlookers, but generally end without hard feelings and lingering emotions.', 'To fully understand the Greek communication style, one must appreciate their love for discussion. ', '‘Kefi’', ' refers to the contentment, bliss and joy one feels when a moment is so overwhelmingly enjoyable they are transported by it. The Greeks recognise kefi arising when an engaging conversation with good company becomes particularly delighting and fulfilling. As such, they may enter or initiate discussion hoping it will stimulate them and achieve kefi.', 'Philotimo', 'The concept of ', '‘philotimo’', ' also has a strong cultural influence in Greece. Meaning ‘sense of honour’ (which translates as ‘love of honour’), philotimo is unable to be fully described in English. However, it is closely related to a personal compulsion to “do the right thing”. Philotimo is a person’s inner awareness of their dignity and pride that motivates them to fulfil their social responsibility and duty even if it puts the individual at a personal disadvantage. In this way, honour is derived from doing things for others that are beyond one’s own self-interest, whether it be to their family, friends or country. For example, a person’s philotimo would be questioned if they were acting like a ', '‘tzampatzis’ ', '(free rider) who is only concerned about their own personal benefit.', 'In ancient Greece, the higher calling of one’s philotimo was thought to explain how people were prepared to die for their country in battles. Greeks very much feel that the concept of philotimo is something unique to their community and national character, binding them together. Today, it perhaps explains why they are so comfortable relying on each other’s word rather than writing agreements in contracts. There is a mutual understanding that, by one’s philotimo, one will fulfil their promise. They are accountable to their own moral compass and those around them.', 'Interdependence', 'Greece is a collectivist society in the sense that there is strong loyalty shown to familial and social groups. The social life of many Greeks is usually kept to a close circle of family and friends. These personal relationships are deeply important to people’s day-to-day life. Under the promise of friendship, people perform favours for one another, from old school friends to former neighbours. This ', 'interdependence', ' has been largely driven by necessity, as the government cannot always be relied upon to provide support. It is common for Greeks to call upon contacts to act as a ', '‘meso’', ' (intermediary/connection) to help them accomplish things. For example, friends and family connections can be crucial to helping a person bridge opportunities, get introduced, obtain information, gain access to authority or navigate around the ', 'bureaucracy', '. Some people resent being in a position where they have to use a meso; however, it is often inevitable.', 'Day-to-Day Life', 'Greeks tend to structure their lives around the immediate social relationships important to them, taking an easy-going approach to time and socialisation. Society is not tightly organised and schedules are not closely followed. Those from rural or coastal areas and the older generation in particular tend to adopt quite a relaxed and slow pace of life, devoting more time to personal interactions. Afternoon naps are also a regular part of many people’s days. Nevertheless, misconceptions occur when people perceive this cultural milieu to mean that Greeks are lazy. According to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, Greeks work more hours than any other Europeans. A stereotype about their work ethic (or lack thereof) has perhaps been formed because a lot of socialisation occurs in the public eye.', 'Public spaces play a large role in community relationships, especially in summer. For example, outdoor cafes and coffee shops provide a place for Greeks to mingle without having to necessarily plan an occasion. People enjoy congregating to catch up with friends and hear the latest news. There is also a popular tradition of taking a leisurely stroll down the town promenade in the late afternoon/early evening – known as ', '‘volta’.', ' This is especially common on the Greek islands. Informal social events such as these reinforce a sense of community belonging.', 'Insecurity', 'Greek society has undergone a difficult transformation following the severe economic crisis that struck the country in 2009. The country is still suffering from the effects of this over a decade later. One of the most visible indications is the large proportion of buildings across Greece that are either abandoned or unfinished due to various financial circumstances. Almost everybody knows of someone who has lost their job, pension or even their house. Unemployment remains a serious problem, especially for youth. There is very little ability to project into the future, meaning it is difficult to be forward planning. Such insecurity has forced many Greeks to reassess their priorities.', 'Some are finding that the lessons inherited from older generations are not always suitable to deal with the current social climate. For example, many people used to be able to ‘get by’ without necessarily having to safeguard or worry about their future, approaching situations with a laid-back attitude. ', '‘Ohaderfismos’ ', 'describes the mentality of responding to problems with the easy-going sentiment “Oh brother, who cares?”. Today, many Greeks no longer have the luxury to disregard the difficulties of the current precarious economic situation. Some may even find this laid-back attitude to be partially responsible for the situation the country now finds itself. People have become quite cautious and wary of ambiguity.

Throughout history, there has been a constant struggle for Hungarians to find their own voice and identity while under the control of various forces (such as the Ottoman Empire, the Habsburgs and the Soviet Union). Today, these struggles continue to influence Hungarian society and attitudes. For example, some Hungarians still look back at certain periods of time in the past as Hungary’s golden years, whilst others seek to focus on the country and people’s present achievements. Today, Hungarians have a distinctive identity that is often exhibited through their pride in cuisine, high standard of hospitality, language and other traditions and customs unique to Hungary (', 'hungarikum', ').', 'Ethnic Interactions', 'Within Hungary, the majority of the population identify as ethnically Hungarian (85.6%). Hungarians may call themselves ‘Magyars’, a term that specifically refers to both the ethnic group and the language. In the post-WWI period, Hungary was compelled to sign the Treaty of Trianon, which led to the redrawing of the country’s borders. This meant that Hungarians lost two-thirds of the country’s total land. Consequently, more than 3 million Hungarians were located in neighbouring countries. Some families were forced to leave their homes or were separated from other family members. At the end of the communist period (1989), the Hungarian government assumed responsibility for supporting ethnic Hungarians living outside the country’s borders. Many ethnic Hungarians living outside of Hungary in these regions still keep strong cultural ties with the motherland and are often known as ‘Hungarians from across the border’.', 'Of the remaining population, 3.2% identify as Roma, 1.9% identify as German, 2.6% identify with some other ', 'ethnicity', ' and 14.1% are unspecified.1 The Roma population is usually underestimated in official statistics and may represent 5-10% of Hungary’s population. They tend to live nomadic lifestyles and typically have disadvantageous economic positions and social status. The relationship between the Hungarian majority and Roma minority is complex, reflecting tensions between the two ethnic groups.', 'There is also a considerably large Jewish population in Hungary, although the population is often considered a religious community rather than an ethnic community. In turn, they are not identified in census data as an ', 'ethnicity', '. Nevertheless, the Jewish presence in Hungary is significant, considering the context of its historical, cultural and intellectual legacy. In recent times, the Jewish community has decreased in size, with many migrating abroad in part due to fear of discrimination. More information about the Jewish community in Hungary can be found in the ', 'Religion', ' section under ', 'Judaism in Hungary', '.', 'Hungarian Society and Stratification', 'The communist period diminished many of the social and economic differences that were once present in Hungary. During the communist era, most people had secure jobs with a steady income, yet felt discontent towards the government. In the post-communist period, life became uncertain with the reduction in job security and massive changes to the economy. Additionally, many services and industries were privatised, including housing. This continues to impact Hungary, whereby financial matters, such as housing, continue to be a point of concern for many. With the lack of available housing and rising cost of houses, it is becoming increasingly difficult for many to own a house (see ', 'Household Structure', ' in ', 'Family', ' for more information).', 'Today, Hungarian society is becoming more stratified in light of changes in the post-communist era. Many Hungarians are moving abroad to seek employment opportunities. One way this is making a significant impact on Hungarian society is the shortage of medical practitioners. For some, the standard of health care is believed to be problematic, and it can be difficult to receive adequate health care. Older Hungarians often tend to attribute economic changes (such as the rising cost of living) to the government rather than global factors. This mentality is a legacy of the communist era, wherein the government controlled nearly all facets of society.', 'Hungarians tend to be quite individualistic, meaning that the interests of oneself and one’s immediate family take priority. Hungarians rely on their close friends and family for support. For many Hungarians, close friends and family will be the first people they reach out to in a time of need, rather than the broader community or institutions.', 'Demeanour and Attitudes', 'A common attitude among many Hungarians is a sense of sombreness and nostalgia. One will often express discontent about past events, present conditions or doubts about their own future (see\xa0', 'Communication', '). Some Hungarians tend to be past-oriented, often looking at the past as greater than the present. For example, some Hungarians look at the pre-Trianon era as a time in which Hungary was flourishing economically and the standard of living was higher. This tendency is referred to as Trianon Syndrome and has reemerged at various points in history. In the post-communist period, Trianon Syndrome resurfaced and continues today among some Hungarians. Some are still concerned about the events surrounding the Treaty of Trianon while others prefer to look beyond the event. This split in attitude is evident in political, social and cultural life. For example, some consider dates of significance as defeats from the past, while others look to celebrate the successes of Hungary, such as achievements in the sciences, scholarship and arts.', 'Another common trait among Hungarians is their adaptability. Throughout history, Hungarians have had to adapt to various social, political and economic changes. Today on a more local level, if obstacles appear in front of Hungarians, they will often try to find a way around them. This is reflected in the Hungarian saying, ', '“A zúrt nagykapu mellett, mindig van egy\xa0kiskapu”', "" ('If the big gate is closed, there’s always a little gate open'). For example, there was a point in time where people were unable to buy fridges in Hungary.

Indeed, Hungarians tend to enjoy hosting and socialising with their friends and family. Food is often a major point of socialising among Hungarians as well as a major source of pride. Many believe food is deeply important and much pride is associated with Hungarian cuisine. Particular Hungarian cuisine elements, such as the spice known as paprika, are highly cherished.', 'Geographic Distinctions', 'A longstanding divide between the rural and urban culture in Hungary continues unabated. On the one hand, Hungarian traditions in the countryside were preserved by rural customs, village life and folklore. On the other hand, cities were the centre of education and innovation. At times, some question which culture – urban or rural – is more representative of contemporary Hungary.', 'Nowadays, over 70% of the Hungarian population reside in urban areas. The capital city of Budapest dominates the country, both in terms of population size and concentration within its borders, as the place where most of the country’s scientific, scholarly and artistic institutions are located.

Nearly the whole population speak Hungarian, also known as Magyar (99.6%). While the language varies according to the region, the various dialects are understood to nearly all Hungarians throughout the country. The Hungarian language is unique among the European nations as it is a part of the Uralic language family, as opposed to the Indo-European language family.

Literature has also played a significant role in forming Irish culture and identity. The country is known for producing many distinguished writers like Oscar Wilde, James Joyce and William Butler Yeats.', 'In contemporary Ireland, the diversity of expression informs the way in which the Irish appreciate the experience of others and express their own. Respect for creativity and expression is found throughout the country and abroad. For example, many Irish children are taught to play traditional instruments as a way to carry on ancient Celtic traditions. Moreover, Irish dancing is increasingly popular, with Irish dancing teachers all over the world teaching second-, third- and fourth-generation Irish children traditional jigs and reels.', '_____________________', '1 The term ', 'craic', ' may also be used to refer to an activity as ‘fun’, ‘enjoyable’ or a ‘great time’.

Its land neighbours France, Switzerland, Austria and Slovenia to the north, with the Alps stretching across the northern border. Italy is home to the epicentre of the Roman Empire, the hub of Catholicism and the birthplace of the Renaissance. It has a rich heritage in art, history, religion, cuisine, architecture and fashion. These cultural legacies have been deeply influential in defining Western cultural tradition.', 'Italian culture continues to be romanticised across the globe, so much so that it can be hard for people to stop recalling clichéd ideas of Italians. Nevertheless, as one of the top 10 exporters in the world, Italy greatly benefits from its cultural products. Indeed, they have become a huge economic asset for the country. Italians have successfully subverted their national stereotypes into proud virtues. Italians themselves are commonly known for being flexible, confident and charming people. Their playful and lively communication style often gives foreigners the impression that they are enthusiastic and appreciative of what life has to offer.', 'Local Patriotism (Campanilismo)', 'It took a long time for Italy’s separate states to unify compared to other European countries, and it has been a republic only since 1946. As such, the Italian population continues to be very provincial. People tend to identify themselves by their region, city, town, village or even their ‘', 'quartiere', '’ (a district within a town). For example, a person from Siena in Tuscany may feel ‘Sienese’ whilst in Tuscany, but ‘Tuscan’ when they are anywhere else in Italy. Connection and loyalty to one’s township or locality is often stronger than one’s connection with Italy as a country. This is not to say Italians are unpatriotic – they are very proud of their nation. Indeed, Italians generally feel their Italian identity most intensely when overseas. However, nationalism is not typically a very strong motivating factor for the population. It is instead often overtaken by the overwhelming spirit of ‘', 'campanilismo', '’.', 'Campanilismo', ' describes Italian local patriotism. The word originates from the age-old rivalries between townships, represented in the saying “our bell tower (', 'campanile', ') is taller than yours”. People’s pride and loyalty to their locality was symbolised in the bell tower for it was generally the tallest building in the area. Today, Italians continue to feel a deep, loyal ', 'campanilismo', ', especially in those towns or villages that are populated by families that have lived in the region for generations. Some places even continue to display their township’s traditional coat of arms.', 'This local patriotism attitude arose out of a historic and mutual mistrust between Italy’s villages, towns and cities. Until 1860, they were divided as different states that were often at war or in competition with each other. They tended to be self-sufficient and independent, developing different cultural characteristics to their neighbouring provinces. Old local rivalries are now mostly spoken of in good humour. However, the cultural distinctions between different regions within Italy continue to be very noticeable in their dialects, cuisine, daily lifestyles and cultural traditions.', 'Regional Differences', 'Sensitivities surrounding the Italian identity can arise in areas where past geopolitical changes have annexed regions and subsumed others into Italy. This is particularly noticeable around the northern region where Italy borders France, Switzerland, Austria and Slovenia. For example, the Italian province of Alto Adige (South Tyrol) was historically incorporated with the area of Tirol above it in Austria until World War I. Its citizens arguably share more cultural heritage with this northern region, having belonged to the German-speaking world for centuries. Today, more people in Alto Adige speak South Tyrolese German at home and in public than Italian, and their Germanic culture continues to thrive.', 'Also, there are approximately 530,000 Friulian speakers in the region of Friuli-Venezia Giulia that borders Austria and Slovenia, and many Italians living in the provinces of Trieste and Gorizia, bordering Slovenia speak Slovene.', '1', '\xa0The largest linguistic minority is the Sardu speakers on the island of Sardinia, where an estimated 1.3 million people speak their local language in preference to Italian.', '2', ' It should be noted that while there is great linguistic diversity, many people are bilingual or even tri-lingual. They often speak their local regional dialect and standard Italian, as well as the language of the country their region borders.', 'Geographical Differences', 'Italians may talk of a social distinction between the north and south of the country. The north industrialised in the latter half of the 19th century and is generally perceived as being more modern, individualistic and business-minded. Most of Italy’s biggest metropolises (Rome, Venice, Milan and Florence) are found in the north or centre of the country. Meanwhile, the cities in the south (below Rome) are typically slightly smaller. The south is often associated with traditional family-oriented values and a slower pace of life. Some of these characteristics are clear to see, while others are maintained through stereotypes often associated with each region.', ""The differences between the north and south may be somewhat reflected in the country's urban-rural divide. Italians from cosmopolitan cities are acquainted with a fast pace of life suited to the industrious and technological environment. Meanwhile, rural areas tend to have an older age demographic and are generally less crowded. Mountainous and coastal areas are often considered touristic for their relaxed, characteristically Mediterranean approach. There may be light resentment between those from rural areas and those from cities; northerners sometimes feel they are economically supporting the south. However, in reality, the differences between the north and south of Italy are dissipating as socioeconomic circumstances improve across the country. Furthermore, rural life is on a general decline throughout Italy as there is a persistent trend of migration to cities for employment, particularly among youth."", 'Reputation and ‘Fare\xa0la Bella Figura’', 'Italian culture places much importance on an individual’s reputation or honour. It is perceived to reflect their family and upbringing, and is essentially a way of opening up opportunities. In Italy, a person’s honour is defined by the impression they leave on others – ', '‘fare la bella figura’ ', '(which literally means ‘making a good image’). ', 'Fare la bella figura', ' describes the art of making a good impression. It not only refers to a person’s physical appearance, but the aura they project in the way they hold themselves. It should be reflected in everything they do, from what they say to how they act.', 'The cultural emphasis on making a good impression may be seen as superficial, but that’s not necessarily the case. For example, in the lower class, it often relates to maintaining one’s grace and dignity despite modest circumstances. Furthermore, considering a good reputation involves social approval, the ability to accommodate different points of view and appease people with diverse interests is thought to be one of the biggest virtues. Someone who carries themselves with a good image (', 'fa bella figura', ') is thought to have confidence, style, an elegant demeanour and engaging social skills. In this way, ', 'bella figura', ' has almost become an expression of the Italian character.', 'In accordance with the attention paid to one’s reputation, there is a cultural emphasis on one’s personal presentation in appearance and action. This can lead people to be quite materialistic (for example, judging another person by the brand of cigarette they smoke). Italians typically take care to ensure their attire appropriately suits the occasion. For the upper class, this involves wearing fashionable clothes and displaying lavish belongings. Those from the middle and lower classes tend to dress less distinctively, but maintain a neat and sophisticated decorum, looking dapper. Italians’ personal presentation is often noticed by foreigners, who remark on their grace and charm.', 'Sociability', 'As Italian culture has a deep focus on relationships, socialisation is important on both a formal and informal level. Public spaces play a large role in this. For example, ', 'piazzas', ' (public squares) provide a place for Italians to mingle without having to necessarily plan an occasion. There is also a popular tradition of taking a gentle stroll through the town in the late afternoon/early evening, usually on a Sunday – the ‘', 'la passeggiata', '’.

Despite being a casual occasion, people often dress very well for these little ritual walks. The stroll and conversations along the way are an opportunity to observe others, be seen and leave a good public impression (', 'la bella figura', ' – ', 'see above', '). Informal social events such as these reinforce a sense of community belonging. Older people may sit at cafes on popular streets and watch or wait to be spoken to by those passing. Indeed, ', 'al fresco', ' (outdoor) dining is popular as it allows people to enjoy their meal in a social setting and observe the public without being the centre of attention.

The Maltese language (Malti) is the only European language in the Afro-Asiatic family, making Malta linguistically unique.

This means that language plays an important role in creating a unified sense of identity among the Maltese people. Nonetheless, nearly all Maltese speak English and some understand Italian.', 'Maltese tend not to identify as ‘European’ despite being a part of the EU. Rather, there is a general perception that Malta is a unique country that acts as a bridge between Europe and Northern Africa.

Located in the centre of the Mediterranean Sea, the Maltese archipelago consists of Malta, Gozo, Comino, Cominotto and Filfla. Most of the population reside on Malta – the largest island – and the rest live on Gozo, with the exception of a few farmers on Comino. Those who reside on Gozo may refer to themselves as Gozitans to identify themselves regionally when conversing with other Maltese.', 'Generally speaking, there is social and cultural ', 'homogeneity', ' among Maltese villages. The structure of urban and rural areas tends to be similar, with people residing in villages that surround a local parish church. The local community and family play an important role in the social structure of Malta (see ', 'Social Interactions', ' below). In part due to the size of the islands and villages, privacy is rare and attempts to be anonymous may prove challenging.', 'The pace of life in Malta tends to be slow and relaxed, in part due to the seaside, small-town environment paired with sunny weather. The warm climate allows for many outdoor settings for socialising; for example, many will go out to the piazza to socialise. Some say that life in Malta is somewhat isolated due to the location of the islands. Nonetheless, technology has enabled Maltese to be in touch with the world, particularly the European continent. Given that Maltese are well aware of the world around them, they acknowledge and generally accept differences in opinions and behaviours but do not easily tolerate those with a fast-paced approach to life.', 'Cultural Influences', 'Malta has been the crossroads between Europe and Northern Africa for centuries, a fact that is reflected in the people, culture and lifestyle of contemporary Maltese. Arabic cultures (mainly those from Northern Africa) have made an imprint on Maltese culture.

Indeed, Malta was once a colony of Britain (1814) and remained a part of the Commonwealth until it became an independent state in 1964. Remnants of Britain’s presence remain – for example, the prevalence of the English language.', 'Social Interactions', 'Malta is a hierarchical society and stratification tends to occur through education and economic status. This plays a large role in social interactions, as what is considered to be ‘correct’ behaviour is dependent on one’s status, the degree of familiarity, age and social connections. There is an expectation that one will be modest and will avoid boasting about one’s wealth, putting oneself above others or dressing provocatively. Moreover, maintaining one’s reputation and dignity is considerably important to ensure one is respected as an individual as well as to protect the honour of one’s family. Indeed, every level of interaction is shaped by the family structure in Malta. This is partly due to the population density, meaning family reputations are well-known between generations. As such, the family one comes from is an important determinant in constructing one’s public and private identity.', 'The younger generation tends to be more individualistic while older generations generally maintain a collectivistic attitude. Though the younger generation of Malta are proud of their country’s history, many attempt to distance themselves from what they consider to be the ‘traditional’ Maltese way of life. For them, Maltese culture is often thought of as unchanging or static. The youth tend to prefer to associate with the culture and attitudes from Western Europe, Britain and the United States that they can access through social media.', 'At times, Maltese people may seem reserved. However, they are quite warm and often very hospitable and generous towards family and friends.

The shoreline was extended by building dikes in the ocean and then pumping the water out of the area between the dikes and the original shoreline. This required hard work and skillful engineering, which is often reflected in the Dutch saying, ""God made the earth, but the Dutch made the Netherlands"". This industriousness prevails today. The Netherlands\' open economy and history of social tolerance have given it a reputation as being a liberal, globalised and progressive country.', 'Geographic Distinctions', 'The Netherlands has two major cultural regions. The first is the ', '‘Randstad’', "", which refers to the ‘Rim City' or ‘City on the Edge'. The Randstad encompasses the provinces of North Holland, South Holland and Utrecht in the shape of a horseshoe.

Despite this size, the Macedonian people have a strong national psyche. They take their citizenship very seriously and often seek recognition of their country’s history and culture. Many also have deep pride on the local level, maintaining strong connections to their regional identities. On a more day-to-day basis, Macedonians are warm, generous and hospitable people. Modern Macedonian society has been flourishing since independence. In spite of the enormous pressure and attempts to destabilise the new country (both from internal and external forces), the Macedonian state has progressed tremendously in recent years. The population has been innovative and welcoming of new ideas, practices and development.', 'National Formation and Cultural History', 'Macedonians trace their history and culture back to at least 333 BCE during the time of Alexander the Great. Under his rule, the Macedonian Empire had power and territory across Greece, Thrace, Asia Minor/Anatolia, Egypt, Iran and Afghanistan, reaching India. Modern day Macedonians remain very proud of this conquest and legacy; their claim and connection to this point in history is very important to informing ideas of their identity. Following Alexander the Great’s death and the slow dissolution of the Macedonian Empire, the land of Macedonia became part of the Roman Empire, the Byzantine Empire and finally the Ottoman Empire. The military occupation by the Ottoman Empire lasted for 550 years until Macedonia was partitioned in 1912 and 1913 as a result of the Balkan Wars. At this point, the land was split between Bulgaria, Greece, Serbia and Albania. Modern-day North Macedonia was formed as a republic under former Yugoslavia after World War II. In 1991, it obtained national independence peacefully.', 'Being a young sovereign nation (less than 30 years old), a sense of cultural unification is still developing in Macedonia. There are cultural remnants of countries that once occupied it which are noticeable in the different dialects and social customs across certain regions. Ultimately, North Macedonia has a long history of involvement with three very distinct cultural traditions. There is a strong Christian Orthodox culture, an Islamic culture connected to the region’s Turkic Ottoman past, and also a Jewish connection. All of these are crucial to Macedonians’ understanding of their nation, though the first has come to be the dominant understanding of the Macedonian cultural mainstream as it reflects the ethnic Macedonian majority (more on this under ', 'Ethnic Distinctions', ' below).', 'National Identity and Patriotism', 'Macedonian society is deeply patriotic. While their country has only recently gained independence, many Macedonians proudly associate their national identity with the ancient culture and history of the region described above. However, they have been affected by the scrutiny and denial of this cultural identity by others. Since independence, neighbouring countries have contested the legitimacy of the Macedonian identity, heritage, territory and state. As examples, the country’s former name – Republic of Macedonia – was the subject of a dispute with Greece (see ', 'The Naming Dispute', '\xa0in ', 'Other Considerations', ' for information on this), and there is ongoing disagreement over whether and how much modern-day ethnic Macedonians are descendants of the ancient Macedonians from the era of Alexander the Great.', ""The arguments often hinge on technical claims surrounding ancient history, and are provoked by the fact that North Macedonia is a newly independent country in a historic region.

As a result, many Macedonians feel threatened and marginalised in both North Macedonia and Australia. They recognise that as a small country they are seen as a low priority in international relations, and hence feel their voice is somewhat neglected and ignored.

The fact remains that citizens living in North Macedonia have always known themselves as “Macedonians” and have a historical connection to the land. One may find that they seek recognition of this and assert their right to be known as such in interactions. Indeed, their persistent feeling of being misunderstood and marginalised has contributed to a complex national psyche whereby Macedonians are often very nationalistic and feel obliged to defend and explain themselves.

Many towns and communities have been historically ', 'multicultural', ', and Muslims and Christians have coexisted peacefully for centuries. However, the relationship between ethnic Macedonians and ethnic Albanians has degraded since independence and has become one of Macedonia’s biggest cultural sensitivities and struggles.

Civil war between the two ethnicities was narrowly avoided in 2001 when Albanians’ mobilised following their increasing dissatisfaction at their perceived unequal treatment and social discrimination. While agreements were reached to rectify the situation, there continue to be ongoing tensions and a low level of trust between the two groups. Violence can erupt periodically.

In 2015, approximately 58.8% of the total population lived in urban areas.2 However, Macedonians are notably adaptable people. Some have been turning to the Internet to provide an alternative source of income, and many men are self-proclaimed ‘handymen’ with a broad set of trade skills. As it is often too expensive to pay for labour, most people try to fix or build things themselves with the help of friends or family. This self-reliance and do-it-yourself approach reflects the traditional agricultural lifestyles of the Balkans.', 'Macedonians also generally have quite a relaxed and slow pace of life, particularly those from rural areas and the older generations.

Important specific appointments will be scheduled; however, people generally don’t strictly plan or allocate time for socialising.

The neighbourhood is essential to people’s support network, especially for those whose kin live far away. This is partly because many families would have lived in the same village or town together for generations. However, it also relates to the collectivist nature of the culture. In Macedonia, people usually know all their close neighbours and many others throughout their town. They visit each other and socialise regularly, often spontaneously.', 'In such tightly knit communities, everyone knows one another and one’s family background implies a lot about a person. This lack of privacy means word of a family’s business can circulate quickly. Thus, Macedonians are generally careful when seeking support to make sure their grievances don’t become the subject of community ‘gossip’ and embarrass the household name. However, the intimate neighbourhood also gives a sense of belonging and safety. Macedonians living in the English-speaking West can find the experience quite isolating initially as such societies are generally more individualistic.', '_____________________', '1 Mojsoska-Blazevski et al., 20162\xa0Central Intelligence Agency, 2020']"

Its culture has changed rapidly since the collapse of the Soviet-controlled communist regime. The post-communist era has propelled a new national order, attitude and optimism in the past 30 years. Amidst this, some people are still adapting to the shifts in society. A broad diversity of lifestyles have flourished and some of the younger generation have begun embracing more liberal values. Traditionalism and conservatism remain evident in the country’s religious landscape, social customs and core values. Poles also continue to show sentimentality over the past and a tendency to romanticise ideas. However, this is accompanied with a sharp practicality and realistic mindset.', 'Polish society is quite hierarchical and there is a general acceptance of social positions. There has been a longstanding cultural distinction between the rural/peasant population and urban intellectuals throughout history. However, the Polish countryside has changed enormously and the intelligentsia are in the process of transformation into the middle class. The population is largely united across different socioeconomic backgrounds through shared conviction in family values and egalitarianism. Indeed, Poland’s deep grounding in family values leads the country to be more collectivistic than many other Western countries. As a result, it regularly gets misleadingly defined as ‘Eastern’ when compared to Central Europe. However, Poles have traditionally thought of themselves as the ‘softest’ of all the Slavs.', 'Past Experiences', 'The Polish are conscious of their recent history and many social attitudes remain influenced and motivated by past events. It is widely acknowledged that the country suffered greatly over the 20th century. Almost every Polish family would have been affected to varying degrees by the persecution and trauma of the second World War. In the post-war period, Poland came under Soviet control – only gaining independence in 1989. These years featured general industrialisation, urbanisation and many improvements in the standard of living in Poland. However, the communist regime was marred by social unrest, severe economic difficulties, bureaucratic obstacles and the suppression of certain self-expression and personal freedom. As a result of this period’s impact, many people continue to be rather sceptical of politics and mistrusting of overriding authority.', 'The national anthem of Poland reflects its history of struggle, proclaiming in its title ', '“Jeszcze Polska nie zginęła”', ' – “Poland Has Not Yet Perished”. Many Poles see the tragedy of the past to be integral in forming the Polish identity. Nevertheless, one can misperceive Polish culture when only drawing upon the 20th century to inform ideas. Poles have often been characterised as sombre, serious people. While this stereotype may still hold some truth for the older generation, it is generally unrepresentative of modern-day attitudes. Many Poles consider themselves to be quite relaxed and other Slavic countries often think of them as ‘unserious’ people. The country has progressed immensely in many areas; the culture is becoming increasingly fast-paced and success-oriented, reflecting globalisation and growth, and there has been a noticeable shift towards optimism. In a recent survey, 76% of Poles reported they were either very or moderately satisfied with their living standards.', 'Nobility and Ethics', 'Justice and morality appear to be guiding principles in Poland and people seem to have an awareness of the nobility underpinning their actions. This is likely a result of the country’s tumultuous history, as well as the Catholic Church promoting ideas of forgiveness and mercy. The royal family also traditionally promoted goodwill in their public statements and actions. In this way, there has been a strong tradition of generosity and clemency in Poland; people tend to empathise quickly and appeal to others’ understanding when needing an allowance or favour. They are also quite aware of whether their actions are perceived to be honourable in others’ eyes. This cultural quality has seen the Polish begin to serve as an emerging example of peace and unity on the global stage, proudly heading the EU alliance in 2011. On a more day-to-day basis, it is expected that all business and social exchanges are ', '‘po ludzku’ ', '(conducted in a humane manner).', 'Interaction', 'In line with the generous nature of Polish culture, people are noticeably cordial and chivalrous. They often help one another even if it requires significant effort. On the surface, individuals also dress neatly and may display their religion visibly. Australians can perceive this demeanour as overly formal or conservative, especially in regard to the courtesy shown towards women. However, the Polish actually tend to be quite unreserved.', 'One may find that casual relationships seem rather intimate as Poles are often honest and open about their emotions to others. The ‘Polski temperament’ has become the common phrase used to describe this willingness to express their feelings. They are quite comfortable sharing their thoughts even when they differ, as they do not immediately see disagreements of opinion to be detrimental to personal rapport. In this way, conversation can be colourful as people debate and explore ideas without judgement of character. However, if people argue without graciousness or cannot ‘let go’ of a topic and move on, it becomes more socially unacceptable.', 'Sometimes Poles may justify and defend themselves quite strongly if they feel their nobility has been unduly criticised. However, most expect to be pulled into line when they are doing something inappropriate. People generally have little hesitation in redressing wrongs and misunderstandings quickly to clear the air. The general Polish approach is straightforward: the sooner the problem is dealt with, the quicker it’s resolved.', 'Problem Solving', 'The Poles are known to be good improvisers and quite comfortable adapting to situations. While people appreciate rules and schedules, the reality is that they may not work or are subject to change under unpredictable circumstances. Thus, while certain systems and arrangements may be in place, they are rarely thought of as totally concrete. This cultural tolerance for imprecision and flexibility can encourage spontaneity and a light disregard for law and order in daily life (i.e. getting out of a car stopped at a traffic light). To non-Polish people, this approach to time and problem solving can seem disorganised or frivolous. However, such actions are practically minded and seen as a capable way of navigating around situations. In communist times, this flexibility and figure-it-out-yourself attitude was helpful to get things done. Today, improvisation is less prevalent in business and personal matters. However, a common attitude prevails – ', 'if you don’t seek to help yourself, even God can’t help you.', 'Stoicism has also become a well-recognised quality of the Polish character. People tend to deal with more serious issues without much complaint. However, some may also handle problems as they occur instead of working to prevent them. This reflects a cultural tendency to optimistically romanticise ideas and, in turn, underestimate or minimise problems. For example, one often hears the turn of phrase “', 'Jakoś to będzie”', ', meaning ‘things will somehow turn out okay by the end’, or ', '“Dobra, dobra”', ' (‘easy, easy’ – everything will be alright) in response to complaints.']"

It borders Spain to the country’s north and east while the Atlantic Ocean lies to the south and west. Portugal occupies the westernmost point in Europe and has a long, exposed coastline; these geographic characteristics have made it a historical focal point for invaders, seafarers and explorers. Most Portuguese are proud of their cultural heritage, particularly the country’s deep affiliations with the ocean.', 'Political changes, especially through the construction and dismantling of the country’s colonial empire, have significantly shaped Portugal. For example, António de Oliveira Salazar (the dictator of Portugal from 1926 to 1968) promoted the ‘Three Fs’ of society: the ', 'fado', ' (a sombre Portuguese folk song), ', 'Fátima', ' (a Catholic shrine in central Portugal, symbolising devotion to Catholicism) and ', 'futebol', ' (soccer). These three elements continue to be central to the Portuguese identity. Perhaps reserved and formal at first, Portuguese are generally deeply expressive and warm people.', 'Geography, Environment and Lifestyles', 'Portugal has been profoundly influenced by the country’s proximity to the Atlantic Ocean and the region’s mild climate. Many take pride in their country’s history and traditions in seafaring. Moreover, the environment has helped create the relaxed, slow-paced lifestyle of most Portuguese. For those residing near the coastline, visiting the beach is a popular pastime, particularly in the region known as the Algarve.', 'A highly treasured element of Portuguese culture and lifestyle is the production and sharing of food. The long coastline of the country has helped create a national cuisine heavily based on fresh seafood. Further inland, it is common to see an abundance of fresh fruits, vegetables and other agricultural products. Many Portuguese feel connected to the land through the experience of cultivating farms and creating food from the produce. Eating food is seen as a communal affair, where people gather to partake in food and drink (such as wine) as a way to bond with one another. Thus, the experience of food – from its production to preparation – is a great source of pride for many Portuguese.', 'A common distinction in Portugal is between the regions to the south and north of the Rio Tejo (Tagus River). The two regions differ in customs, traditions and geography. For example, the ', 'Alentejo', ' (‘beyond the Tejo’ or ‘south of the Tejo’) has Moorish influence due to its proximity to Northern Africa. One way the Moorish influence is evident is in words beginning with ‘', 'Al-', '‘ (e.g. ‘', 'Algarve', '’, the southernmost region of Portugal). The distinction between the north and south has somewhat changed due to population distribution. In Portugal, population distribution is quite urban-centric, concentrated along the coastlines. Seaside towns and cities have high population densities as many migrate in hopes of better employment opportunities in the country’s economic hubs. Some rural areas have experienced considerable population losses as a result of this phenomenon, which in turn has had severe effects on local economies. This is most evident in parts of the north and the southern inland areas.', 'In urban parts of Portugal, many rent or own an ‘', 'andar', '’\xa0(apartment) in large apartment blocks referred to as ‘', 'prédios', '’. These apartments often have a small veranda where people grow potted plants, hang their clothes to dry and keep their pets (usually birds). It is very common for those living in urban areas to visit their relatives residing in their rural ‘terra’ (homeland). Urban Portuguese tend to maintain strong ties to their hometowns or native regions by trying to visit as often as possible. Many of these visits are planned far in advance since the visitor usually stays for several days.', 'The Colonial Empire and Contemporary Political Changes', 'Exploration, ', 'colonisation', "" and political upheavals have characterised much of Portugal's history. In the 14th and 15th centuries, Portuguese colonists began to build an empire in far-flung regions visited by Portuguese explorers. The colonies of Portugal included Brazil, Mozambique, Angola, Guinea-Bissau, Cape Verde, Sao Tome, Principe, East Timor, Macau and Goa (a region in India). The Portuguese empire’s colonial expansion was pursued for various reasons: Spice trade, gold, resource extraction, the creation of overseas markets and to spread Catholicism. The empire lasted for over six centuries, ending when Macau was handed over to Mainland China in 1999."", 'The political developments that occurred in the country from the 20th century onwards are related to Portugal’s colonial history. From 1926 to 1974, Portugal was under a corporatist authoritarian dictatorship known as the ‘', 'Estado Novo', '’ (‘New State’), led by António de Oliveira Salazar until 1968. During the dictatorship, the country’s economy improved. Some believe that the economic progress of the country came at the expense of the suppression of political freedoms. For example, the state-imposed censorship and saw the congregation of more than three to four people in public as suspicious. Salazar also prioritised the role of the Catholic Church and its ideology, making the church one of the most powerful institutions in the country (see the ', 'Religion', ' section for more information).', 'During the last 13 years of Salazar’s rule, Portugal underwent various independence wars in their former African colonies of Mozambique, Angola, Campe Verde and Guinea-Bissau. The wars also saw many of Portugal’s younger generation being sent to the former colonies to fight. Today, it is common for Portuguese to have lost a loved one due to the wars or know of someone who suffered a loss, sensitive and sombre feelings are associated with this time.', 'In 1974, a socialist military group led by General António de Spínola took control of the government, marking the end of the nearly fifty-year-long dictatorship. This coup was aptly known as the ‘', 'Revolução dos Cravos', '’ (‘Revolution of the Carnations’) since Portuguese civilians placed carnations in the muzzles of rifles and uniforms of the military. The revolution was non-violent and saw little resistance from the dictatorship’s remaining loyal followers. Directly after the overthrow of the dictatorship, independence was granted to most of Portugal’s former colonies, marking the end of European colonialism in Africa.', 'The decolonisation process that occurred after the revolution had significant demographic and economic repercussions on Portugal. Over 500,000 Portuguese expats, some of whom were born abroad, returned to Portugal from the colonies. Known as ‘', 'retornados', ""’ (‘repatriates’), these repatriates filled Portugal's cities and towns, leading to high unemployment rates that continued into the next decade. In addition, locals from various colonies came to escape from the political turmoil that ensued in their countries. Nearly one million refugees settled in Portugal, most of whom were from Angola, fleeing from the civil war that came after decolonisation.1"", 'The end of the dictatorship also led to various political and social changes in the country. For example, literary and artistic production flourished after the state-imposed censorship was lifted. Moreover, the end of the 20th century saw the restoration of ', 'democracy', ' and the full withdrawal of the military from the political sphere, after several revisions of the constitution. Although Portugal is no longer politically connected to its former colonies, there are still economic, cultural and linguistic ties. The ‘Community of Portuguese-speaking Countries’ (formed in 1996) consists of nine member countries and serves to retain cultural connections between Portugal and the former colonies.2', 'Ethnicity, Homogeneity and Identity', 'Portugal’s ethnic composition is quite homogeneous, with most of the population being ethnically Portuguese. The country has seen an increase in ethnic diversity in the 21st century due to recent waves of immigrants from former colonies in Africa and Asia. This is particularly evident in the capital city of Lisbon and its surrounding metropolitan area. These populations tend to be residentially segregated in neighbourhoods with poorer housing conditions. However, for the most part, they are considered Portuguese, regardless of their place of origin.', 'Portugal’s official language – Portuguese – contributes to its national identity as well as the country’s relationship with its former colonies. Today, Portuguese is the first language of nearly the whole population and is the sixth most widely spoken language in the world. Many of the former colonies still speak it, such as Brazil, albeit with slight variation. Within Portugal, various regional accents can be heard throughout the mainland and in Portugal’s islands. Nonetheless, these regional differences are minor and rarely affect the quality of communication among the Portuguese. Ultimately, the Portuguese language provides an enduring source of national unity. Multilinguality is extremely common in Portugal, with many Portuguese having a grasp of Spanish, English and French.', 'Comparisons are often made between Portugal and neighbouring Spain. The two countries do share numerous affinities and cultural connections. However, it is important to acknowledge Portugal’s unique cultural identity by ensuring one does not categorise Portugal and the Portuguese people as ‘Spanish’, ‘Hispanic’ or ‘Latino’. Indeed, Portugal is quite different from Spain in various ways, and these distinctions often underpin ideas of the Portuguese identity. Some notable distinctions relate to Portugal’s cultural connection to the ocean, the Portuguese language, and a closer relationship with its former colonies.', 'Social Stratification', 'Economic and political changes throughout contemporary Portugal have impacted ', 'social stratification', ' and interactions. For the most part, Portugal is a hierarchical society and stratification tends to occur based on one’s education and economic status. Education is a core value, and it is common to find families who begin saving for their children’s tertiary education as soon as they are born. Homeownership is another indicator of one’s status. Indeed, parents will often help their children buy their first home.', 'One such way people have attempted to improve their economic conditions is through emigration. Large-scale emigration began during the second half of the 19th century and well into the 20th century. Many Portuguese have moved and continue to move abroad in hopes of better opportunities for themselves and their families. However, most maintain strong ties to their homeland, hoping to one day return and retire in Portugal.', 'Interactions and Outlook', 'At times, Portuguese may come across as somewhat reserved upon first meeting. Once they have become familiar with those around them, they are quite warm and hospitable. Among those they are close to, Portuguese communicate expressively and openly. Economic factors may play a large role in social interactions. There is an expectation that one will be modest and will avoid boasting about one’s wealth, putting oneself above others or dressing provocatively. Moreover, as Portugal is a collectivistic society, maintaining one’s reputation and dignity is considerably important to ensure one is respected as an individual as well as to protect the honour of one’s family.', 'Another factor that determines how Portuguese interact with one another is their propensity to avoid uncertainty. According to Hofstede Insights, Portugal scores high on the dimension of ', 'uncertainty avoidance', ' (score of 99).3 This indicates that the Portuguese have a general tendency to avoid uncertainty. Arguably, this is in part due to Portugal’s long-standing military dictatorship, whereby the country experienced a reasonable amount of stability and certainty in their day-to-day lives. The Portuguese tendency to avoid uncertainty is evident in the way in which many Portuguese carefully consider major changes before accepting them. One example is the following of traditions; people tend to uphold traditions they have followed throughout their lives and will usually consider if their actions will break a tradition.', 'Sebastianismo and Saudade', 'The concept of ‘', 'Sebastianismo', '’ reflects sentiments of hope, longing and sadness that many Portuguese people experience. The concept emerged from the death of Portugal’s former King Sebastian in Morocco in 1578. After his death, many of his subjects believed he would return to save them from Spanish rule, thus creating the messianic belief known as ‘', 'Sebastianismo', '’. At its core, Sebastianismo reflects a sense of hope that something desirable will come true while simultaneously feeling that it will never happen. For example, one may hope that they will achieve a job opportunity they applied for, yet feel that this is not fated for them.', 'An interrelated concept is ‘', 'saudade', '’, which refers to a combination of longing, nostalgia and melancholy. It reflects the desire for someone or something that is far away or unattainable, such as a loved one, one’s homeland or a distant memory. Portuguese may feel saudade when they are living abroad and feel homesick, or when they are separated from a loved one. The concept of saudade emerged during Portugal’s seafaring and exploration days; people would experience a strong feeling of longing for their loved ones and the Motherland. Artistic expression in Portugal fosters and thrives on saudade and Sebastianismo as a source of inspiration for artists, musicians and poets. One example is the lyrics composed for a ‘', 'fado', '’ – a popular urban song form that usually expresses a sense of sadness, regret and longing. The fado is played with the Portuguese guitar and is always a sombre occasion. Once a fado begins, no one is to talk, and in some instances clapping is inappropriate.', '_____________________', '1\xa0Encyclopaedia Britannica, 20182 See Comunidade dos Países de Língua Portuguesa, https://www.cplp.org/3 Hofstede Insights, 2018', '']"

Different regions were ruled or occupied by the Austro-Hungarian, Ottoman and Russian Empires at various times before they unified. Romanians are very proud of the fact that they held onto their land over a history of invasion. However, this has also produced cultural differentiations across the country.

The area’s long history under Austrian-Hungarian rule also means it has more visible Gothic architecture. Meanwhile, the Eastern regions have a closer proximity to Ukraine and Russia and show more influence from the Caucasus and Tatars. The south is home to the capital of Bucharest, which is the metropolitan centre of the country. Light-hearted competition between regions is common. For example, residents of the south may consider themselves to be the ‘real’ Romanians compared to other regions. Dialects do not vary drastically across these regions, but Romanians may be able to distinguish whereabouts one is from based on their accent.', 'Tradition and Folklore', 'The Romanian population has traditionally and historically been rural dwellers. However, the country experienced widespread industrialisation and urbanisation during the communist period. Today, more than half of the Romanian population (54.7%) lives in urbanised areas.1 Modern life has influenced a rise in cosmopolitanism in the cities. However, folk traditions and rural practices remain strong in certain parts of the country.

Some older ethnic Hungarians may not speak Romanian at all. The treatment of ethnic Hungarians in Romania remains a point of contention.6 Some have engaged in a struggle for equal recognition of their language rights. Ethnic Hungarians may also have a different view of their national belonging. Transylvania was part of Hungary until 1920 and Romania’s acquisition of this land can be a sensitive subject.

The huge country contains an incredible diversity of people, beliefs, values and lifestyles. These distinctions are particularly noticeable between the different regions and ethnicities. Most Russians live in developed and industrialised centres, with an estimated 74% of the population living in urban areas or cities.', '1', ' However, there are also large populations in rural towns and villages across the countryside. Due to the country’s massive size and long, complex history, any summary of Russia runs the risk of oversimplifying the culture. While the descriptions that follow are not intended to be indicative of every Russian person, there are common themes and principles that contribute to the values, attitudes, beliefs and ', 'norms', ' of the dominant society. Broadly speaking, generosity, resilience and strength tend to be common features of the Russian character across the country.', 'Context to Current Attitudes', 'Russia’s dominant and powerful position in global politics means that opinions of the country and its people are often formed before encountering them. For Australians, Russian culture is typically explained through a Western lens that sees it as an opposing force. Such descriptions commonly misunderstand the country’s history and motivating factors from the Russian perspective. When confronted with these assumptions from Westerners, Russians regularly find themselves in the position of loyally defending their country – somewhat reaffirming ideas of them as combative people. Interaction with Russians is likely to be smoother if one takes time to understand and appreciate the contexts from the Russian perspective. It is best not to critique Russia or President Vladimir Putin; while a Russian may agree with aspects of your argument, the comments may feel like another foreign criticism and be unwelcomed.', 'Russians generally have a very close emotional connection to their history as their recent past has been integral in shaping their nation and society today. To understand Russian people, one must appreciate that they have effectively survived two revolutions, two World Wars and a Civil War in the 20th century. They have also experienced significant socioeconomic and political upheaval in recent decades. A systemic socioeconomic breakdown in the 1990s impoverished many and affected people’s lifestyles as well as their visions for the future. A sense of melancholy and nostalgia may become noticeable in conversations when Russians discuss the past (or are reluctant to talk about it).', 'Ethnic Identities and National Unity', 'The immense size of Russia is a testament to an extraordinary history of conquest. However, it also reflects the challenges its society has faced to adequately provide for and unite such a sprawling and diverse group of people. Nearly 200 different ethnic groups and nationalities reside within Russian borders according to the 2010 census.', '2', ' Though most people are Slavic, many others have Turkic and Mongol heritage. Tatars, Ukrainians, Bashkirs, Chuvash and Chechens are some of the biggest ethnic minorities.', 'Many people from minority groups continue to hold their ethnic identity and cultural traditions close. They may speak languages or follow religions/customs that are specific to their people. Ethnic minorities are also often more collectivistic, showing strong loyalty and pride for their group. In some cases, people may have a stronger loyalty towards their ethnic identity than the Russian identity. However, this is not usually the case for ethnic Russians (', 'russkiye', ') who make up the majority of the population (77.7% as of 2010 est.). They generally see themselves as “100%” Russian (', 'rossiyanin', ') and may simply further define themselves by their region of birth.', 'The nationalism, solidarity and cultural identity shared between Russians of such diversity is highly complex and usually summarised through metaphors. Sometimes, Russians revert to simply leaving this fact unexplained, quoting a famous poet who said “you cannot understand Russia with your mind… you can only believe in it”.', '3', ' Others may refer to the idea and symbolism of a shared Russian ‘soul’ (', 'dusha', '). This explains the soul as the combination of one’s heart, mind and culture, and the uniting point making Russians a cohesive ‘people’ (', 'narod', ') despite their differences.', 'People commonly describe the soul of Russia as compassionate and generous. It’s also sometimes related to the country’s language or heritage in literature, dance, theatre, music and philosophy as Russia has a strong history of contribution to the arts. However, Russians arguably share the most in their collective history and experience of victories and defeats. It is said that people’s souls open up to each other through shared suffering and joy. In this way, misery can be endured so long as people can see that it is shared.', 'First Impressions and Interactions', 'Russians can come across as having quite a serious or stern front when initially meeting people they don’t know. They generally smile and emote very little in public. This is mostly because formal behaviour signifies respect, particularly when interacting with strangers or those who are older or of higher social status. As such, public behaviour is typically reserved and open complaint or anger is uncommon. People also generally put significant effort into their personal appearance whenever they leave the privacy of their home, presenting themselves very stylishly anytime they may have a potential interaction.', 'Once initial acquaintances have been made, Russians are likely to become more casual. They are often very honest about their opinions and keen to make them known. Russians can also be quite bold when approaching others, which can make them appear very forward to foreigners. For example, they may ask to join a table with strangers in preference to dining alone, offer advice to someone that did not ask for it, or ask for a favour. Russians tend to prefer people who are similarly direct.', 'Particularism and Rules', 'Russia is a particularistic society, meaning personal relations have more importance than rules, and individuals are valued for their unique personal importance. Members of particularist societies\xa0have a cultural tendency to trust anyone they know on the basis of familiarity. Meanwhile, they may show limited trust towards strangers until they have formed a personal relationship.\xa0This means Russians\xa0often have a strong compulsion to try and form personal relationships with strangers in order to build familiarity and, thus, trust in any social environment – be it private or professional.\xa0Showing camaraderie and willingness to bend the rules for someone builds trust and solidifies friendships. It is thought that being too cold and conscientious or law-abiding is ‘dry-ish’ (', 'sukhovatv', ') and to be completely dry (', 'sukhar', ') is to have no human touch at all.', 'As personal relationships are often considered more important than rules, they are sometimes interpreted rather as guidelines, particularly when exceptions for friends or family are needed. Regulations and plans have limited authority in Russia. While people appreciate rules and schedules, the reality is that they may not work or may be subject to change under unpredictable circumstances. This attitude is reflected in a common saying regarding traffic lights: “Green is for everyone. Red is for me.” This way of thinking sees oneself as the ‘exception’ to the rule; the signal for everyone else to stop is still an opportunity to go. It reflects the particularist, in-group mentality of Russian culture as well as its light disregard for law and order.', 'Interdependence and ‘Blat’', ""Family and close friends play an important role in Russian's lives, reflecting the collectivistic nature of the culture. Vast social networks are crucial to getting things done. Under the promise of friendship, people perform favours for one another, from old school friends to former neighbours. Some examples include helping a person get introduced, obtain information, access authority or navigate around the "", 'bureaucracy', '. This personal networking is known as ‘', 'blat', '’', '4', ' - ‘favours of access’. Long-term personal relationships play a central role in advancing group interests and individuals’ prospects, creating opportunity, security and facilitating social mobility. Blat/favours can also be motivated by social or financial gain, especially when a person needs personal networks to get past red-tape. For example, if a parent wants to get their child into a good university and they know someone on the board, they may ask for a favour ""for old friendship\'s sake"" whilst also giving a ""gift"" to the person for their troubles.', 'While this is beneficial, friendships in Russia are not purely pursued for what people can get out of them; most are deeply personal, authentic and trusting. The continuity of these friendships is visible in the way people do not expect an immediate reciprocation of favours. Instead, a return favour is usually performed at a later time (perhaps even years later) when it is really needed. If asked if they would like something done in return, one may say, “We are people of one circle. We will square accounts later”. Ultimately, though it may occur in both private and professional contexts, the social networking dynamics of blat are very personal in nature.', 'This ', 'interdependence', ' has been largely driven by necessity, as the government cannot always be relied upon to provide support. However, it also relates to a longstanding mentality of survival in Russian culture. These exchanges usually take place because they’re vitally important or related to a desperate matter. The degree to which people rely on one another varies significantly depending on where they live, their wealth and age. Generally, isolated villages or towns in rural areas are more collectivistic as they may not have access to certain provisions. In some towns, the whole neighbourhood may be deeply involved in helping everyone collectively meet everyday challenges. Generosity and camaraderie have remained strong features of the Russian character even after the economic crisis swept the nation. Many in difficult financial circumstances will still look to assist those around them with what they can afford, despite having to think more about attending to their own immediate, individualistic needs.', 'Status and Humility', 'Power is heavily centralised in Russia and there is a big disparity of resources between those with authority and the people that depend on them. These differentiations of power have led to an increased emphasis on status symbols. As such, those in the lower socioeconomic bracket often save to buy luxury items (such as technology, clothes or cars) to show signs of success. However, despite this focus on appearances, there are not obvious class distinctions among general society. Generally, the only social identifier that can somewhat indicate a person’s wealth or status is their place of birth.', 'Humility is essential to interaction in Russia. People are expected to understate personal achievements, contributions and capacities and talk modestly (as most survive on a modest standard of living). The exception to this is when one is talking about their own child, in which case it is socially appropriate to boast of the child’s success. However, generally people show humility to avoid jealousy or the appearance of gloating at those who are struggling. Russians who are in fortunate circumstances commonly minimise their wealth or well-being. For example, the response to “How are you?” may be “normal” or “so-so” even when things are at their best. This can also avoid negative opinions in Russia, as there is still a cultural tendency to somewhat resent the success of others and perhaps be sceptical of it. Those who are single-handedly wealthy are sometimes presumed to have made their money through fraudulent means.', 'Vulnerability and Instability', ""Russia has a history and geography that seems to support the notion that its people have constantly been in a position of defence, whether it's been out of vulnerability to being wiped out by the cold weather or an invading force. For example, the country has very few natural defences (i.e. mountain ranges) to protect it from attack. This means that its history of conquest and expansion has been seen by the Russian people as a necessary protection against invasion."", 'A consistent feeling of vulnerability and uncertainty has persisted due to other political situations as well. With the collapse of the Soviet Union in the 1990s, the country suffered a total systemic upheaval that impoverished many. Such fundamental change following an era of communism (under which people had lived in consistent and predictable conditions their whole life) deeply rocked Russian society. The transition to a competitive market economy was deeply challenging for some, significantly more so for those in villages and towns. Today, many Russians who can earn enough to meet their needs still feel profoundly insecure and have a reduced sense of social mobility. The Levada Centre found 65% of Russians aged between 18 and 24 don’t plan their lives further than two years ahead (2016). In 2015, 46% of respondents to a poll expressed that they couldn’t plan their future because they did not know what would happen to them even in the next few months.', '5', 'From recognising the precarious situations Russians have endured historically, it can be understood why the culture has such a strong avoidance of uncertainty.', '6', ' Russians highly value stability and security. As Geert Hofstede has said, “[they] feel very much threatened by ambiguous situations”, an attitude reaffirmed by their recent history. People are more comfortable with assured stability and tend to approach situations with scepticism and caution rather than taking risks. Ultimately, the culture tends to be conservative and particularly reluctant towards change.', 'Changes Since the 1990s', 'Russian culture is traditionally quite collectivistic and inclusive; however, in the last 10 years, there has been a noticeable rise in ', 'materialism', ' and ', 'individualism', '. This is most visible in the bigger cities, such as Moscow and St. Petersburg. Generally, the primary aspiration of Russians across all demographics is to secure stable jobs and futures to see their children be more prosperous and successful than themselves.', 'Cultural shifts towards ', 'individualism', ' have been easier for the educated and urbanised populations to adopt, and many people are enjoying newfound success in the large middle class. Those raised in the post-socialist period often have different attitudes from Russians who lived through the Soviet era. This generational divide is commonly seen in a tendency towards optimism among younger generations. They often are more hopeful regarding the future and flexible about adopting foreign approaches. Many youth are growing impatient with public conservatism and nationalism. This contrasts with some members of the older generation who have struggled to adjust and generally hold a more pessimistic and fatalistic perspective. Having experienced a time whereby the state was responsible for them and determined their well-being, they may feel a reduced sense of control over their lives and be resigned to the idea that it is out of their hands.', 'Finally, it is important to appreciate that some Russians may view the difficulty experienced during the 1990s as more socially damaging than the communist regime. The Soviet Union is often associated with stability. Older Russians may feel nostalgia for a simpler, more predictable time when they were young, whereas younger Russians may be influenced by a popular national rhetoric that glorifies the communist era and emphasises Russia’s victories and status as a global superpower at the time. While every Russian family is likely to have their own personal opinions and stories about what life under communism was really like, these personal anecdotes are now coupled with those of their own about the difficulty of “living through the ’90s”. Indeed, these recent experiences are more relevant to current attitudes; for young Russians, the Soviet times hold little context for them outside of history and their own family’s personal stories.', '_____________________', '1\xa0Central Intelligence Agency, 2020', '2 Central Intelligence Agency, 2020', '3\xa0Fyodor Tyutchev, 1866', '4\xa0“Blat” also has a second meaning in Russian that alludes to corruption/criminal activity.

Moreover, key events from history have influenced the national identity of Serbians. Such events include the Ottoman Empire’s occupation of Serbia, the formation of Yugoslavia and Serbia’s attainment of national independence. Many Serbian customs and traditions are often linked to these significant events from the past. Contemporary Serbia draws inspiration from around the world while paying homage to the past.', 'Ethnic Interactions', 'Within Serbia, the majority of the population identify as ethnically Serb (83.3%). Serbian ethnic identity is often not exclusively defined by place of birth. Indeed, people who identify as Serb may have been born in Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina or elsewhere. The second largest ethnic group is Hungarians (3.5%), most of whom live near the Serbian-Hungarian border in the northern province of Vojvodina. The culture in Vojvodina is partly influenced by Hungary.

However, when the topic of politics and political history arise, interactions may become tense. Nationalism towards one’s country and ', 'ethnicity', ' tends to be stronger among expats than those in Serbia. Some people who identify with an ethnic group may try to avoid interactions with other groups to prevent potential unpleasant contact or evoking past memories. Serbians also have a long history of interaction with Montenegro, a country located to the southwest of Serbia. The two countries were in a state union up until 2006. Relations between Serbs and Montenegrins are generally harmonious.', 'Yugoslav Wars', 'In the post-WWII period, Serbia was a republic governed under the unified communist state of Yugoslavia, led by Josip Broz Tito. Serbia was integral to Yugoslavia as Belgrade (the current capital of Serbia) was the capital city of the federation. In 1991, Croatia, Slovenia and Macedonia declared independence, followed by Bosnia in 1992; the remaining republics of Serbia and Montenegro declared the new Republic of Yugoslavia in 1992. Meanwhile, former Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic sought to unite ethnic Serbs in neighbouring countries and claim their territories as part of a “Greater Serbia”. This goal was fuelled by a nationalist rhetoric and led to a number of conflicts whereby all sides suffered considerable loss and damage.', 'Over the course of these events, the population of Serbs in Serbia grew significantly due to the influx of Serb refugees from primarily Croatia and Bosnia. While the physical damage from the wars was sparse (with the exception of air raids by NATO during the Kosovo war in 1999), the country suffered economically due to an embargo imposed by Western countries. Many Serbians attribute Serbia’s current economic struggles to the West, which creates a still-prevalent sense of bitterness. This feeling also stems from the belief by many Serbians that the Western media presented negative and inaccurate coverage of the conflict. Moreover, many Serbs feel as though they have been wrongly blamed for the wars that occurred throughout the Balkan region.', 'For many Serbs, there is much sorrow and anger that runs deep into the memories of many generations, thus making the process of reconciliation complex. Many Serbs fled Serbia in fear of military conscription while others sought a more financially secure life. Displacement and separation between family members were common.', 'There is a generational divide when it comes to the experiences and feelings towards the Yugoslav Wars. Those who were mature during the war find it difficult to speak about the conflicts and particularly Croats and Bosniaks. When discussions about these ethnic tensions do arise, it may evoke emotions of sorrow, grief and/or anger. The older generation passed on their experiences of the conflict to subsequent generations, along with historical legends about the struggles in creating the Serbian nation. Thus, many of the younger generations feel strongly about the conflicts and tensions, while others may speak about it more openly in hopes of reconciliation.', 'Serbs are more likely than the other groups in the region to identify themselves as Yugoslav. This is largely due to the belief that during Tito’s regime when Yugoslavia was unified, Serbia was flourishing economically and the standard of living was higher than it is now. For many, there is a sense of nostalgia towards the greatness of Serbia during the Yugoslav years.', 'Identity and Pride', 'Although not often spoken aloud, the national slogan ‘', 'samo sloga Srbina\xa0spasava', '’ (‘only unity saves the Serbs’) reflects the common attitude that solidarity is necessary in order to survive. This attitude stems from Serbia’s history of upheavals, including the Yugoslav Wars. It also reflects the collectivist nature of society, whereby people tend to be extremely loyal towards their friends and family.', 'The various historical events that have occurred in Serbia have contributed to the sense of national pride. For example, most Serbs are familiar with the role Prince Lazar played in the battle between Christian and Ottoman forces in 1389. The battle stands as a symbol of the national suffering of the Serbs and is often considered one of the pillars on which the Serbian national identity was created. Such events and myths are passed down from previous generations and are often seen as a core part of the Serbian identity. This was amplified by artists that fled abroad to escape the conflicts. Many of these artists portrayed Serbian culture in a more nationalist light by recalling these national myths.', 'The correlation between ', 'ethnicity', ' and religious affiliation also plays a central role in the Serbian identity. The national slogan is symbolised as four large C letters in each quarter of a Serbian Orthodox crucifix. This symbol is widely seen throughout Serbia and in other Serb-populated areas of former Yugoslavia, often in the form of graffiti. A connection between Serbian identity and religion is also reinforced by language.The Serbian language is distinct as it is typically written in the Cyrillic alphabet. This occurred largely through religious liturgy, which is where the written language of Serbia emerged from. For many individuals, the Serbian Orthodox faith and language distinguishes Serbia from its neighbours.', 'Humour and ‘Inat’', 'Humour is a common part of the Serbian demeanour.\xa0‘', 'Inat', '’ refers to a combination of stubbornness and defiance and is often expressed in humour. Many Serbians consider it to be a good trait that reflects one’s strength in the face of overwhelming odds. One example of inat is when Belgrade residents responded to the violent tactics used in NATO’s intervention in 1999 by holding rock concerts and wearing shirts displaying target symbols on their backs.', 'Dark humour and aphorisms are also popular throughout Serbia. An aphorism usually consists of one or two short and sharp sentences that describe in direct and often blunt terms a truth on some common social matter or state of mind. In recent times, this form of humour has assisted the country through the transition after the war. An example is by Serbian writer Rastko Zakic, who wrote during the Yugoslav Wars, “We will do our best not to have any more fratricide. We will stop being brothers”.']"

It borders the North Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea, occupying roughly 85% of the Iberian Peninsula. Each region/state of Spain has a unique cultural identity that residents are very proud of. One finds that many of the things thought of as distinctively ‘Spanish’ often have a local or regional origin. For example, the flamenco style of music and dance originated in Andalucía (southern Spain). Despite the diversity of Spanish culture, the country also has a strong and unifying national identity. The culture is famous for having a strong social dimension, with many ', 'fiestas', ' (celebrations) punctuating the year. Spaniards are renowned for being proud people with a deep love of Spain and a strong awareness of their personal honour. Their open and lively communication style often gives foreigners the impression that they are confident and enthusiastic people.', 'Regionalism (Regionalismo)', 'Spain is most densely populated along the Mediterranean and Atlantic coasts, as well as in the major inland cities of Madrid, Sevilla and Zaragoza. There has been a consistent pattern of migration from rural areas to industrial cities over the past century. Today, only roughly 18% of the population lives rurally.1 Some Spaniards identify a cultural difference between rural and urban dwellers, with the former being more religious and socially conservative. Those living in smaller towns and villages also tend to enjoy a slower pace of life. Meanwhile, the major cities are densely populated and quite loud.', '', 'Cultural differences are also very noticeable between the regions of Spain. Spain contains a number of different historical provinces and localities, each with its own distinct identity, cultural practices, and traditions. For example, some regions have their own language, cuisine and literature that have developed through history. In appreciation of these provincial identities, Spain is split into 17 different regions, known as autonomous communities (', 'comunidades autonomas', '). Each follows the constitutional law of Spain but has a degree of self-governance to make regionally specific laws. One may hear people speak of “', 'Las Españas', '” (the Spains) in reference to this system. The powers of the autonomous communities vary considerably. For example, the Basque Country, Catalonia and Galicia are recognised as having a “historic nationality” that grants them special status and extensive powers. There has also been a historical Moorish influence in Spain due to its close proximity to Morocco. Generally, this cultural influence becomes more visible the further south one travels, with Islamic architecture still visible in many places.', '', 'National Identity and Language', 'The topic of national identity is a sensitive subject in Spain, as there are large points of difference within the country. For example, an index measuring Europeans’ attachment to their region, local area and country found that Spain had the most internal variation in Europe.2 The country is home to some of the most nationalistic regions (such as Madrid) where national loyalty and pride are very strong. However, Spain also has some of the most regionalist provinces in Europe (e.g. the Basque Country and Catalonia). In these places, loyalty and affiliation to one’s local identity are more important than the national identity for many people.', '', 'Language is deeply linked to identity in Spain as it is one of the most apparent indicators as to which region people live in. Many Spaniards speak a local dialect at home or in daily life and business. These are generally people who live in regions with very strong provincial identities, such as Catalonia, the Basque Country, Galicia, Valencia and the Balearic Islands. It is estimated that between 11% and 28% of the population speak a local language as their first language.3,4 While the exact figure is still undetermined, the number of Spaniards speaking local languages is at least many million.', '', 'Nonetheless, the majority of Spaniards speak Spanish (', 'Castilian', '), and almost all citizens who have a local language are bilingual in Spanish to some degree.

Catalonia is one of Spain’s most distinctive autonomous communities. According to statistics from the Government of Catalonia, roughly 80% of the region’s population can speak Catalan, with approximately 36.3% speaking it as their primary language.5', '', 'Local nationalism is strong in Catalonia. For example, it is more common to see the regional flag flown in public than the national flag. A sizable proportion of the population claims to feel ‘Catalonian, not Spanish’. There has been an ongoing political debate as to whether the region should secede from Spain to be an independent state. In 2017, the regional government held a referendum on the matter in which less than half of the population participated, but 90% of participants voted for independence. Upon this result, the Catalonian government declared independence, which was deemed illegal by the constitutional court. This event led to mass protests and political upheaval.', '', 'Ultimately, the Catalan bid for independence has become the biggest political challenge facing the country in decades. The developments have divided public opinion both within Catalonia and Spain more broadly. The push for regional independence has also driven some Castilian-speaking Spaniards to be more loyal to the nation-state in order to promote unity.

Over this period, ', 'democratic', ' institutions were inhibited, freedom of the press was controlled, and political dissent was suppressed.', '', 'Franco sought to build a unified vision of the Spanish national identity. He promoted the power of the monarchy and Catholic Church, seeing these as foundations of the country. However, his rule also suppressed cultural diversity across different regions of Spain. Many regional customs and local languages were censored. The traditions that were chosen to be representative of the homogeneous national identity were largely left to the government’s discretion. For example, flamenco was promoted as a long-standing ‘Spanish’ tradition, despite its origins being primarily affiliated with the Gitanos of Andalusia in southern Spain. The official statuses of regional languages were revoked, meaning the use of Spanish was enforced in all government, legal and commercial settings – despite millions of Spaniards speaking local languages.', '', ""There is still a lot of contention over the facts surrounding this time in history as different narratives of events continue to circulate. Overall, it is not socially acceptable to be an open Franco ‘supporter’ or ‘sympathiser’. However, one cannot generalise Spaniards’ individual opinions on the dictatorship. As of 2022, roughly 58% of Spaniards were born after Franco’s death (aged 0-49 years ), and a further 22% were 16 years or younger during his rule.6 Therefore, most Spaniards have only known a ‘post-Franco' Spain, which experienced a quick "", 'secular', ' and ', 'democratic', ' transformation after his death. The social effects of Franco’s regime are still noticeable as the injustices of his rule continue to be felt by the older generation and the families of those he persecuted.', '', 'However, today the era of Francoist Spain is thought of more as a point of reference. Social and political decisions continue to be compared and measured against those of the regime, and there is commonly major pushback against ideas that appear to be affiliated with his vision for Spain. Many people feel sceptical or uncomfortable with patriotism, unable to detach it from the devastating effects of Franco’s nationalist dictatorship. Therefore, overt signs of national pride in Spain (such as having the national flag in your house) may make people think you are a Franco supporter. It is more common for people to be proud of Spain for its culture and people, rather than its politics.', '', 'Instability and Change', 'According to Geert Hofstede’s dimensions, there is a strong tendency to avoid uncertainty in Spanish culture. People prioritise permanent solutions over those options that are risky or more ambiguous. This is unsurprising considering that almost every Spaniard was heavily affected by the Global Financial Crisis. The country went into recession in 2008, and the unemployment rate peaked at over 25% in 2013.7 Almost everyone knows someone who either lost their job or has been out of work for years. Conditions have improved a lot, and there is less paranoia surrounding economic insecurity than there was five years ago.

Spaniards often love to support the underdog. Many folk stories follow the adventures of low-class outsiders, such as bandits, who can beat the system of a corrupt society. In reality, very few Spaniards are likely to be pleased if they are the target of a pickpocketer. However, these stories reflect the general scepticism of government systems and mistrust of authority figures. This attitude can encourage spontaneity and a light disregard for law and order in daily life (i.e. getting out of a car stopped at a traffic light).', '', 'Organisation of the Day', 'One of the most stark cultural differences between Spain and the English-speaking West is the organisation of the day. Spain has some of the longest working hours in Europe – from 9 am to 8 pm with a two- or three-hour break in the afternoon (roughly 2 pm to 5 pm). This break is traditionally for a siesta (nap) between jobs that have become ingrained in the culture. The custom of the siesta has developed a stereotype of Spaniards as slow-paced, laid-back people. However, the majority of Spaniards (58%) do not actually nap during these hours. In some parts of Spain, such as rural towns, the streets may still fall quiet to allow people to sleep indoors. However, many people do not have the ability to commute home for a nap and choose to socialise at restaurants and bars instead.15', '', 'Due to how late the working day finishes, there is a very big late-night culture in Spain. Shopping centres and convenience stores are often open until 10 pm, meaning there is a continual bustle in towns and cities later into the night. Meanwhile, most restaurants will only open up for dinner at about 9 pm. Dinner ', '(la cena)', ' is rarely eaten before this time, or usually even later on weekends. Therefore, people normally go to bed around or after midnight, including many children. Indeed, Spaniards have the latest bedtimes in Europe.16\xa0There is currently a national debate as to whether these working hours are still suited to modern Spanish life. With fewer people actually sleeping during the hours of siesta, longer hours of work and late evenings, many Spaniards are sleep deprived. Nevertheless, the organisation of the day and late-night hours allow people to fit in time to see one another.', '', 'Socialising and Public Spaces', 'Spanish culture has a deep social dimension. It is considered normal for people to stay up late talking with friends after a meal, sometimes into the early hours of the morning (a period of time known as ', '‘la sobremesa’).', ' People who do not engage with this aspect of the culture may feel a slight social barrier with Spaniards, as they often bond and build closer friendships over these late-night conversations. Colleagues and friends also often meet during siesta hours and talk over a small beer (caña) to pass the time.', '', 'Public spaces play a large role in Spaniards’ social life. Plazas (public squares) provide a place for people to mingle without having to necessarily plan an occasion, and most towns and suburbs of major cities generally have restaurants, cafes and bars within walking distance. These popular places provide Spaniards the opportunity to see the public, catch up with friends and hear the latest news. As most socialisation tends to occur outside of people’s homes, people can get to know many of the locals in their suburb or town, reinforcing a sense of community belonging. For example, elderly people may be able to maintain a healthy social life simply by sitting at cafes on popular streets, watching locals and waiting to be spoken to by those passing by.', '', 'Communication and Interaction', 'The Spanish are generally observed as being quite informal people. It is common to move on to a first-name basis quickly after meeting someone. Once close acquaintance has been made, Spaniards are generally quite candid and outwardly emotional in comparison to other cultures. This can give people from more reserved cultures the impression that they are very confident people. They tend to be very honest about their opinions and encourage the free flow of ideas. Open expressions of anger, sadness and affection are generally acceptable unless there is a feeling that the situation is going to escalate. For example, people may have discussions that appear heated due to raised voices. However, in most cases, these emotional conversations are lighthearted, and the tone of the speaker’s voice is simply an indication of their conviction, sincerity or passion.', '', 'Many Spaniards cannot bear to cut a conversation short. It is common and acceptable for friends to interrupt and talk over one another as people get excited about the conversation. In 1983, Pope John Paul II famously said, “The Pope would like to speak too” (', 'El Papa tambien quiere hablar', ') as he tried to be heard over the rabble of a Spanish crowd. Spaniards are not particularly comfortable with silence in social situations.

The country shares borders with Finland, Denmark and Norway. Sweden has been inhabited for nearly 5,000 years since it was first settled by several Germanic tribes. The country remained relatively ethnically homogeneous throughout its history until the recent waves of immigration transformed it into a multi-ethnic society. Contemporary Sweden prides itself on championing human rights and equality, as manifested in its social welfare system. Additionally, concepts such as ‘', 'lagom', '’ (‘the middle way’) and modesty are cornerstones of Swedish culture. These ideas influence the country’s cuisine, architecture and even communication styles.', 'Geography and the Environment', 'Sweden is traditionally divided into three distinct regions: Norrland (northern Sweden), Svealand (central Sweden) and Götaland (southern Sweden). The vast majority of people live in Stockholm, Gothenburg or Malmö, three major cities that form a triangle of urban residence in Götaland.More than four-fifths of the population lives in urban centres. The largest city, Stockholm, is the capital as well as the political, economic and cultural hub of the country.', 'Geographically, Sweden has a diverse set of landscapes and climates. Access to nature is protected by a law known as ‘', 'allenmansrätten', '’ (meaning ‘the right of common access to land’). This law applies to all fields, forests, lakes and beaches across the country. Allenmansrätten makes it permissible for anyone to camp and walk on almost all private property. The diversity of Sweden’s landscapes and allenmansrätten has helped foster a love and appreciation of nature among Swedes. One example of Sweden’s appreciation for the outdoors is the popular sport of orienteering, in which one explores nature while finding predetermined checkpoints.', 'The change of seasons and differences in daylight have a significant impact on people’s lifestyle and their ability to enjoy the outdoors. In the winter months, people experience little to no sunlight and the weather is often bitter and difficult to cope with for a long duration. During summer months, the sun is visible for most of the day and into the night. Thus, many people work long hours in the winter to be able to take a holiday during summer and enjoy the daylight and nature. Some Swedes can feel burnt out once they reach the summer months due to their tough experiences in winter. These seasonal extremes contribute to Swedes’ deep appreciation for nature and sunlight.', 'Ethnic Composition and Social Changes', 'The Swedish government does not collect statistics on ', 'ethnicity', ' in Sweden but rather categorises citizens by country of birth. Historically, the population was vastly homogeneous, mostly made up of ethnic Swedes, and people from other Nordic countries such as Finland and Denmark. Today, it is estimated that 5% of the population is Finnish, and a little less than 1% is Danish.1 There is also a small indigenous minority, known as the Sami, who typically live in northern Sweden. The Sami make up less than 0.3% of the population.', ""Sweden's ethnic composition has changed dramatically in recent decades. This is due to the large waves of international immigration that the country has received. Sweden has generally been welcoming towards refugees and committed to family reunification on a national level. Indeed, the country has accepted more refugees per capita than any other European nation. However, the government has shifted to stricter immigration restrictions as the mass influx of migrants has strained resources and altered public opinion."", ""The unprecedented number of newcomers has challenged Sweden economically and culturally. Rapid changes in the country have also caused some divides among the population regarding opinions about refugees and immigrants. Some citizens in Sweden strongly oppose allowing more immigrants and refugees into the country, while others are supportive. For example, one poll found that 41% of Swedes thought that the country should grant fewer residency permits to refugees.2 It is important to approach the topic about changes to Sweden's ethnic composition with sensitivity."", 'Swedish Identity', 'For many Swedes, the main defining features of contemporary Sweden are modesty, equality and respect for universal human rights. While this perception of the Swedish identity persists, rapid changes in the country’s ethnic composition are influencing some people’s attitudes. With the large increase in immigrants, the notion of what it means to be Swedish has shifted from an ', 'ethnicity', '-based definition to a more nationality-based definition.', 'Some people express a distinction between ‘', 'svenskar', '’ (Swedes) and ‘', 'invandrare', '’ (immigrants). This distinction is usually linked to physical appearance, cultural affiliation and socioeconomic class. For example, the distinction between svenskar-invandrare is most visible in particular suburban and rural areas where large groups of immigrants and refugees inhabit older and lower-quality buildings. Such suburbs are sometimes characterised as being disorderly or unsafe with high levels of unemployment. However, by global standards, the most notorious of these suburbs have relatively low poverty and crime rates.', 'Socially conscientious citizens tend to avoid the svenskar-invandrare dichotomy, and the Swedish legal system makes no distinction. Indeed, most Swedes are sensitive to ethnic stereotyping and avoid making assumptions about people based on their ', 'ethnicity', '. The phrase ‘', 'åsikskorridor', '’ (literally ‘opinion corridor’) refers to the views or opinions that people are expected not to go against. For example, most people oppose discrimination on the basis of gender, ', 'ethnicity', ', sexual orientation, age or ability. Indeed, most Swedes view putting any member of society down as unacceptable. In sum, many Swedes believe that the Swedish identity is based on shared core values and attitudes.', 'Social Structure and Egalitarianism', 'According to Hofstede Insights, Sweden is a ‘feminine society’ in which balance, inclusivity and consideration for others are core components of the social structure.3 The notion of ‘', 'folkhemmet', ""’ (‘the people's home') is a metaphor for the nation of Sweden as a family household. This idea symbolises social "", 'democratic', "" ideals of equality and mutual care, which form the foundation for a society mediated and supported by social welfare. The process of developing Sweden into a folkhemmet can be traced back to the end of the WWII period. During this time, there were major reforms adopted to supply the population with pensions, allowances, insurance and the expansion of tertiary education and research. In turn, an extensive social welfare system was established, which continues to provide for most of the population's health, education and retirement needs."", ""Today, distribution of resources in Sweden is among the most equal in the world. The welfare system in Sweden is sometimes described as ‘cradle to coffin', whereby support is available at each stage of one's life cycle. To sustain this welfare system, Sweden has a high tax rate. There is a general view that Swedes work hard to allow every citizen to be able to obtain the same welfare rights. Moreover, many Swedes are willing to pay high tax rates due to the returns they gain in strong public institutions (such as healthcare and education). Many gain a sense of pride from paying their taxes as it makes them feel that they are contributing to Sweden."", 'The welfare system in Sweden has paved the way for a more egalitarian society. Indeed, many of the traditional markers of socioeconomic class affiliation have faded over the last 50 years. The standard of living in Sweden is high. Although unemployment rates are beginning to rise with the increase in immigrants, unemployment is less pervasive in Sweden comparative to the rest of the world.', '‘Lagom’ and Modesty', 'The concept of ‘', 'lagom', ""’ has no English equivalent. Nonetheless, it can generally be described as ‘the middle way' or ‘moderation'. Lagom is reflected in the Swedish proverb “Lagom är bäst”, which translates as “Enough is as good as a feast” or “The right amount is best”. Lagom is underpinned by the idea of contentment or a sense that things are sufficient just as they are. It is reflected in all aspects of Swedish life through ideas such as equality and moderation. For example, the intention behind Sweden's welfare system is to ensure that everyone has enough, and nobody goes without. Lagom is also reflected in the functionality of Swedish architecture and design, respect for natural resources and the simplicity of Swedish cuisine."", ""Some describe lagom as a ‘risk-aversive logic'. Indeed, doing something in a ‘lagom way' means not taking many risks, not overindulging or not standing out from the crowd. Arguably, lagom is most visible in the preferences of Swedes and the way they present themselves. Excessive behaviour, flashiness or boasting are frowned upon. Indeed, bragging ("", 'skryta', ') is one of the biggest taboos in Sweden. Some Swedish youth do not necessarily uphold lagom, as it tends to be a more traditional element of Swedish culture.', 'A concept intertwined with lagom is ‘', 'Jantelagen', '’ (‘the law of Jante’). Jantelagen can be thought of as a Nordic version of ‘', 'tall poppy syndrome', '’. Maintaining modesty and humility is at the core of Jantelagen. Typically, people will avoid skryta. However, the concept of Jantelagen extends further to say that no one is more special than anyone else. Thus, Swedes may frown upon those who want to be noticed or considered special, due to social ', 'norms', "" regarding Jantelagen. Some Swedes dislike lagom owing to the Jantelagen aspect. Indeed, some may wish to speak highly of their accomplishments. One's intention for standing out is important, as Swedes are more likely to be displeased with boasting if it is purely for attention or to be seen as better than those around them."", 'Privacy and Demeanour', ""Swedes may come across as somewhat reserved or serious at times, as friendships often take time to develop. For foreigners, this demeanour can come across as aloof or distant. However, for many Swedes, personal distance is maintained out of respect and consideration for other people's personal space. Thus, an individual's privacy is highly respected. The reserved demeanour of Swedes is more common in large cities than in rural areas of the country."", ""Respect for privacy is important in public spaces; people will often keep their voices low, maintain an arm's length of distance and minimise physical contact. Swedes may avoid approaching people they do not know unless they have a specific reason to. For example, they may not begin a conversation with a service provider in a store, nor sit next to a stranger on a train unless it is crowded. However, the value of privacy is not limited to physical space. People tend not to divulge a lot of personal information about themselves when first meeting others. Swedes are also unlikely to wish to discuss their personal views with those they are not close to. This demeanour greatly relaxes once one begins to develop a relationship with a Swede."", 'Swedes also tend to be very considerate of those around them and will make an effort to do their part to help others remain comfortable.

That being said, many customs and social expectations vary between nations.', 'Cultural differences between England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are most visible in each country’s individual history and heritage, as well as regional dialects and accents. There are also variations in the way each national identity within the UK is perceived. For example, Scottish, Welsh and Irish people tend to be more aware of a dual identity (e.g. being both Scottish and British). The English, on the other hand, generally do not feel the same need to distinguish their origin – as ‘', 'British', '’ is often assumed to be synonymous with ‘', 'English', '’. This predominance of the English identity can be a point of tension or resentment. Indeed, England is the significantly more populous country, with approximately 84% of the UK’s population living there.1 All four countries are influenced by the size, popularity and political decision-making power of London, which is the cultural and economic hub of the UK.', 'The UK has also become increasingly ', 'multicultural', ' with the increase of immigration over the past two decades. In 2019, it was estimated approximately 9.5 million people living in the UK (or 14% of the population) were born abroad.2 London has the largest number of migrants among all regions of the UK, home to over 3 million foreign-born residents (35% of the UK’s total foreign-born population).3 Some of the largest migrant and second-generation migrant populations have arrived from former British colonies (such as India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Jamaica). There are also significant populations of people born in Poland, Romania, the Republic of Ireland and Germany. Such migration has introduced a diversity of cultural customs and traditions to most major cities, visible in the varieties of foods, places of worship, music and arts.', 'Further cultural differences in the UK can often be found between those who live in the major cities and those who live in the countryside. The British can often quickly detect which county a person is from by their accent alone, and may sometimes be able to pinpoint their town of upbringing just from their speech. This easy identification of people’s backgrounds can cause the British to pigeonhole and stereotype each other quite quickly, sometimes hindering social mobility. This is especially true for those with accents that acutely reflect a class stereotype. For example, ‘posh’ pronunciations can reveal that a person was raised in a wealthy family and went to a private school, whilst a regional accent (e.g. cockney) may be associated with the working-class.', 'The Class System', 'The British class system has historically been a powerful point of stratification in the social, economic and political spheres of life. Differentiations between the working class and middle class were once largely defined by the occupations people had (e.g. ', 'blue collar', ' workers vs. ', 'white collar', ' workers). However, today class differences generally have more to do with one’s schooling, social orientations and upbringing. The majority of the UK is now often considered to be ‘middle class’, a distinction often expanded to include all that live relatively comfortably and have a secondary or tertiary education. Though British society has progressively become somewhat less class conscious, the class system remains integral and continues to shape the people’s sense of belonging. For example, many working class British may wear their class status as a badge of honour that engenders a sense of solidarity with others. Furthermore, the elite or aristocracy of British society (usually inheritors of old money or land) may be viewed with suspicion and/or resentment.', 'Despite social stratifications between classes, there is a strong egalitarian belief that everyone should have equal opportunity to better their circumstances regardless of their background. This also translates into a respect for order or ‘fair play’, whereby people should be rewarded on the basis of their work ethic rather than privilege. Furthermore, bragging or boasting about one’s status is not appreciated and often met with ridicule (a phenomenon known as ‘', 'tall poppy syndrome', '’). Thus, people from the upper classes will usually refrain from talking of their privilege in overt ways.', 'Stoicism and Reservedness', 'The British have earned a reputation for remaining stoic and maintaining a ‘stiff upper lip’ through tough times. This has been largely shaped by the hardships faced during the First and Second World Wars, as well as the post-war period. There is a strong notion that the British nation and society has been built upon generations of hard work and social progress. In turn, many people pride themselves on their capacity to ‘grin and bear it’ whilst being diligent and respectable, as is exemplified in the slogan “keep calm and carry on”.', 'The British also generally tend to be more reserved about exhibiting emotions in public, preferring to air negative opinions or impressions in private company (or deliver them politely). While many readily voice political frustrations through organised demonstrations or other major public events, speaking out of terms, complaining or strong dissent amongst one’s peers can be seen as unnecessary fuss. Many, especially among the older generation, exhibit a preference toward ‘minding one’s own business’.', 'Humour', 'Humour is an important aspect of British culture and communication that is also used as a way of being more pointed and direct. Jokes can establish rapport and informality, bring people together over differences, introduce risky ideas and even present criticism in an acceptable way. Most topics can be lightened with good humour. For example, one may find the British poke fun at the royal family, politicians, religion, class, society as well as each other. Much British humour and sarcasm may be delivered through subtle or dry understatements. However, while their humour may seem harsh at times, it is important to avoid taking personal offence to jokes.

However, its strategic position between the Middle East and Eastern Europe means it has endured many different civilizational periods that inform its culture today. Cyprus has two very distinct ethno-religious communities – the Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots – that share cultural affiliations with Greece and Turkey respectively.', 'Since 1974, the country has been partitioned into two main parts on the basis of these ethnicities. The geography, culture, politics and daily life of Cyprus have become deeply characterised by the ‘', 'Cyprus Problem', '’. As such, the island has a unique psyche. People tend to be very loyal to their ethnic communities. Nevertheless, Cypriots share strong values of hospitality and personal honour. The increasing globalisation of the island has seen the people become more urban, internationally focused, cosmopolitan and outward-looking. Meanwhile, their ', 'expatriate', ' communities across the world are known for keeping strong links with their homeland, preserving their traditions and culture.', 'The Cypriot People', 'Greek Cypriots', 'Earliest records show that Cyprus was originally settled by Hellenic Greeks 2,000 years BCE. Throughout centuries of invasion from other empires, the Greek population and influence on the island has remained constant. In 2016, the State Statistical Office estimated that 74.6% of the population was Greek Cypriot, 9.8% was Turkish Cypriot and the remainder were people of foreign nationalities.1 The Greek Cypriot majority are identified as Greek-speaking Orthodox Christians. They share a close cultural affiliation with mainlander Greeks, with most Greek Cypriots seeing themselves as their Hellenic brothers and sisters.', 'Greek Cypriots articulate the combination of history, religion, culture, values, language and nationalism as “', 'ta ethima mas', '” (our culture and traditions). This shared link of culture through the Hellenic history, Greek language and Orthodox religion means it is often common for Greek and Greek Cypriot ', 'expatriate', ' communities to merge in foreign countries. Due to these similarities, many Greek Cypriots live in or visit Greece at some point in their life. A large proportion of students complete their university education in Greece. This encourages further cultural exchange between the two countries.', 'Despite their cultural compatibility, Greek Cypriots tend to draw strong distinctions between themselves and mainlander Greeks. For example, they may wish to distance themselves from the stigma of Greece’s financial situation. Many believe that their Cypriot government is less corrupt and that they have a better economic standing. Others may seek to distinguish themselves culturally. For instance, the dialect of Greek spoken in Cyprus is unique to the island, with about 15% of the words used in Cyprus alone. The Greek Cypriot identity continues to elicit a great deal of pride in people.', 'Turkish Cypriots', 'In 1571, the Ottoman Turks conquered the island and absorbed it into their empire. This introduced a sizeable Muslim minority to the island’s population. Today, this minority is known as the ‘Turkish Cypriots’. They are generally Sunni Muslims, speak Turkish and use the Latin alphabet. Turkish Cypriots are often described as some of the most ', 'secular', ' Muslims in the world (see more under\xa0', 'Islam', ' in the ', 'Religion', ' section).', 'The cultural exchange between the Turkish Cypriot population and Turkey has increased since partition. There is also a strong political relationship as the Turkish government subsidises the economy of the Turkish Cypriot side of Cyprus and has troops deployed on the ground. Despite this relationship, many Turkish Cypriots see themselves as distinctly different from Turks. It is important to differentiate between Turks (natives of Turkey) and Turkish Cypriots (natives of Cyprus). Some people who have Turkish heritage in Cyprus prefer to be referred to as “', 'Kıbrıslı Türk', '” in Turkish (meaning ‘Cypriots who are Turks’) instead of the term “', 'Kıbrıs Türkü', '” (Turks of Cyprus) to emphasise both their Turkish-ness and Cypriot-ness.', 'The Cyprus Problem', 'It is important to have a general understanding of the events that led to the partition in order to appreciate people’s situations today. The island was ruled and administered by Britain from 1878 until 1960, becoming an official Crown Colony of the UK in 1925. In the years leading up to Cyprus’ independence in 1960, Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots expressed different visions for the future direction of the country. The Greek Cypriot majority showed increasing interest in the political union of Cyprus and Greece (', 'enosis', '), which Britain strongly objected to. The country became independent instead, with two British sovereign bases remaining on either side of the island. A power-sharing agreement was reached between Greek and Turkish Cypriots to govern the country. However, tension over the political representation of each ', 'ethnicity', ' remained and led to an outbreak of fighting between the two Cypriot communities. The UN sent in a peacekeeping force in response.', 'In 1974, the mainland Greek army engaged in a coup designed to unite the island with Greece. Turkey responded by deploying troops on the island with the stated purpose of protecting the Turkish Cypriot communities. The Turkish forces gained control of over a third of Cyprus. A cease-fire was brokered by the UN, which remains in effect to this day. The two-thirds of Cyprus that was unoccupied by Turks was separated from the northern part. The UN polices a buffer zone, or ‘Green Line’, that divides the two communities despite the infrequency of present-day violence.', 'In 1983, the Turkish Cypriot leader declared the Turkish occupied area as its own country – the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus. Turkey is the only country that recognises the northern side’s claim to independent sovereignty. The international community recognises the entire country as the Republic of Cyprus. The southern Greek Cypriot side is thought of as the government-controlled area, whilst the northern Turkish Cypriot side is regarded as the non-government-controlled area.', 'Current Attitudes', 'The daily lives of Cypriots are still largely dominated by the country’s partition. Almost two generations have grown up as citizens of the ‘Cyprus Problem’, with a consistent domestic and international focus on the issue.2 It is hard to determine someone’s position on the matter without creating tension. The mention of partition and history can easily arouse passion. Generally, both communities want to see the island reunite. Many people are tired of the political manoeuvring and desire ', 'harmony', ' and a final resolution. However, there are conflicting visions of the nature of this reunification. Differences of opinion are found within both the older and younger generations.', 'Decades of partition have also developed stereotypes and mistrust of the other ', 'ethnicity', '. Many Greek-Cypriot children learn that the island was and ‘will always be Greek’, while Turkish Cypriots learn that ‘the island is Turkish and should go back to Turkey’.3 There are essentially two different ‘truths’ circulating as each ', 'ethnicity', ' perceives the events differently. For example, Greek Cypriots see the Turkish intervention as a catastrophic invasion, whilst Turkish Cypriots see it as a peacemaking operation and celebrate it as ‘Peace and Freedom Day’.', 'It should be noted that animosity between the two ethnic groups is primarily based in nationalism and arguments over political representation and not religion and culture. The two groups had coexisted for hundreds of years before partition. A study showed that only 28% of Greek Cypriots and 32.5% of Turkish Cypriots believe that ethnic-religious-cultural differences between the two groups caused the conflict.4 The majority blame errors committed by leadership and the intervention of foreign states for the creation and perpetuation of the conflict.5 The vast majority of day-to-day interactions between people belonging to each ', 'ethnicity', ' are friendly and peaceful.', 'In 2003, the Green Line was opened to make it easier for people to travel to the other side of the country. This has increased interethnic interaction and understanding. It also gave many people the opportunity to visit land that they had been displaced from for the first time in decades, igniting hope that they may one day be able to return home. Indeed, the older generation tends to hold a lot of nostalgia for what was lost (in terms of land and lifestyle). Meanwhile, many of the younger generation tend to be more resigned to partition, as they have never known a united Cyprus.', 'Demographic Shifts and Settlement Patterns', 'Cypriots traditionally lived rural lifestyles. It was common for people to have their own farmland, which they grew seasonal harvests from. A gradual movement towards urbanisation began in the 20th century but was fast-tracked by partition. The partition of Cyprus encouraged large numbers of Greek and Turkish Cypriots to move north or south of the divide. Hundreds of thousands of people were displaced and forced to migrate to the side of their respective ', 'ethnicity', '. As the Greek Cypriot population was far larger than the Turkish Cypriot population, this created a disparity in population density.', 'The Greek Cypriot population has been compressed to the southern two-thirds of the island. It is estimated that 80-90% of the entire island’s population lives on this side.6,7 Due to this high population density, there has been a dramatic shift from rural living to urban living. Many apartments have been built for those Greek Cypriots that were displaced or forced to leave hometowns in the north where their family and community had lived for generations. Therefore, much spare land has been put to use.', 'Meanwhile, the northern third of the island is sparsely populated. Immigrants from Turkey have continually arrived in order to increase the total labour force and population. These were often Turks from the lower social demographic that migrated to the vacant land in hope of a better life. Despite the influx of Turkish mainlanders, the northern economy has not experienced the same economic growth as the south and continues to be subsidised by the Turkish government. Many Greek Cypriots still have property on this side of the divide, which has been repurposed for Turkish housing, demolished for resorts or left vacant. Therefore, the issue of land redistribution continues to be a very sensitive issue.', 'Cyprus also has a big culture of emigration, in part prompted by the political upheaval.\xa0It is\xa0estimated that there are just as many Cypriots living abroad as there are on the island. For example, roughly half a million Greek Cypriots are presumed to be living outside the country, with major concentrations in the United Kingdom, Australia, South Africa, Greece and the United States.8 There is a general impression in Cyprus that people living outside of the country are doing exceptionally well. Today, many people move to other countries in Europe for their tertiary education.', 'Ethnic Diversity', 'Cyprus is becoming increasingly ', 'multicultural', ' in the 21st century. Due to the British colonial influence on the island (and the fact that there are still two British sovereign bases), so a substantial English population has been a consistent feature of the country. Almost all Cypriots speak English as a second language, and it has become the unofficial universal language that crosses ethnic barriers. There is also a small group of Cypriot Arabic-speaking Maronite Christians, and some who speak Armenian. However, the ', 'expatriate', ' population is growing and becoming more diverse. There are increasing numbers of migrants from Asia and the Middle East moving to Cyprus seeking work. This has changed the demographic of people in service jobs. Furthermore, the tourism industry is one of Cyprus’ biggest sources of economic growth. This has attracted more young travellers to the country.', 'The State Statistical Office estimates that 15.6% of Cyprus’ population consists of foreign residents.9 These population figures were taken by the Greek Cypriot government and exclude the number of Turkish mainlanders residing in the north of the country. Therefore, the proportion of non-Cypriots living in the country is likely much higher. In 2016, the majority of marriages performed in Cyprus involved people of foreign nationality.10 There is some apprehension about the loss of traditional lifestyles and culture among the growing population of ‘', 'xenos', '’ (‘stranger’/’foreigner’ in Greek). However, for the most part, Cypriots have been very tolerant of change.', 'Nationalism', 'Some have called Cyprus “the Slave of the Mediterranean”, as it has had a long history of invasion and foreign occupation that informs its culture today. Its strategic position between Eastern Europe and the Middle East saw it conquered repeatedly over thousands of years. It was ruled by the Assyrian, Egyptian, Persian, Byzantine, Venetian, Ottoman and British empires (among others), before gaining independence for the first time in 1960. Even since Cyprus gained independence, there continues to be a constant military presence on the island. It remains compulsory for all men to complete military service in the Cypriot National Guard; most do so in early adulthood.', 'This history has created a sense of defensive nationalism. Cypriots often see themselves as heroes of history. There are many national legends of Cypriots achieving single-handed defeats against conquerors. People tend to be very protective of their citizenship, as their sovereignty has been repeatedly threatened. Cypriots also tend to be strongly opposed to outside interference – especially considering Greece, Turkey and Britain’s roles in creating the current situation of partition.', 'Honour, Integrity and Trust', 'The concept of personal honour (‘', 'philotimo', '’ in Greek or ‘', 'onur', '’ in Turkish) is deeply embedded in Cypriot culture. People take deep pride in their hospitality, generosity and honesty, as these are qualities thought to determine their integrity as a person. Honour is derived from doing things for others that are beyond one’s own self-interest, whether it be for their family, friends or country. This part of the culture influences the Cypriot psyche to see everyone as ‘brothers’ or ‘sisters’ and help them as such. In Cyprus, people share a cohesive understanding of heritage, ', 'ethnicity', ' and culture that forms a very strong community network, encouraging generosity and hospitality on a daily basis. This can partly explain why ', 'expatriate', ' communities are so closely-knit overseas.', 'A sense of honour and trust is deeply important to friendships. Cypriots generally need to feel that another person has an honest character before developing a lasting relationship. The importance Cypriots place on personal integrity can explain many ', 'cross-cultural', ' differences in the way they uphold social contracts. For example, people are often comfortable relying on each other’s word rather than written agreements as they trust that another person’s sense of honour and pride will assure their reliability. Indeed, dignity and pride is a strong motivator to fulfil one’s social responsibility and duty, as a loss of integrity or trust can take a very long time to regain. Many Cypriots say that this sense of honour is the reason why there is such a low crime rate in Cyprus.', 'As one’s honour is very important, Cypriots can be sensitive to comments that imply they lack integrity. For example, to call someone a ‘', 'tzampatzis', '’ (‘free rider’ in Greek) or to imply they are lazy would likely be perceived as an accusation upon his or her integrity and taken to heart. There can be a lot of pressure on individuals to save face and protect their personal reputation. This can mean that some Cypriots may be reluctant to admit errors. In some cases, disagreements can turn into long-standing grudges as both parties try to protect their pride. It may be difficult to detect when you have offended someone, as people may try to hide when you have hurt their pride. For example, if you offend a Cypriot, they may not make it known immediately, but instead make it hard for you to contact them. Indeed, Cypriots are often considered quite stoic people. For example, if someone has a health complication, they may not complain or mention it until it gets to a quite serious point.', '', '_____________________', '1\xa0Statistical Service of the Republic of Cyprus, 2017: These population figures exclude Turkish migrants residing in the north of the country.\xa02\xa0Lee & Quintero, 20153 Hadjipavlou, 20074 Hadjipavlou, 20075 Hadjipavlou, 20076\xa0Statistical Service of the Republic of Cyprus, 20177\xa0International Crisis Group, 20108\xa0Papadakis, 20119\xa0Statistical Service of the Republic of Cyprus, 201710\xa0Statistical Service of the Republic of Cyprus, 2017']"

It is common for Iranians to refer to themselves as “Persian”, which carries the association and prestige of the historical empire.', '1', ' The Iranian culture and people have a history of being one of the most progressive in the Middle East. Iranians can often recount the country’s legacy and heritage in great detail.', 'Modernity and Education', 'One of the most notable characteristics of the Iranian people is their thirst for knowledge. In first interactions with a stranger on the street, one may find that a taxi driver is, in fact, an ‘expert’ on architecture, or a colleague can explain the complex history of countries they’ve never visited. Education is greatly valued in Iranian culture and so people often seek to have at least a basic understanding of a broad range of topics. Many people study for a higher education or post-graduate degree as strong respect is shown to those who have proof of expertise. All leaders are expected to have a high level of academic achievement or theological education.', 'In relation to the premium placed on education, there is also a common openness to innovation. Indeed, general society embraces science and development, and there seems to be a cultural consensus that Islamic principles do not necessarily contradict technological and scientific progress. Iran has been swift and forthcoming in adopting and bringing forward new ideas. One can notice it in the institutions dedicated to technology and medical sciences, but also in the general population’s remarkable mobilisation of multiple social networks.', 'Islam in Iran', 'Across its history, Iran has continuously pursued modernisation whilst looking to maintain its spiritual integrity. It has had a Muslim majority population for centuries and so the culture is deeply characterised by its strong Islamic influence. The Iranian people have a record of practising quite a progressive form of Shi’a Islam. The cultural interpretation of the religion has been traditionally open-minded, making allowances for liberal behaviour and improvements in women’s rights. People generally had more the freedom of choice and expression over, for example, whether they wished to pray or wear a ‘', 'hijab', '’.', 'However, in 1979, the Islamic Revolution overthrew the ', 'secular', ' monarchy and the Islamic Republic was subsequently established. This system of theocratic governance remains in place today. Under it, Islamic theologians and ‘', 'mullahs', ""’ constitute the highest ranks of leadership. They ensure civil law and court decisions abide by the principles of Islam, and are generally highly conservative. Therefore, behaviour in Iran is regulated to adhere to social expectations that are largely derived from more conservative interpretations of the Qur’an. This religious governance directly affects the public, political, economic and legal aspects of people's lives. Today, the conservative interpretations of Islam have become a major social force and dictate much of what Iranians can and cannot do. Iranians regularly break the Islamic civil rules; however, this always carries a risk of arrest. Speaking up or publishing material that questions the current system can also be interpreted as anti-Islamic."", 'Many Iranians have misgivings about the politicisation of Islam. Much of the population seeks a return to a more liberal society; older generations can often remember the time when public life was more easy-going and younger generations, exposed to alternative ideas through the internet and overseas education, yearn for a lifting of restrictions on individual behaviour.', 'Despite the firmly entrenched reach of the Islamic Republic, Iranians generally discuss politics with vigour. Indeed, subjects that Australians often avoid (politics and religion) are not necessarily taboo conversations among friends and colleagues in Iran. Many people use humour to criticise their leaders through ‘doublespeak’, and share their theories of scandal and corruption with strangers. Nevertheless, while politics is commonly ridiculed, most people are very reluctant to criticise Islam both from a social standpoint and a moral/theological perspective. It is important for non-Muslims to understand that many Iranians generally recognise the ', 'government', ' as the source of their complaint, not Islam.', 'Surface and Underground Culture', 'Perhaps the biggest implication the system of governance has had on Iranian culture relates to the way Iranians conduct themselves in public and private. For many Iranians, there is a personal contradiction between what they ‘want’ to do and what they are ‘permitted’ to do. Therefore, it is very important to distinguish the political culture and values of the government from the culture and values of the Iranian people.', 'At first glance, public behaviour in Iran is generally conservative. It is uncommon for people to overtly express themselves or publicly identify with unconventional subcultures or hobbies. However, many Iranians refer to this as the ‘surface’ culture in which people act as their ‘', 'zaaher', '’ (“visible”) identity. In public, people behave in the way that will benefit them (i.e. keeping to the rules to avoid attracting the attention of government operatives). However, individuals may not necessarily believe in these actions and instead fake them for the sake of their safety and reputation.', 'More recently, Iranians have been referring to themselves as living ‘underground’. ‘Underground’, people behave the way they truly believe, often relaxing their moral codes of behaviour. This is the way they act at home or with their inner circle, where they can reveal their ‘', 'baaten', '’ (“inside” or “true”) identity without risk of arrest. For example, at one point, all music and dancing were banned and Iranians had to carefully hide the activities they loved ‘underground’.', 'Pride and Humbleness', 'Behaviour in Iran is also noticeably influenced by people’s perceptions of pride and dignity. This is based on the traditional idea that people should protect their personal and family honour by giving a public impression of dignity and integrity. As people don’t want to risk doing something shameful, they generally adhere to social expectations. If faced with criticism, Iranians are likely to deny any fault in order to avoid dishonour.', 'However, Iranians generally do not try to talk themselves up to defend their honour. While prestige can be gained through achievement, boasting of it is seen as pretentious and can draw quick dislike and denigration. Instead, people are expected to self-deprecate their success. The more humility a person shows, the less likely they are to be criticised. By the likes of ', 'tall poppy syndrome', ', people are expected to be humble and unassuming about themselves. Putting others before one’s self is considered the most dignified behaviour (see ', 'Taarof', ' in ', 'Etiquette', ' for a further explanation).', 'It is worth noting that the expectations regarding what is ‘honourable’ and ‘shameful’ can vary significantly between different people, family backgrounds and social attitudes. For example, the younger Iranian generation generally do not feel the need to stringently apply the honour code and will often hide certain ‘shameful’ actions they consider reasonable from the older generations, who might be deeply offended by such behaviours.', 'Social Hierarchies', 'Iranian culture remains relatively class conscious. Significant class differences were exacerbated through periods of recent economic hardship and instability. While some households may employ servants, others may struggle to put food on the table. Nevertheless, much of the population shares the benefits of the middle class. Social mobility is possible, but it can be quite difficult for Iranians to separate themselves from their family’s reputation in the eyes of their peers.', 'Largely, one’s family is the biggest social indicator of status. Education, wealth and ethnic or tribal associations can all affect a person’s social standing. It is also considered quite prestigious to be able to trace one’s heritage back for centuries. In recent decades, access to political power has become one of the biggest social advantages and indications of privilege. Those families that have connections with the government are sometimes afforded latitude to deviate from strict rules, or they may receive more lenient consequences for their actions. Religious association also has powerful leverage in society. Someone who is a theologian is presumed to have the moral high ground and power in decision-making, gaining them a lot of respect.', 'Diversity', 'It should not be assumed that all Iranians share the same language, cultural, religious or political beliefs. There is a huge variation in social codes, behaviours and beliefs between different regions of Iran. One will find different cities have varying reputations from one another, whilst rural areas can have almost entirely different traditions and values. Furthermore, ethnic minorities tend to have distinctive forms of social organisation that are sometimes more collectivistic.', 'In recent years, there has been reasonably little disagreement between ethnicities in Iran – which is significant considering the diversity. Most Iranians seem to be unified across ethnic divides. Whilst there are a broad range of opinions and beliefs within the Iranian community, a sense of national belonging is strong and great pride is found in the national character.

The land of ancient Iraq was part of Mesopotomia and is considered to be the birthplace of advanced civilisation. The modern capital, Baghdad, was the cultural and economic epicentre of the Islamic world for centuries. However, the legacies of Iraq have been overshadowed by the international and civil conflicts that have overwhelmed the nation for the past few decades. The political turbulence has set the country back massively and is likely to continue to do so. Iraqis commiserate about this. However, despite dire situations, the Iraqi people take a lot of pride in their nation and may consider themselves special to have such a rich and prestigious history. Broadly, Iraqis show solidarity for their country at national events and celebrate their sovereignty.', 'Generally, Iraqis are religiously acceptant and have familiarity with ethnic diversity. However, Iraqi culture is rather intolerant of any diversion from traditional conventions and behaviours. It is a fundamentally conservative society where innovation is usually resisted and rules are expected to be followed diligently. Behaviour and public decorum are restrained and strictly governed in accordance to Islamic values. People can expect to suffer serious consequences from divergences and, therefore, society tends to approach self-indulgences with trepidation.', 'The perception of honour in the eyes of others regulates much of Iraqi behaviour. The ', 'honour culture', ' is based on the idea that people should protect their personal and family honour at all costs. This requires individuals to give a public impression of dignity and integrity by stressing their family’s achievements and positive qualities. In Iraq, the culture pressures individuals to conceal and deny anything that could tarnish their honour. Any admission of error or failure brings shame and loss of ', 'face', ' on a person (and his or her family). Therefore, to prevent such indignity in Iraq, criticism is rarely given directly and praise is expected to be generously offered. The younger Iraqi generation generally doesn’t feel the need to apply the honour code this stringently. It is more prevalent among the older, conservative population. However, one’s personal integrity and dignity is still seen as an important virtue throughout Iraq. People tend to take great pride in helping others.', 'In the ', 'hierarchy', ' of respect, age demands deference and obedience. There is also a major segregation of authority between genders in Iraqi society. Women are sheltered and do not have as much power as men. They may be considered to be the possession of a man instead of an individual and are expected to be submissive and quiet in the presence of men. They behave modestly and those who are Muslim may be wary of interacting with men who are not members of their family. They are expected to dress conservatively in dresses that reach at least below the knee and preferably to the ankle, and in blouses that cover the shoulder and much of the arm.', ""Iraq is more collectivistic than Western societies. Individuals often perceive themselves to be members of 'groups'. These groups reflect or come to define who its members are and often demand a high degree of loyalty. For example, the group’s interests usually supersede those of the individual, even if they conflict. Furthermore, group members expect to receive preferential treatment over anyone who is not part of the group. In return for this loyalty, an individual gains a sense of belonging, protection and unity.""]"

Thereafter, it was placed under the British Mandate. The first large wave of Jewish migration to the region was undertaken mainly by Eastern Europeans, Russians and some Yemeni in the late 1800s to early 1900s. These initial Jewish migrant communities were instrumental in establishing the first Israeli agricultural settlements on the land, such as Tel Aviv. Further Jewish immigration and land purchases increased in the subsequent decades.', 'However, the main driver for mass immigration of European Jews to ', 'historic Palestine', ' was the tragic events of the Holocaust and subsequent developments of various Zionist movements (see ', 'Zionism', ' below). Between 1937 and 1947, the Jewish population that resided in Palestine before Israel’s creation increased from 400,000 to approximately 625,000.2 Sectarian tensions and violence between the Arab majority and Jewish minority escalated as immigration increased. In 1947, the United Nations proposed the partition of Palestine into separate Jewish and Arab states. The Jewish nation-state of Israel was established shortly after in 1948.3', 'Israeli Identity', 'Israel’s national identity is largely connected to Judaism.

There are also many ', 'secular', ' Jews for whom their Jewishness is a cultural, ethnic or ancestry identity marker, rather than a religious or national identity marker. Various Jewish symbols have become Israeli national symbols since independence, such as the Star of David which is featured on the Israeli flag. The ancient Hebrew language was also revived to become the official spoken and written vernacular of the country. The language’s revival has helped restore the Jewish people’s cultural and linguistic connection to the Middle East. Hebrew also provides Israelis with a common language that unifies the diversity of Jewish migrant groups, though many also retain linguistic connections through phrases and slang that reflect their ethnic heritage (such as Yiddish, Arabic or Russian).', 'Israel emphasises and maintains a cultural link to both Europe and the Middle East, as well as North Africa. The connection with Europe may be evident through music, with the popularity of Western classical music. For example, Israel has a national philharmonic orchestra and opera, numerous regional and local orchestras, and conservatoriums. Another notable example is the country’s participation in the Eurovision Song Contest since 1973. Meanwhile, Jewish Israelis’ connection to the Middle East is visible in the popularity of Middle Eastern-style pop music, the use of Semitic languages (i.e. Hebrew and Arabic) and its cuisine.', 'Ethnicity and Ancestry', 'Alongside the diversity of the pre-existing local populations, the various waves of ', 'aliyah', ' (immigration) of Jewish people from around the world over the last two centuries have shaped Israel into an ethnically and religiously diverse country. For instance, Israel’s political parties represent a range of different ethnic, religious and ideological affiliations. Consequently, no party has won any parliamentary election by a simple majority. It is estimated that 74.4% of Israelis identify as Jewish, while 20.9% identify as Arab and 4.7% identify with some other ', 'ethnicity', '. Within the two broad categories of ‘Jewish’ and ‘Arab’, there are many sub-ethnic and religious groups, including Ethiopian Jews, Russian Jews, Palestinian Muslims and Christians, Druze, Bedouins, as well as sub-Saharan Africans and smaller groups of overseas workers from Asia.', 'Socioeconomic status can differ depending on ethnic or religious affiliations. In particular, Israeli Arabs, ultra-Orthodox (', 'Haredi', ') Jews and Jews who are ethnically Sephardi/Mizrahi are often in the lower-income bracket and face greater challenges to gaining employment and housing opportunities. Ultra-Orthodox (', 'Haredi', ') Jews also tend to have lower participation in the workforce as they prioritise religious study and commitments. Levels of education also vary considerably. For instance, Ashkenazi Jews are generally more educated than Sephardi/Mizrahi Jews and Israeli Arabs, with 33% of Ashkenazim having a university degree compared to 18% of Sephardim/Mizrahim and 16% of Arabs.4 These socioeconomic gaps can create social tensions, though such friction rarely escalates.', 'Jewish', 'The majority of the Israeli population identify as ethnically Jewish (74.8%), of which 76.9% were born in Israel.5 The term ‘Jewish’ can be quite complex, as it is used as an ethnic or religious identifier depending on the context. The distinction between ‘ethnically Jewish’ and ‘religiously Jewish’ is fluid in some cases. Some see ethnic Jewishness and religious Jewishness as deeply intertwined, while others view them as separate identities. The Pew Research Center (2016) found 22% of Israel’s Jewish population considered Jewishness as a matter of religion, 55% considered it a matter of ancestry and culture, and 23% considered it to be a mixture of religion, ancestry and culture.

As of 2018, there are 132 settlements and 121 outposts (settlements established illegally without Israeli government approval) in the West Bank.18 Israeli settlements continue to grow, with the population growth of settlements (3.5%) being just under double that of Israel’s population growth (1.9%) in 2018.19', 'The decision to reside in settlements is often based on religious or political grounds or economic reasons. For instance, some residents may have a desire to claim the West Bank as Israeli land, while others move into settlements because the housing tends to be cheap and subsidised.20 The quality of housing also differs among the settlements. Some are vast communities that resemble suburban developments, while others resemble shanty outposts.', 'The presence of Israeli settlements in the West Bank has become one of the most intractable issues between Israelis and Palestinians (see the ', 'West Bank', ' in the ', 'Palestinian profile', '). Numerous UN resolutions have found the building of Israeli settlements to be a violation of the Geneva Convention and international law.21 Increasing Israeli residency poses barriers to the prospect of achieving a two-state solution as the settlements are built on land Palestinians see as part of their potential future state. Israeli settlements also continue to be a fundamental issue in domestic politics. Religious and religious-nationalist groups generally believe that the West Bank is rightfully part of Israel and therefore believe that Jewish Israelis are free to build settlements.22', 'Zionism', 'In a broad sense, ', 'Zionism', ' refers to the ideology of establishing, supporting and protecting a Jewish nation-state in what is now the country of Israel.

Therefore, it is important to understand the context from which ', 'Zionism', ' originates to understand how it informs Israeli society today.', 'Emergence of Zionism', 'The major event that sparked the beginning of ', 'Zionism', ' was the emancipation of Jewish people from ghettos in France (1791). This was followed by subsequent Jewish liberation movements across Western and Central Europe that allowed many Jewish people (who had previously been confined to petty trades and banking) to get involved in various factions of European society, such as academia, science and the arts. The rapid assimilation of European Jews dramatically altered relations between themselves and the non-Jewish population. Many non-Jewish people increasingly saw Jewish communities as economic threats. Meanwhile, many Jews themselves faced a challenge reconciling traditional Judaism with the values of ', 'secular', ' European society.', 'Resentment of some Jewish people’s rapid success in ', 'secular', ' society led to the rise of a new wave of ', 'anti-Semitism', ' across Europe.

In 1939, approximately 10 million of the world’s 16 million Jewish people resided in Europe.23 By 1945, nearly 6 million Jews were killed throughout German-occupied Europe, mostly in the major concentration camps.24', 'This devastating event had a major impact on the growth of ', 'Zionism', ', as many of Europe’s surviving Jews sought refuge in ', 'historic Palestine', ' to create a safe haven to rebuild their lives. ', 'Anti-Semitism', ' continues to be a highly sensitive topic for many Israelis due to collective historical experiences of hostility, discrimination and persecution. Therefore, it is important to consider that criticism or negative comments about the existence of Israel as a nation-state, its government policies (especially regarding Palestine) or about Zionist ideology may be interpreted or misconstrued as anti-Semitic.', 'Zionism Today', 'Today, ', 'Zionism', ' often refers to the imperative to protect and support Israel as a Jewish nation-state. Though Zionist ideas and beliefs generally inform the politics and governance of Israel today, the level of influence Zionist ideas should have on Israeli politics and society continues to be a point of tension. Those who identify as Zionists often have different opinions as to how the protection and support of Israel should be carried out. Moreover, ', 'Zionism', ' is not necessarily supported by all ethnic or religious Jews. For instance, only 33% of ultra-Orthodox (', 'Haredi', ') Jews believe that the term ‘Zionist’ describes them accurately, while 85% of religious (', 'Dati', ') Jews agree that ‘Zionist’ describes them very or somewhat accurately.25 Some other religious communities, including select Christian churches and denominations, may actively support ', 'Zionism', '. However, Arabs and Palestinians generally have negative views on ', 'Zionism', ' and the impact of its application on their people.26 Thus, one should not assume that all Israelis or those who identify as Jewish also identify with the ideas and applications of ', 'Zionism', '.', 'Immigration to Israel (Aliyah)', 'The Hebrew word ‘', 'aliyah', '’ (literally meaning ‘ascent’) refers to the act of immigrating to Israel. Someone who ‘makes ', 'aliyah', '’ is referred to as an ‘', 'oleh', '’. Approximately 3.2 million people have immigrated to Israel from all over the world since the country’s establishment in 1948.27 Thus, Israel is home to many who are first-, second- or third-generation migrants. There has been a massive cultural transformation over generations as Jewish European immigrants have collectively come to form the native-born Jewish Israeli population. The large number of immigrant groups has significantly influenced the dominant values of society, making Israeli culture quite unique.28', 'Aliyah', ' continues to have ideological, historical and political impacts in Israel as a cultural concept and process. Ideologically, as the return of the Jewish ', 'diaspora', ' to their ancestral homeland, ', 'aliyah', ' is one of the main goals of the Zionist movement. It accounts for most of Israel’s population growth before and after the proclamation of the State of Israel. For instance, between 1922 and 1948, 75% of the population growth in historical Palestine was due to Jewish immigration, and between 1948-1960, immigration made up 69% of annual population growth.29 Politically, ', 'aliyah', ' is also linked to the Law of Return, whereby all non-Israeli Jews are entitled to settle in Israel and become Israeli citizens. This includes their descendants (in accordance to Orthodox Judaism’s understanding of Jewish ancestry), as well as those who convert to (Orthodox) Judaism.', 'In the present-day context, ', 'aliyah', ' is generally understood as a personal journey for an individual who wishes to relocate to Israel. The reasons for making ', 'aliyah', ' vary, with some seeing the act as a religious imperative, while others wish to affirm their Jewish identity, to strengthen their feeling of belonging, employment opportunities or higher standard of living. Nearly the entire Jewish population in Israel (98%) agree that all Jews have a right to make aliyah or move to Israel and become a citizen.30', 'Various institutions have been established to assist immigrants in their transition into Israeli society. There are various private and government-sponsored intensive language programs (known as ', 'ulpanim', ') that help adult immigrants learn Hebrew for free or minimal fees. Another related institution is the ', 'merkaz klita', ' (‘absorption centre’), which combines the ', 'ulpan', ' with long-term accommodation for families. Nonetheless, many continue to maintain ties to their ethnic heritage, despite their broader affiliation to the Jewish Israeli identity. For instance, some may visit synagogues established by their respective ethnic communities. Another example is that, while most newspapers are printed in Hebrew, a considerable number are also published in English, Yiddish, German, Russian, Polish, Arabic, French, Bulgarian and Romanian.', 'Emigration from Israeli (Yerida)', 'The term ‘', 'yerida', '’ (literally ‘descent’) is the somewhat derogatory term that refers to emigration from Israel (i.e. the opposite of ', 'aliyah', '). ', 'Yerida', ' can be a sensitive topic for some Israelis for a variety of reasons. Those with strong Zionist sentiments may be critical of the act of ', 'yerida', ' due to the efforts undertaken to bring the Jewish ', 'diaspora', ' to their ancestral homeland. Geopolitical and domestic issues often form part of the reason Israelis may decide to emigrate or travel abroad. For instance, some wish to emigrate due to the cost of living or for professional reasons, while others leave due to ongoing geopolitical tensions in the region.', 'Travel and tourism have gained popularity over recent decades. It is not uncommon to find Israelis holidaying abroad to unwind after intense experiences of completing their compulsory military service. Of those who undertake ', 'yerida', ', many follow a circular migration pattern and eventually return (', 'hazara', '). Israel allows for dual citizenship, which helps facilitate circular migration patterns. Indeed, Israelis who have migrated abroad usually maintain regular contact with their family or return to Israel often to visit.', 'Regional Conflicts and Cultural Impacts', 'Experiences of ongoing military conflict over multiple generations have significantly impacted Israeli culture and society.\xa0Israel’s history supports the notion that the Jewish people have been in a constant position of defending themselves, whether out of vulnerability due to the shared experiences of the\xa0Holocaust (', 'Shoah', ') or facing hostile forces. Many Israelis are familiar with experiences of grief and loss due to the pervasiveness of death in historical and ongoing conflicts. A consistent feeling of vulnerability and uncertainty has persisted as each generation has faced different social and psychological stresses.', 'The establishment of Israel in 1948 was marked by violence and upheavals. Over subsequent decades, the nation fought against multiple Arab countries that opposed the nation-state’s existence in ', 'historic Palestine', '. These conflicts included the ', '1948 Arab-Israeli War', ', the ', '1956 Suez Crisis', ', the ', '1967 Six-Day War', ', the ', '1973 Yom Kippur War', ' as well as the ', 'Lebanon Wars', ' in ', '1982', ' and ', '2006', '. Israel came to occupy the Palestinian-majority territories of West Bank and Gaza following the broader Arab-Israeli conflicts, creating further tensions and frustrations in these territories. In 1987, Palestinians responded with non-violent protests and boycotts towards the Israeli military, leading to the First ', 'Intifada', ' (‘uprising’). This movement escalated to more violence, including throwing rocks, molotov cocktails and hand grenades that primarily affected the security of Jerusalem.', 'While the First Intifada ended in 1993, the 21st century has been marked by further violence and terrorism between Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories. The Second Intifada occurred from 2000 to 2005 and was more violent, with Palestinian militants using suicide bombs, rocket attacks and sniper fire.31 Suicide bombers often targeted Israeli shopping malls and public transportation, which sparked constant fear of the possibility of sudden attacks. Israelis generally considered the conflict to be a prolonged terror campaign perpetuated by the Palestinian National Authority and various Palestinian militant groups. This impacted many Jewish Israeli perceptions of Palestinians as violent terrorists, which led to further social tensions.', 'While Israel’s role in conflict is sometimes portrayed as aggressive in international dialogues, Israelis generally see these actions as a necessary defence. As a result, some regularly find themselves in the position of loyally defending their country, which somewhat reaffirms stereotypes of them as combative people. Many Israelis have undergone compulsory military service in hostile and often violent areas and may feel deeply committed to protecting Israel as a way to maintain the safety of their families and friends. Ultimately, these experiences have strongly contributed to an emphasis on ', 'militarism', ' and patriotism in Israeli culture.', 'Militarism', 'Militarism', ' has been a feature of Israeli society since the nation was established. This is the belief that a country should maintain a strong military capability and be prepared to use it to defend or promote national interests. Emphasis on ', 'militarism', ' differs depending on the level of regional instability within Israel. However, the Israeli government has traditionally devoted considerable resources to national defence. Today, Israel continues to be one of the countries with the highest military spending as a portion of their GDP.', 'The Israeli Defence Force (IDF) plays a major role in the lives of most Israelis. Israel enforces active-duty military conscription of 32 months for men and 24 months for women. Military service is compulsory for Jewish men and women, as well as Druze and Circassian men. A number of minority groups are allowed an exemption, such as ultra-Orthodox Jews on the condition of religious study (though this remains a contentious political issue). Arabs who identify as Christian or Muslim (including Palestinian Arabs) may volunteer, but the areas of the military they can serve in are restricted. The IDF also accepts non-Israeli citizens; thus it is not uncommon to find volunteers from the Jewish ', 'diaspora', ' serving.', 'Military service is openly acknowledged and normalised from a young age. Initial testing to determine someone’s potential role in the military begins during high school. Completing one’s compulsory military service demonstrates respect, devotion and duty towards the Israeli nation-state and is a major part of the ', 'sabra', ' (native-Israeli Jew) identity. Israelis who do not or cannot complete their compulsory military service may face social disapproval. Moreover, military service can often be used as a way to indirectly discriminate against particular non-Jewish groups. For instance, jobs or housing opportunities may advertise that the individual must have completed their compulsory military service. High military ranking can also open up many employment opportunities once an individual has returned to civilian life.', 'Given the pervasiveness of the IDF, the boundary between military and civilian spheres of Israeli society are somewhat vague. For example, reserve duty for all Israelis who have undertaken their compulsory military service ultimately means someone may be recalled into the military and rapidly mobilised for deployment, especially Israelis of certain military ranks. Thus, one is expected to be adaptable as they transition from working at home or in the office to an army base or combative territory. Military presence can be found throughout the country, which for many Jewish Israelis provides a sense of security. Certain values and attitudes learned in the military also influence broader Israeli society, such as military language and slang, duty to protect the Jewish people, camaraderie among fellow Israelis and ongoing commemoration of military successes, losses and heroism.', 'Social Structures', 'Education', 'Education, especially tertiary studies, is a major value in Israeli and Jewish culture. It is often seen as a form of social mobility into a higher socioeconomic status. As such, parents are usually willing to make financial sacrifices to ensure their children have the opportunity to be highly educated. In Israel, primary and secondary education is often separated along ethno-religious lines. Schools fall under three broad categories: state ', 'secular', ' schools, state religious schools, or private religious schools. State religious schools often include a combination of Jewish studies and ', 'secular', ' studies, while some ultra-Orthodox schools may focus solely on Torah study. There are also schools oriented towards the Arab population by teaching in Arabic and offering a curriculum based on Arab history and culture. Few schools integrate both Jewish and Arab students.', 'Legal Jurisdictions', 'Separation along ethno-religious lines also occurs in Israel’s legal structure, which combines basic common laws with several separate jurisdictions according to religious affiliation. The ', 'millet', ' (religious community) system is still in place from Ottoman times, which means that Jews, Muslims and Christians are subject to separate jurisdictions for personal matters. Such laws include marriage, divorce, adoptions and inheritance. This means there is no civil judiciary that applies to all Israeli citizens for a large area of law dealing with personal matters. Navigating legal matters can be quite complex. For instance, some citizens are still under the jurisdiction of religious authorities even if they identify as ', 'secular', '. This may sometimes cause social tensions and challenges for Jewish Israelis who are neither religiously observant nor identify with Orthodox forms of Judaism.', 'Kibbutz and Moshav', 'Kibbutz', ' and ', 'moshav\xa0', 'are two kinds of housing and social structures unique to Israel. In a ', 'kibbutz', ' or ', 'moshav', ', each resident is actively involved in building the community and its resources. The number of residents vary; some are small with only ten residents while others may have up to 1,500 people. The term ', 'kibbutz\xa0', '(meaning ‘gathering’ or ‘collective’) refers to collective settlements that are usually focused on agricultural and industrial work. Life in a ', 'kibbutz', ' is typically communal and resources are generally distributed among the residents equally. Reforms within individual ', 'kibbutzim', ' have led to some becoming privatised, while others have introduced differential wages, opened up to tourism or allowed residents to work outside the communes. There are over 250 ', 'kibbutzim', ' across the country.32', 'Meanwhile, the term ', 'moshav', ' (meaning ‘settlement’) refers to a type of cooperative agricultural settlement. The underlying principle of ', 'moshavim', ' is private ownership of land, minimal hired labour and communal marketing. The ', 'moshav', ' style of settlement is an intermediate stage between privately owned settlements and the total communal living of the kibbutz. A common kind of moshav is ', 'moshav ovdim', ' (‘settlement of workers’), which consists of privately farmed agricultural land with an emphasis on citrus farming and mixed farming.', 'Adaptability and Entrepreneurship', 'A wide history of immigration and collective experiences of adversity and endurance have driven entrepreneurship and influenced many Israelis to be adaptable and innovative in their daily lives. For instance, the local ', 'shuk', ' (market) is filled with entrepreneurial vendors and constant negotiations of the prices of market goods. A popular phrase relating to Israelis’ adaptable and entrepreneurial attitude is ‘', 'chutzpah', '’ (literally meaning ‘rudeness’ or ‘cheekiness’), which conveys a sense of assertiveness, directness and confidence. ', 'Chutzpah', ' is part of the blunt and forthright communication style of many native-born Israelis known as ', 'dugriut', ' (‘straight talk’). Criticism and ideas are usually communicated with ', 'chutzpah', '. At times, ', 'cross-cultural', ' communication can be a challenge as some Israelis may come across as blunt or inattentive to social or cultural ', 'norms', ', though this is rarely the intention (see ', 'Communication', ' for more information).', 'A major example of entrepreneurship is the large number of startup companies in the country. Israel is sometimes known as the “Startup Nation” due to having the largest number of startups per capita in the world (approximately one startup for every 1,400 people).33 Moreover, approximately 1,100 to 1,380 startups are established every year.34 Thus, it is not uncommon for Israelis to be involved in or know someone working in a startup or the technology sector.

israeli,"['Honour', 'Sincerity', 'Integrity', 'Hospitality', 'Sensitivity', 'Adaptability', 'Wariness', 'Lebanon is a small yet diverse country. It’s approximately 160 km long and 56 km wide at its largest point, bordering Syria, Israel and the Mediterranean Sea. The predominant culture is fundamentally conservative and exhibits a great deal of respect for traditions, drawing on many Arab customs. Long-standing Islamic and Christian traditions remain deeply ingrained in social ', 'norms', ' and expectations. However, many practices and lifestyles also reflect European influences. This is partly due to its coastline’s proximity to Europe (as a key point of contact for trade between the East and West), as well as a period of French occupation in the 20th century. Ultimately, contemporary Lebanese society is highly diverse. It is common to see both traditional Lebanese attire and modern European fashions in city streets. As such, the Lebanese people are familiar with a plurality of lifestyles and are often capable of easily adapting to other societies.', ""Lebanon is more collectivistic than many Western societies. Individuals often perceive themselves to be members of 'groups'. These groups reflect or come to define who its members are and often demand a high degree of loyalty. For example, the group’s interests usually supersede those of the individual, even if they conflict. Furthermore, group members expect to receive preferential treatment over anyone who is not part of the group. In return for this loyalty, an individual gains a sense of belonging, protection and unity. The American University in Beirut conducted a study that concluded Lebanese people generally feel their collectivist loyalty is strongest for their family. Their subsidiary group loyalties are then towards their religion, Lebanon as a nation, their ethnic group, and lastly – political party."", 'The Lebanese social ', 'hierarchy', ' is stratified by class. Many of the differences in status are determined by wealth, which usually correlates along familial or religious lines. Those who are wealthy are usually distinguishable by their lavish clothes and belongings that they proudly display. People are generally comfortable interacting across the social classes. However, there is a clear social separation between those occupying the lowest status – beggars – and the rest of society. The cultural concept of ‘filial ', 'piety', '’ generally demands that elders receive the utmost respect from those younger than them, regardless of their social status.', 'The perception of honour once regulated much of Lebanese behaviour. Though the honour code is not stringently followed, it has left cultural imprints on communication styles. The ', 'honour culture', ' is the learned principle that people should protect their personal and family honour at all costs. This requires individuals to give a public impression of dignity and integrity by stressing their family’s achievements and positive qualities. In Western society, self-criticism can position a person beyond moral reproach by others. In Lebanon, however, the expectations of society can pressure individuals to conceal or deny anything that could tarnish their honour to avoid bringing shame on the individuals (or their family) by peers. Therefore, to prevent such indignity in Lebanon, criticism is rarely given directly and praise is expected to be offered generously. The younger Lebanese generation generally doesn’t feel the need to strictly uphold the honour code. Such customs are more prevalent among the older, more conservative population. However, one’s personal integrity and dignity is still seen as an important virtue throughout Lebanon. It is arguably a reason why the Lebanese are particularly charitable and hospitable.']"

This was widely opposed by Arab Palestinians who comprised almost 90% of the population of Palestine at this time, and owned about 97% of its land.', '42', ' Many perceived British occupation as a form of colonial subjugation.', '43', ' The British promised independence after the mandate period.', '44', ' However, they also pledged to facilitate the establishment of a “national home for the Jewish people”, as stated in the Balfour Declaration.', '45, 46', ' The declaration reflected growing Zionist movements that had been taking hold across Europe, largely in reaction to ', 'anti-Semitism', '. For a number of Jews, ', 'Zionism', ' refers to the ideology of establishing, supporting and protecting a Jewish nation-state in the historic region of Palestine, which they believe to be their ancient homeland (see ', 'Core Concepts', ' of the ', 'Israeli profile', ' for more information). Many Jews had already begun migrating to Palestine based on this principle before the British Mandate was established, making up around 10% of the population (84,000 people) according to the 1922 census.', '47', 'The demographics of Palestine were rapidly transformed as Jewish immigration and land confiscation increased tenfold during the British Mandate. The Jewish population grew from approximately 84,000 in 1922 to at least 608,000 in 1946, constituting over a third of the population.', '48', ' Violence between the Jewish minority and Arab majority escalated as it became clear that the region’s future and independence would largely be determined by each community’s population size and land ownership by the end of the mandate period.', '49', ' Many Arabs viewed the Zionist claim of land as a form of colonialism and oppression that sought to drive present inhabitants out of their homeland.', '50', ' In 1947, the UN recommended that the region be partitioned into two separate states for Arabs and Jews respectively (i.e. ‘Palestine’ and ‘Israel’) in an effort to give both communities their own state and independence.', '51', ' However, this was opposed by the Arab majority who desired a unified Arab Palestine, and saw the partition as another instance of a foreign power dispossessing the Palestinian people of their land and autonomy.', 'The Creation of Israel and the Nakba (Catastrophe)', 'The State of Israel was declared and established in 1948. This was a violent process that saw hundreds of thousands of Palestinian Arabs forcibly expelled from the region, mostly by Zionist militia groups.', '52', ' Today, Palestinians remember the date of Israel’s creation (May 15th) as the ‘', 'Nakba', '’ (catastrophe), marking the beginning of an ethnic cleansing of Palestine and almost total destruction of Palestinian society. It also symbolises the beginning of ‘', 'al-ghurba', '’, which means ‘banishment from the homeland’ or ‘separation from one’s native country’.', '53', ' This refers to the experience of exiled Palestinians and the formation of a large global ', 'diaspora', ' (see ', 'Exile, Migration and the Diaspora', ').', '54', 'Conflict and Violence', 'Most Palestinians have been impacted directly or indirectly by the violence and conflicts that have occurred in the region since the Nakba.

Israel seized more territory outside the borders of the UN agreement following the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, eventually occupying all the territories that had been originally designated to Palestine (West Bank and Gaza) following the Six-Day War in 1967.', 'Tensions continued to rise in the West Bank and Gaza as Palestinians increasingly struggled under occupation. Frustration erupted in 1987 with the First Intifada (‘first uprising’). This uprising started with peaceful protests and boycotts by Palestinian residents, but escalated after Israeli forces responded with violence. Many Palestinians anticipated Israel’s territorial control of the West Bank and Gaza to ease following the end of the First Intifada in 1993. However, the occupation became further entrenched. Disappointment at the failure of further peace talks led to the Second Intifada (2000-2005), which was much more violent than the first. Military attacks have also continued into the present day, especially between Israeli forces and Gazans (see ', 'Life Under Occupation', '). While there have been fatalities on both sides, the fighting has resulted in far higher civilian casualties on the Palestinian side. However, ultimately violence continues to be a constant feature of occupation, impacting the lives of multiple generations of Palestinians.', 'The Palestinian Identity', 'The notion of a unified Palestinian identity has deep roots in history. However, the term “Palestinian” came into common global use after the creation of the Israeli state, to refer to the Arab people who lived in the region previously.', '56 ', 'Similarly, Palestinian Arabs use the term to indicate the nationalist concept of a Palestinian people with rightful claim to the land and statehood.', '57', ' As the contemporary Palestinian identity was largely solidified through politics, it is closely associated with the people’s emancipatory struggle and resistance against dispossession, oppression, injustice, exile and separation.', '58', ' In this way, the Palestinian identity can symbolise a ‘cause’ just as much as an ethnic, regional or national identity.', '59', ' Some individuals with dual identities (e.g. Palestinian-Australian) may feel more connected with their Palestinian identity as their political awareness grows, and they develop a greater sense of responsibility to represent their people’s plight.', 'At its simplest, to be “Palestinian” today\xa0generally signifies that one\xa0shares a genealogical link to the land. For example, one may live in the region or descend from a family that once did. The ability to trace these links back through previous generations remains central to the expression of the Palestinian identity outside the region.', '60', ' For example, Palestinians living overseas commonly explain their connection to Palestine when first meeting one another.', '61', ' People tend to emphasise their shared identity as Palestinian Arabs with a common homeland, rather than focusing on religious differences (e.g. Muslim or Christian).', '62', ' Discrimination between Palestinians based on racial, ethnic or linguistic grounds is rare.', '63', 'The concept of a Palestinian identity also signifies\xa0a sense of a shared past and future in the form of a Palestinian state.', '64', ' This is complex, as\xa0the understanding of “Palestine”\xa0can be expressed in a number of ways. For example, Palestine can invoke concrete ideas of the past, and may represent a real, tangible, geographic place or state that an individual hopes to return to. However, many Palestinians\xa0living or born in exile have been prevented from visiting or returning to the region by the Israeli government. Therefore, their\xa0understanding of Palestine may be more fluid, imagined through stories passed through the family as cultural heritage.', '65', 'Creative Expression and Collective Memory', 'Creativity and imagination are important features of Palestinian culture. As many people are prevented from being able to access their material cultural heritage (such as historic sites and buildings), different mediums are being used to express identity and pass on collective memory. The Palestinian people’s history, struggles and aspirations are often embodied in artistic expression, such as music, art, dance, film and literature. Many Palestinians (especially youth) use such mediums to convey their people’s plight to the broader world.', 'Some characteristics of Palestinian and/or Arab life have also become national symbols. For example, the ‘', 'kefiyyeh', '’ (a checkered black and white scarf) has become an emblem of Palestinian nationalism.', '66', ' Meanwhile, the olive tree (a common feature of the Palestinian landscape) has come to symbolise the Palestinian identity and attachment to their land; its slow growth, longevity and drought resistance is seen to represent Palestinian resistance and resilience.', '67', 'Ultimately, a Palestinian’s family represents the deepest connection to their origin, heritage and identity. This is especially important for the ', 'diaspora', ', who may seek to maintain these links outside of Palestine. Oral storytelling is a key feature of Palestinian households that keeps tradition, cultural heritage and memory alive throughout experiences of displacement and dispossession.', 'Resilience and Activism', 'The constant denial of the Palestinian national identity, ', 'self-determination', ' and human rights has led many to develop a strong sense of activism, especially amongst ', 'diaspora', ' communities. Individuals commonly hold a sense of responsibility to defend and justify their people’s fight. Political engagement with the Palestinian cause is especially common overseas, with many actively raising awareness through film screenings, fund raising and artistic expression (see ', 'Creative Expression and Collective Memory', ').', 'Palestinians are generally very proud of their people’s strength and resilience. Dedication and service to the Palestinian cause and resistance efforts has also become one of the greatest sources of honour and continues to confer social respect. For example, some of the most celebrated national heroes are resistance fighters and those who have been imprisoned or martyred (killed) while standing up for the rights of Palestinians.', 'Honour (Sharaf)', 'Much social behaviour is traditionally influenced by Palestinians’ awareness of their personal honour. In this sense, ‘honour’ encompasses an individual’s reputation, prestige and worth. Preservation of honour and community opinion is often at the forefront of people’s minds (although this differs across geographical and demographic contexts). It influences people to behave conservatively in accordance with social expectations, to avoid drawing attention to themselves or risk doing something perceived to be dishonourable.', ""A person’s honour is determined by their personal actions as well as the behaviour of those they are associated with (i.e. their family, community or any 'group' they belong to). Therefore, if an individual does something dishonourable, their origins (e.g. family) may be implicated as the cause. In this way, there is a cultural pressure on individuals to protect their personal reputation and the image of those around them. This may require people to emphasise their positive qualities, family members’ achievements and adherence to social expectations in order to give a public impression of dignity and integrity."", 'There are many ways one can gain or lose honour. Traditionally, honourable behaviour relates to having a high social status, maintaining women’s sexual modesty and exhibiting core Arab values, such as honesty and hospitality. However, this has also evolved over time. For example, education is seen to bring honour to the Palestinian family as it has become highly valued for both men and women. In the political climate, dedication and service to the Palestinian cause has also become one of the greatest sources of honour (see ', 'Resilience and Activism', '), as well as connection with the land (a prized and diminishing resource).', 'The senior male of a family is considered to be responsible for protecting the honour of the family. They are often concerned with the modesty and chastity of the women in their family, which can inform rules of behaviour around their dress, social interactions, economic activity and public involvement (see more in the ', 'Family', ' section). These expectations vary depending on the attitude of an individual family. However, a breach of social compliance by a woman can be perceived as a failure on the man’s behalf (her father, husband or brother). Palestinians from rural areas tend to hold tightly to traditional social dynamics and informal ', 'norms', ', such as the preservation of honour, whereas some urban areas have allowed for more expansion of social and individual freedoms.', 'Community Interdependence', 'Palestinian culture is collectivist, whereby strong loyalty is shown to one’s extended family and friends, the community, and the broader collective of Palestinian people. People’s relationships with their neighbours and community are generally closer than that experienced by many in the English-speaking West. Friends are often very loyal, performing favours for each other on a regular basis. This is important in the Palestinian Territories where a shortage of resources and underfunded social services are often unable to meet basic needs. It is common to call on personal contacts for support, opportunities and assistance in navigating life under occupation (see ', 'Clan Systems', ' for more information on this).', 'In some cases, whole neighbourhoods may be involved in helping to meet challenges. For example, when a family experiences a particular hardship (such as the death of a family member), it is customary for the entire community to assist with cooking and cleaning so the family has time to mourn without the stress of daily activity. Men are traditionally considered to be financially responsible for others and are also expected to assist any woman in the community that is struggling financially (e.g. widows).', 'Personal Connections (Wasta)', 'A Palestinian’s status or influence is often determined by their personal connections. Prominent family names continue to carry social capital, even if the family itself is no longer particularly ‘wealthy’. Affiliation to a particular political party can also confer a certain social status or class. Relationships and reputations play an important role in completing professional, personal and social tasks. This is understood through the concept of ‘', 'wasta', '’\xa0(loosely translating to ‘who you know’), which refers to utilising one’s connections and/or influence in order to get things done.', '68', ' This can be observed when people turn to a close friend or relative for help instead of an institution (for example, getting hired or waiving a fine).', 'Wasta', ' and ', 'nepotism', ' are considered to be legitimate ways of gaining opportunities and completing transactions. However, it also manifests as preference based on who one knows. Therefore, one’s social mobility is often tied to their personal networks or family name. This is most noticeable in job opportunities, whereby members of notable families are more likely to secure better jobs. Meanwhile, those in disadvantaged positions often lack such contacts. This is one of the largest indicators of privilege amongst Palestinians, frequently manifesting in a rural-urban divide.', 'Clan Systems', 'Palestinian Arab society is characterised by an extended family system, traditionally known as a ', 'clan', ' or ‘', 'hamula', '’. Membership to a ', 'clan', ' is determined by shared ancestry through the father’s male lineage that generally connects multiple extended families. Women who marry outside of their ', 'clan', ' will become members of their husband’s ', 'clan', ' – as do children of the marriage. Some Palestinians have more fluid ideas of ', 'clan', ' inclusion, stemming from widespread dispossession and exile. For example, Palestinian refugees residing in camps have been known to recreate ', 'clan', ' identities with one another based on their place of origin (rather than bloodline) in order to form the support systems needed.', '69', 'Clans provide a strong source of individual and family security. ', 'Clan', ' members generally share a sense of solidarity and loyalty to protect one another from outside harm. Traditionally, men share a code of honour (', 'mithaq al-sharaf', ') based on the idea that an attack or threat to one member constitutes an insult to the entire ', 'clan', '. This could be a physical attack, or something honour-based (see\xa0', 'Honour', '). Today, clans often play an important role and have considerable local influence in conditions where the government cannot provide reliable protection or support.', '70', ' For example, they have become particularly strong under the conditions of Israeli occupation. Members will often manage and distribute finances among the ', 'clan', ' to offer crucial support to households suffering from lack of employment. This is especially noticeable in Gaza, where economic conditions are dire and unemployment is a chronic problem.', '71', 'The ', 'clan', ' system is present throughout all social classes in the Palestinian Territories; professionals are just as likely to have ', 'clan', ' identities as unskilled labourers. However, Palestinians are generally less likely to maintain such ', 'clan', ' identities when living under stable governments with strong civil societies. For example, since the Palestinian Authority established further rule of law and governmental institutions in the West Bank, the influences of the tribal system and blood relations have weakened. Moreover, this specific ', 'kinship', ' system does not play a very active role in the lives of those resettled in Western countries. While many of those living overseas (particularly second- or third-generation Palestinians) may not be familiar with “', 'clan', '” identities per se, they usually continue to place emphasis on extended family support systems.', 'Bedouin Tribes', 'There are several Palestinian Bedouin groups that live across the Palestinian Territories and Israel who share a lineage distinct from the majority of Palestinian Arab clans. They mainly identify as “Palestinian”, but use the term “Bedouin” to refer to their tribal heritage and culture.', '72', ' Traditionally, Bedouins were semi-nomadic tribes that traversed the desert throughout the region without state interference. However, Israeli restrictions on freedom of movement in the Palestinian Territories and Israel have limited their nomadic-herder lifestyle.', '73', ' Thousands have been displaced from desert homelands in present-day Israel and relocated mostly to the West Bank.', '74', ' The vast majority of Palestinian Bedouins are no longer nomadic.', 'It is estimated around 40,000 Bedouins live in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, mostly in towns or cities.', '75', ' Their families are generally socioeconomically disadvantaged and often have less access to adequate infrastructure, education and healthcare than the majority Palestinian population.', '76', ' Those that remain in Israel live in some of the poorest conditions (mostly in the Negev desert), often with the constant threat of eviction or home demolition.', 'While tribal life has been heavily impacted by occupation, several Palestinian Bedouin groups continue to maintain aspects of traditional tribal Arab culture.

The majority of the population is ethnically Arab, mostly descending from nomadic tribes that have traditionally lived throughout the region. Saudi culture is fundamentally traditional and conservative. Islam has an extensive influence on society, guiding people’s social, familial, political and legal lives. The Saudi people generally share a strong moral code and cultural values, such as hospitality, loyalty and a sense of duty to support their community. They are often highly aware of their personal honour and integrity. However, the country is also highly modernised and industrialised. At the time of writing, social ', 'norms', ' and rules of behaviour are being transformed rapidly as the people balance their cultural traditions with the modern age. Customs and attitudes can also vary significantly between different regions, minorities and tribes. Therefore, it is important to recognise that all descriptions of a mainstream ‘Saudi culture’ in this profile are subject to variances depending on people’s age, social status, religious belief, tribe or region of origin.', 'International Reputation', 'Saudi Arabia has been one of the most globally influential countries in the Middle East over the past century. Its strong economy has made it strategically important to the international community. Home to the birthplace of the Prophet Muhammad, Saudi Arabia has also become the\xa0de facto\xa0leader of the Sunni branch of Islam. The country has a crucial influence on the rest of the Gulf and beyond into the wider Muslim world.', '1', 'Saudi Arabia’s dominant and powerful position in global politics means that opinions of the country and its people are often formed before encountering them. The country is typically explained through a Western lens that sees it as an oppressive and regressive society (particularly regarding its treatment of women and political dissidents), and describes it by its differences to the Western world. As a result, Saudis regularly find themselves in a defensive position when confronted with negative foreign assumptions. Many can feel compelled to emphasise the positive aspects of their culture in order to prove that they belong to an ethical society and are good people. Some may feel uncomfortably pressured by foreigners to denounce their own culture. However, such criticism does not always reflect a deeper understanding of the country’s cultural configuration. For example, some Saudis argue that critics lack an awareness of the challenges they face as a tribal society adapting to a fast-changing global environment. It is important to understand the origins of the kingdom that inform the culture today.', 'National Formation and Identity', 'The first notion of a Saudi state emerged in the mid-1700s when an alliance when formed between Muhammad ibn Saud (a tribal ruler of the central al-Diriyya region) and Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab (an Islamic theologian and cleric).', '2', ' The two shared a goal of uniting the different Arab tribes of the peninsula and returning them back to an earlier interpretation of the principles of Islam. This religious revivalist movement popularised the Wahhabi ideology (see ', 'Religion', ') and is attributed to have birthed the Saudi state and its expansion over the coming centuries.', 'The modern Saudi Kingdom was formed after Abdulaziz bin Abdul Rahman Al Saud (more commonly referred to as ‘Ibn Saud’) gained power over multiple regions through a series of conquests in the 1920s. He eventually declared himself king in 1932, solidifying the country’s governmental power structure.\xa0Saudi Arabia has been ruled under an absolute monarchy since, and the alliance between religious clerics and the Al Saud family continues today.', '3', ' State leadership is passed down to Ibn Saud’s descendants through the male line of the Al Saud family.', 'Saudi Arabians were traditionally tribal nomads, villagers and townspeople.

However, it is important to recognise that levels of social conservatism still differ between regions, tribes and minorities in Saudi Arabia. For example, rural areas and the central regions (surrounding the capital of Riyadh) may be somewhat more socially conservative than cities with heavy international exposure (e.g. Jeddah).', 'Gender Separation', 'There is a broad gender separation throughout Saudi Arabian society that influences and determines different ideas of privacy and space.\xa0According to the religiously based view, most Saudi Muslim women choose to wear a head or hair covering whenever in the presence of a man that is ‘non-', 'mahram', '’. It is also a cultural norm for some women to veil their face – usually by an abaya (long robe) and a ', 'niqab', ' (hair and face veil). This means many Saudi women are veiled whenever in public, as this is a domain where they mix with men. The tradition has been changing recently as more women are choosing to reveal their faces or not to wear a ', 'hijab', ' at all (mostly younger women in cities). However, people are usually very sensitive to what belongs to the public and what belongs to the private domains. For example, if a Saudi man was working on a roof and could see into a neighbour’s courtyard, they would inform the head of the household so his female family members could be forewarned not to go into the garden/courtyard unless veiled.', 'Unrelated men and women generally avoid communicating socially in person.', '11', '\xa0There is a difference between ', '‘ikhtilat’', ' (men and women together in an open space – permissible) and ', '‘khilwa’', ' (unrelated men and women together in an enclosed space – not permissible). To avoid the latter, there are many female-only and men-only buildings in Saudi Arabia (e.g. most schools and universities). Banks, universities and government institutions have separate entrances for men and women; some restaurants are segregated; and there are also “families only” spaces (such as malls) that exclude single males.', '12', '\xa0However, while physical cross-gender friendships between Saudis are largely prevented, gender mixing now also occurs in the online space.

Many arrive from countries such as India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, the Philippines, Egypt, Palestine and Sri Lanka.', 'There are also subtle divisions between Saudi citizens themselves, sometimes based on tribal affiliations, levels of education, religious affiliation (i.e. Sunni or Shi’a) and location (i.e. rural or urban). Most Saudi nationals generally belong to the middle or upper classes. Members of the elite class are often distinguishable by conspicuous displays of wealth (such as owning luxury cars) or by their family name. They may be more religious, educated, wealthy or hold positions of power in industries such as oil. Generally, anyone with links to the royal family also has more power and influence. However, being rich or well-educated does not earn a person automatic respect. A person’s integrity, honour and treatment of others is thought to be more important than their affluence or privilege in Saudi Arabia (see ', 'Honour (Sharaf)', ' below).', 'Community Interdependence', 'There is a very strong community focus embedded in Saudi culture and the patrilineal ', 'kinship', ' system remains pervasive throughout society. People are often mutually reliant on their relatives and neighbours. This is due to the collectivistic nature of the culture, as well as people’s sense of duty ', '(al-wajib)', '. Indeed, the charitable sector is one of the largest areas of activity for groups and associations throughout Saudi Arabia. There is a general understanding that with privilege comes a greater responsibility to care for the community. Therefore, those in more fortunate circumstances often feel an obligation to help those that are struggling. Community involvement is especially important in times of sadness. For example, when a family goes through a particular hardship (such as the death of a family member), it is customary for the entire community to visit every day and help lighten the burden.', 'Honour\xa0(Sharaf)', 'The notion of honour ', '(sharaf)', ' is a central concept that guides behaviour and significantly influences interactions in Saudi culture. It is deeply intertwined with ideas about one’s personal dignity', ' (karama)', '. Preservation of honour and community opinion is often at the forefront of Saudi’s minds. There is often a strong cultural pressure on individuals to protect their reputation. Therefore, conservative conduct is the norm; people tend to avoid drawing attention to themselves or risk doing something perceived to be dishonourable (such as diverging from the social expectations). Saudis often seek maintain dignity through compromise, patience and self-control. One may find that criticism is rarely given directly and praise is expected to be generously offered. For example, people may gloss over things or downplay their flaws to make them seem more positive (see ', 'Communication', ').', 'A person’s behaviour or honour is generally considered to reflect their family/upbringing. Thus, Saudis can be wary of the fact that they need to give a public impression of dignity and integrity to protect the honour of their household. If a person is perceived to be dishonourable, their whole family shares the shame. Public disgrace can have serious consequences, affecting people’s social lives and future opportunities. In some cases, a family may feel obliged to shun the member of the household that brought shame upon them in order to clear their family name.', 'The senior male of a family is considered to be responsible for protecting the honour of the family. They are often particularly concerned with the behaviour of female relatives, as women have more social expectations to comply with (see ', 'Gender Roles', '). These relate to their moral code, dress, social interactions, education, economic activity and public involvement (see more in the ', 'Family', ' section). A breach of social compliance by a woman may be perceived as a failure on the man’s behalf (her father, husband or brother) to protect her from doing so.', 'Protectiveness (Gheera)', 'Gheera', ' (or ', 'ghayrah', ') is a pervasive feeling in Saudi culture and extends especially to family and personal honour. It is an Arabic word that describes an intense emotion of honourable protectiveness. In this cultural context, it most commonly refers to a man’s protectiveness and jealousy over his female family members. This kind of jealousy is seen as necessary, as it is the uneasiness in a man’s heart that motivates him to protect women from indecency. Most Saudis interpret gheera as a love and willingness to do anything for one’s female family members.', 'Tribal Identity and Bedouins', 'One’s personal tribal identity can be a deep source of pride for people, especially among Sunni Muslims in the centre of Saudi Arabia. Many aspects of Saudi culture are derived from traditional tribal Arab culture. For centuries, nomadic tribespeople, known as ‘Bedouins’, have made the Saudi Arabian desert their home. Traditionally, Bedouins live in extended family groups, moving when they need new pasture or water. Some continue to live in the desert or among the mountains, while most have moved to towns or cities.', 'Bedouins are renowned for their generosity and courage. It is traditional for them to host any visitor from another town, city or region for three days, regardless of the resources they have to accommodate the person. This almost always involves a feast for the guest – even if that means sacrificing their last goat or camel for the occasion. Today, traditional Bedouins do not necessarily have a high social status, and may even be somewhat looked down upon by many urban Saudis.', '15', '\xa0Nevertheless, they still represent the essence of traditional Saudi identity.

Before it became globally recognised as a war-torn country, Syria had a historical tradition of tolerance and ', 'pluralism', '. While recent conflict has stressed sectarian tensions, most Syrians remain very tolerant and respectful of both religious and ethnic diversity. Indeed, in light of recent fighting, many particularly oppose the aggravation of such divides. Syrians are often familiar with a diversity of cultural lifestyles; the internet, media and pop culture have exposed people (especially the university populations) to the liberal values and behaviours of the West. It is common to see both traditional Syrian attire and modern European fashions in city streets.', 'Nevertheless, broadly speaking, the culture is conservative and exhibits great respect for traditions. Islam is the majority faith and many of the current traditions and customs observed by society are grounded in Islamic values. People often resist changes or diversions from these social conventions (particularly the older generations) and so modest behaviour is the norm. The population is also generally more comfortable with the presence and stability of a defined authority. This has translated into a broad acceptance of power hierarchies within society. The attitude is changing significantly as the political situation has deteriorated and conflict has escalated into civil war. However, Syrians are ordinarily very peaceful people, preferring to cooperate with established authorities rather than point out inequality in society.', 'The rural-urban distinction has become quite prominent over the last 25 years as the government directed most of its resources to the cities. People from regional areas usually have lower levels of education and are more collectivistic in their community organisation. Due to economic hardship, hundreds of thousands were forced to migrate to urban areas in the last ten years before the uprising. These metropolitan areas further reflect the cultural and historical diversity of Syria. For example, Damascus (the capital city) is known as the oldest continually inhabited city in the word. Ancient architecture usually characterises the inner city before sprawling into modern suburbs and apartment buildings. Roughly 60% of the population lived in urban areas before fighting caused displacement.', 'While most Syrians identify as Arab, the country also contains much ethnic diversity. Many Iraqis and Palestinians have immigrated and there are large ethnic minorities including Armenians, Greeks, Assyrians, Circassians, Mandeans and Turkomen. The largest are the Kurds of which there are roughly 2.5 million.', 'Social Hierarchies', 'Syrian society is quite hierarchical and people tend to adhere to the stratifications between social statuses. A person’s wealth, education and profession are the biggest class indicators. Trade professions or jobs that require physical labour are viewed as low-status positions. More deference is shown to those people who have received university degrees and work in professions that require an advanced education. One’s age also determines the grading of respect in social interactions. It is expected that in social situations elders are highly regarded and given precedence over others who are present. For example, one would not disagree with the opinion of an elder unless able to express their point in a very respectful manner.', 'Relationship-Focused Culture', 'Syria is a collectivist society whereby strong loyalty is shown to familial, ethnic and social groups. People tend to structure their lives around the immediate social relationships important to them. Society is not tightly organised and schedules are not closely followed. Instead, daily activity is approached at a relaxed pace and more time is devoted to personal interactions. Syrians living outside the country often miss this chaotic freedom of their culture. In Syria, they often know their community intimately and visit their friends and family every day. The people-focused lifestyle gives individuals a sense of belonging and support. Syrians always endeavour to help their friends. In return for their efforts, they trust that the person will reciprocate the favour in the future when they request it.', 'While a wide nexus of relationships means Syrians are able to rely on many relatives and friends, it also affords very little privacy. A whole community can quickly find out about people’s private matters if they discuss them with someone outside their family. Therefore, much personal information is generally kept enclosed to family knowledge.', 'Honour', 'Norms', ' about behaviour are substantially influenced by a cultural perception of honour. Conservative conduct is the norm and people generally act in accordance to social expectations as they don’t want to stand out and/or risk doing something that is considered to be shameful. People have a strong awareness of personal integrity, which engenders Syrians with an incredible generosity. Pride and status is found in being helpful, hospitable and charitable to others. In this sense, the warmth of Syrians is quickly noticeable.', 'However, if one commits an error or failure, perceptions of dishonour and the social ostracising that can follow is known to have very real effects on people’s future opportunities and circumstances. One’s origins (i.e. family, city or ', 'ethnicity', ') are often implicated as the cause and their shame is shared by their family name. In this way, there is a cultural pressure for individuals to protect their personal reputation and the image of those around them. To prevent such indignity in Syria, criticism is rarely given directly and praise is often generously offered.', 'With the protection of their family honour in mind, instead of conceding that they are in difficult circumstances, Syrians may try to convince themselves that they don’t have an issue. People often feel they have to conceal their personal life and struggles in public despite feeling sad, weak or vulnerable. Syrians are often especially reluctant to accept money as assistance, even in desperate situations. In regards to this, it is important to note that many Syrians who are currently dependent on aid from others (be it international aid, refugee resettlement, assistance from friends) find the situation to be very undignified and resent the loss of agency. This feeling of dishonour has been especially noticed among men who can no longer fulfil their social role as patriarch and family provider.', 'The Conflict Situation', 'It should be noted that though the concepts described are general characteristics of Syrian culture, lifestyles in Syria have been significantly disrupted since the outbreak of the Syrian civil war. Degrees of obstruction may differ; imminent danger varies significantly between regions and cities depending on the restrictions of the regime or controlling insurgent body. Most Syrians are now primarily focused on safety and survival as the people are confronted with the atrocities of the conflict.', 'While the conflict in Syria is complex, having a rudimentary understanding of the key actors and circumstances surrounding it helps build deeper empathy with the Syrian experience. Syrians often notice and appreciate it when people are somewhat informed. However, it is best not to ask them to further explain the situation to you as they may wish not to recall or think about the conflict.', 'The Civil War', 'Syria is ruled by a one-party government, headed by President Bashar al-Assad. The Assad regime has been widely regarded as authoritarian, repressive and corrupt. During the Arab Spring in 2011, national uprising began as Syrian citizens protested against alleged human rights violations committed by the government. The protestors called for ', 'democratic', ' reforms, the lifting of Emergency Law in place since 1963, the release of political prisoners and multiparty elections. Some Syrians began appealing for the end of the rule of President Assad. Initial protests were met with harsh government retaliation, resulting in over a 1,000 deaths and 10,000 arrests. That summer the Free Syrian Army (FSA) formed to fight for Syria’s liberation from the Assad regime in a more militant way. The government has fought against rebel opposition with force, often showing blatant disregard for civilian life. Islamist extremists have also taken advantage of the instability and joined in the conflict, fighting both the government and the FSA at different times. Many international actors have involved themselves by supporting or supplying Assad, rebel fighters and/or the extremists with resources to fight against the opposition they see as a threat to their own interests. This has significantly contributed to the complexity and escalation of the conflict.', 'Public Opinion', 'The Syrian people are of different minds about the political situation. All will agree that the fighting has devastated Syria and come at an unacceptable cost to ordinary people. Beyond that, there are three general views – pro-Assad, anti-Assad, and ambivalent. Pro-Assad Syrians generally support Assad either out of conviction, shared identity (e.g. Alawite1), or the fear that voicing negative opinions of the government will endanger their family members remaining in Syria. The anti-Assad group includes those who believe in political freedoms, ', 'democratic', ' rights and/or abhor the brutality of the regime. Meanwhile, the ‘ambivalent’ group are are generally Syrians who were anti-Assad in the past, but are now uncertain about the regime because of the rise of Islamist extremism and the destruction of Syria. As Assad’s forces pose one of the strongest threats to ISIS, many Syrians feel conflicted as they want ISIS defeated but also wish Assad was not in power. These Syrians often justify their view with the observation that while political freedom under Assad’s dictatorship was bad, things are now much worse.', 'The political views of Syrians may spark intense discussion and friction among some. Others may have been conditioned by the crisis to keep their political views private. Regardless, respect people’s views and do not probe or share them with others. Consider that people’s political views, even voiced in another country, can impact on any family they have remaining in Syria.', '', '_____________________', '1 See ', 'The Alawites', '\xa0under ', 'Religion', '.']"

Its geographic position between these continents has exposed Turkish society to both Eastern and Western influences – from the Eastern Mediterranean and Eastern Europe to Central Asia and the Caucasus. As a result, the culture hosts unique blends of both traditional and modern conventions as well as religious and ', 'secular', ' practices. Indeed, Turks continue to negotiate their identity as some of the most ', 'secular', ' people in the Islamic world.', 'It is important to note that cultural practices, social attitudes and lifestyles vary significantly across the country. There are substantial differences between localities (rural/urban), regions, socioeconomic status, ethnicities and educational levels. Nevertheless, Turks are generally united by a strong national identity (see ', 'National Identity', ' and ', 'Kemalism', ' below). They also share certain core cultural values, such as a sense of honour, hospitality and neighbourliness.', 'Regional Differences', 'The Turkish population has become increasingly urbanised, with the majority of people (75.1%) living in industrialised metropolitan areas.1 This has influenced a shift towards more cosmopolitan lifestyles. For example, it is now far more common for urban Turks to have dinner at a dining table, as opposed to a traditional floor table. Major cities, such as Istanbul and Ankara, are typically very modern and ', 'multicultural', '. However, many classic Turkish institutions remain very popular. For instance, local bazaars continue to be the main trading centres instead of shopping centres.', 'Traditional cultural practices continue to be observed in many rural areas – particularly in the Eastern regions and along the border with Syria and Iraq. Rural populations often occupy the lowest rungs of the socioeconomic ladder and have less access to education and infrastructure. As a broad generalisation, the further one moves east towards Central, Eastern and Southeast Anatolia, the more traditional and Islamic the culture becomes.', 'Honour', 'The concept of honour (', 'onur', "") is deeply embedded in Turkish culture, noticeably influencing people’s behaviour. A person’s honour is determined by their personal actions as well as the behaviour of those they are associated with (i.e. their family, community or any 'group' they belong to). Therefore, if an individual does something dishonourable, their origins (e.g. family) may be implicated as the cause. In this way, there is a cultural pressure on individuals to protect their personal reputation ("", 'namus', ') and the image of those around them. This may require people to give a public impression of dignity and integrity by stressing their positive qualities, emphasising their family member’s achievements and adhering to social expectations.', 'There are many ways by which one can gain or lose honour. Typically, honourable behaviour relates to having a high social status, maintaining sexual modesty and exhibiting core Turkish virtues such as honesty and hospitality. ‘', 'Seref', '’ describes honour gained from accomplishments or achievements, whereas ', '‘izzet’', ' refers to honour that is derived from being good and generous to others. When one loses honour and feels a deep shame, this is referred to as ', '‘yuzsuz’', '.', 'It is worth noting that the expectations regarding what is ‘honourable’ and ‘shameful’ can vary significantly among people of different family backgrounds, regions, educational levels and social attitudes. For example, younger Turks may hide certain actions from the older generations who might be deeply offended by such behaviours. Those living in rural areas also tend to have more traditional and rigid views regarding the honour code. In these smaller communities, the social shaming following an act of dishonour can seriously affect one’s life, opportunities, socioeconomic status and self-worth. Nonetheless, the awareness of honour highlights the virtue underlying people’s actions and generally influences Turks to be generous, warm and honest.', 'Community Networks', 'Turkey has a collectivist culture whereby strong loyalty is shown to familial and social groups, as well as the broader nation. People’s relationships with their neighbours and community are generally closer than what many from the English-speaking West experience. Friends are often very loyal, performing favours for each other on a regular basis. It is common to call on vast social networks for support and opportunities, especially as the government does not totally guarantee social security in all cases. Though there is a strong group consciousness, Turks generally remain open and inviting to strangers and outsiders. Ultimately, neighbourliness is central to Turkish culture.', 'The sociable nature of Turkish society (as well as the very high population density) does not provide very much privacy or seclusion. The details of people’s personal lives are often shared among communities and friends; a family’s shortcomings can quickly become publicly known and damage their honour and reputation (', 'namus', '). Therefore, people may be careful to keep sensitive personal information within the family (see ', 'Honour', ' above). Nonetheless, Turkish migrants may miss this aspect of their culture as those in the English-speaking West generally show less interest and concern for the private lives of strangers. It should be noted that the influence of cosmopolitan ideals and technology has led to a general decline of collectivistic/community values in urban areas of Turkey. The younger generation may also show more preference towards ', 'individualism', '.', 'Hospitality', 'The Turkish community is often exceptionally generous, attending to those in need very quickly. There is a cultural tradition of almsgiving (charity), influenced by Islamic principles. Selflessness is noticeable on a day-to-day level.

Unsuspecting foreigners can sometimes take advantage of the hospitality of Turks, accepting overly generous offers that are made out of ', 'politeness', ' and are customarily meant to be refused. This can put Turks in difficult situations where they find themselves over-extending beyond their means.', 'Daily Life', 'In Turkey, daily activity is approached at an easier pace and more time is devoted to personal interactions.

Turks were at the centre of this mega-conquest, with the capital Istanbul (known then as ‘Constantinople’) acting as a central trade hub between the East and West. The Ottoman Empire dissolved following its allies’ defeat in World War I. The Republic of Turkey was founded in its place in 1923.', 'The formation of the modern Turkish state was accompanied by the development of a strong national identity. There was a general declaration that Turkey had been established for ‘Turkish people’. As such, one’s national identity as a Turkish citizen came to take more precedence than one’s ethnic identity. This powerful national identity has arguably unified the country whilst marginalising some minorities (see ', 'Ethnicities and Minorities', ' below). Nationalism continues to be one of the strongest ideologies in Turkish society. People are generally very proud of the Turkish country and culture, as well as its Ottoman history. Patriotism is visible on a day-to-day level. For example, one generally sees the Turkish flag displayed wherever they go in Turkey – hanging off houses, shops and highrise buildings.', 'Kemalism', 'Turkey’s national identity is often attributed to the leadership of Mustafa Kemal Atatürk (“father of the Turks”), who was the founder of the Republic of Turkey and its first president. Motivated by ideals of secularism and ', 'democratic', ' nationalism, Atatürk implemented a series of reforms during the course of his presidency (1923-1938). These were intended to modernise the country and alter public life to more closely resemble that of European cultures. For example, certain aspects of Western dress were made compulsory for citizens to wear, and the Turkish language was reformed to replace Arabic script with a modified Roman alphabet. He also removed Islam as a state religion after centuries of Islamic tradition and limited the visibility of faith in the public sphere (see ', 'Religion', ' for more information). Although the actualisation of his ideologies was complicated by various factors, the shift was dramatic.', 'Atatürk’s strongly held ideals and their newfound place in Turkish society were dubbed ‘Kemalism’. Many Turks continue to revere Atatürk for the steps he took to modernise their country and make it more culturally compatible with Europe. It continues to be a crime to insult his name or memory. The military has traditionally been recognised as the ‘protector’ of Kemalism, using force to overthrow leaders who have been perceived as threats to secularism and nationalism.', 'Political Shifts', 'Turkey’s social and political landscape has shifted a lot in recent years. This has been most noticeable in the rise of the populist leader Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.

He was democratically elected, originally taking power in 2002 as prime minister and president subsequently in 2014. However, his governing style has become increasingly authoritarian, limiting social freedoms, controlling the media and jailing those who stand in opposition to him.

This makes it one of the least densely populated land masses in the world. Nevertheless, it is also highly urbanised with people grouped into relatively small areas around the major cities. Many Australians enjoy a high standard of living with enough social and economic security to give them a reasonably optimistic outlook on the freedom and possibilities around them. A common national narrative hails Australia as the ‘lucky country’ for the comfortable quality of life it’s population enjoys. In a recent large-scale survey, SBS found nearly two thirds of Australians believe that their country has the best lifestyle in the world. Despite their good fortune Australians tend to resist overt displays of national superiority (with the exception of their sporting prowess). Moreover, at times they have criticised their own country as somehow lacking cultural refinement compared to their European counterparts.', 'Egalitarianism', 'Egalitarianism strongly underpins interpersonal values in Australia. People believe in the right to a ‘fair go’ regardless of a person’s background. It has often been described as a classless society as Australians tend not to think in terms of one person being better than another – rather, those who are privileged are simply acknowledged as ""better off"" than others. A person’s level of education and wealth does not necessarily earn them status or respect. Instead, it is acknowledged that they have an advantage or a leg up in life. Sociologists have argued that this dismissal of ', 'social stratification', ' arose out of the egalitarian beliefs that helped Australia transition from ', 'penal society', ' into an equal federation.', 'Broadly, there are not many social indicators that can define class distinctions in society. People with university degrees are not necessarily wealthier than those without, and affluent Australians also tend to prefer casual clothing most of the time. Furthermore, unlike in the UK, a person’s wealth, education and place of birth tends to not make a significant difference to their accent in Australia. The only substantial social conclusion able to be made from the way a person speaks is usually their age (through their use of specific slang).', 'Of course, Australia is not entirely ‘classless’. Social divisions do exist – particularly for the chronically unemployed and some marginalised populations. Society is also becoming arguably more stratified by competitiveness in the market economy. To this point, a 2015 study conducted by SBS found that Australians believe that they are more materialistic than ever before and also feel collectively guilty about it.', 'Relationships', 'Australian friendships run deep and are especially loyal. It is common for people to rely upon their friends or ‘mates’ in hard times more than family. Migrants and foreigners are often surprised by how openly and quickly Australians begin to establish the basis for this mateship. Moreover, relationships tend to be built on camaraderie rather than ', 'hierarchy', '. In this way, people tend to show respect to friends and peers through gestures of equality instead of deference. Considerable effort is put into being fair to everyone in social interactions. For example, it is considered bad taste to ask someone to do anything you would not do yourself. People who hold themselves in higher esteem than their mates are quickly reminded of their place. Furthermore, Australians tend to strongly dislike it when friends knowingly put them in awkward situations that oblige them to do something without having necessarily wanted or offered to. ‘Dobbing’ (reporting their misdemeanours to authorities) is also seen as unacceptable in a friendship.', 'Australians seem to have an implicit preference for those who seem down-to-earth and straightforward. They often perceive simplicity as an endearing personal quality; to be called a ""classic"" is a compliment among friends. On the other hand, people who exhibit strong signs of intellect or perhaps consider themselves ‘cultured’ are more likely to be approached with suspicion or even resentment. This is related to ', 'tall poppy syndrome', ' by which those who show signs of arrogance or achievement above their peers are swiftly cut down or diminished. In this way, humility is essential to social interaction.', 'Australians are often very modest about their accomplishments and commonly self-deprecate to avoid seeming pretentious. This can sometimes be taken to extreme lengths in social circles and workplaces. For example, people have been known to refuse national awards due to the alienation it might engender from their fellow Australians. Country leaders also tend to downplay their socio-economic status or educational prowess to appeal to the ‘true-blue Aussie’. Even the common descriptor, “the lucky country”, conveys modesty as the nation’s success is attributed to ‘luck’ rather than the work or competence of the Australian people.', 'Rules and Relaxation', 'Australia has many national narratives that idolise the ‘scallywag’ or ‘larrikin’ (such as Ned Kelly). These are underdog characters that show little regard for rules. Australians often express a light disregard for authority (especially in their humour). Nevertheless, most are very conscientious about following the rule of law. Society is circumscribed by a vast number of practical regulations that stringently control the behaviour of the Australian public. For example, cyclists can be fined hundreds of dollars for not wearing a helmet. Foreigners are often surprised to see how much of an emphasis is put on safety in a society often stereotyped as ‘laid-back’. Indeed, many Australians do find these regulations overly precautious or too tightly enforced by police. Those who criticise this aspect of Australian law and order dub themselves as living in a ""Nanny state"".', 'However, most people do generally maintain a relaxed approach about things. There is a cultural tendency towards procrastination in the way situations may be approached. For example, problems may be met with an answer of “she’ll be right” (just leave it, she will be okay in time without our intervention). Australians also tend to avoid putting themselves under pressure. They like to prioritise their energy, placing emphasis on relaxation, holidays and winding-down. Some may even find people who exert themselves a lot (in their eagerness, impatience, stress, etc.) to be exasperating. This reflects a cultural aversion from complaining, worrying too much, reflecting on mistakes and dwelling on the past. Instead, people are expected to have an easy-going, ‘can do’ attitude.', 'Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Experiences', 'The Indigenous people and nations of Australia are the traditional custodians of the land, having inhabited it for an estimated 60,000 years.

While much of this diversity remains, ', 'colonisation', ' has had devastating impacts on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities and their cultures. It is estimated the original population was reduced by approximately 90% after the British invasion of the continent.

The trauma of "", 'colonisation', ' remains difficult for many in the community to process – especially as some traditional knowledge and entire language groups were lost. Many continue to seek political redress through reconciliation and formal recognition of their status as the initial inhabitants of the continent. The marginalisation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people has persisted through institutional racism, assimilation and discrimination. By common statistical measures, the general population remains chronically disadvantaged – socially and economically. Almost every Aboriginal family has been directly affected in some way by the harsh realities of Australia’s post-colonial policies and practices.', 'Despite this adversity, many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people remain connected with their culture. Many have a deep affinity with their Indigenous identity and practice their culture in varying forms. Most Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities across different regions, languages and dialects share a common philosophy based on spirituality, ecology and consensual-communal organisation. This involves a custodial relationship to the land that many believe confirms their Indigenous identity.', 'Today, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people of Australia have been recognised as possessing the most ancient continuous culture on Earth. However, Aboriginal culture is not homogenous. There is an extensive mix of traditions, spiritualities and customs among today’s Indigenous population. The degree to which a person integrates traditional Indigneous cultural behaviours, beliefs or social codes into their lives also differs between individuals. Importantly, an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander person’s level of knowledge and personal practice of their culture does not define them as being any ‘more’ or ‘less’ Indigenous.', 'The cultures and worldviews of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders peoples are diverse, multifaceted and complex. We encourage readers to visit the ', 'Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Course', ' for more information on Australian Indigenous cultural diversity. For guidelines on how to sensitively refer to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, see ', 'Ot', 'her Considerations', '.', 'Multiculturalism in Australia', 'The Australian mainstream has generally adopted Anglo/Celtic-Western customs. However, this description is becoming less relevant for depicting modern society’s social make-up as many Australian households have a ', 'multicultural', ' identity. Whereas previously most immigrants came from Europe, many people are now arriving from Asia, Africa and the Americas. According to the 2016 census, roughly 26% of Australian residents were born overseas and 49% had at least one parent born overseas. In a recent SBS study on Australia’s social attitudes, most migrants identified themselves as Australian – with 76% thinking of themselves as at least part-‘Aussie’.', 'Most Australians accept multiculturalism and believe it to be the future of the country. However, a reactionary attitude has lingered as some people remain uncomfortable with divergences from a Western standard. This can be witnessed in the the debates that surround current immigration policies and politics. For example, a 2016 Essential Vision Poll found 49% of Australians support a ban on Muslim immigration.', 'However, outside of national politics, Australians generally treat and accept people of all backgrounds equally and may simply relate more to those whom they share similarities with. Australians have largely embraced the cultural diversity immigrants bring, and the country constantly draws upon these influences to build its own developing national character. SBS found that most Australians would agree that they ""are all immigrants to the land anyway"". This is exemplified in the way the majority of Australians continued to identify their heritage elsewhere in the world; in the 2011 census, only 33.7% of the population identified their ancestry as ‘Australian’.', 'Increasingly, a bi-cultural identity is being seen as an asset to be treasured and proud of in Australian society. The younger generation in particular, is becoming increasingly culturally aware with many seeing overseas experiences as a rite of passage towards maturity. Moreover, world travel is now a popular aspiration in the minds of most seeking more international exposure.

Its Melanesian culture is characterised by a tropical environment and relaxed pace of life. The Western influences of British colonialism have left a cultural imprint on the indigenous peoples and introduced new migrant populations into the society. Nevertheless, native traditions have remained strong amidst the social, political and technological changes that have occurred in the colonial and post-colonial ages.', 'Colonisation', 'Fiji was a colony of the British Crown from 1874 to 1970. European settlement of the Fijian islands proceeded in a different manner to what was experienced by many other territories, as the British made a greater effort to recognise the social ', 'hierarchy', ', language and culture of the native peoples when they established their relationship. For example, the local Fijian chieftain system of land and governance was not so different from the lord system of the UK. Thus, the British were able to incorporate these social structures more considerately as they colonised. In this sense, the relationship between the indigenous and non-indigenous Fijians is very different to what Australians are familiar with. Westerners are welcomed warmly, and rarely with suspicion. Some Fijians may continue to feel a personal obligation and honour to the British monarchy.', 'Ethnic Groups', 'Native Fijians (known simply as “Fijians”) are the majority people and their origins on the land are deeply respected. Fijians are often outstandingly proud of their identity and the status it holds in society. They tend to have a very secure sense of belonging in their community and culture. This inner confidence is perhaps what makes them such forthcoming people. Indeed, their welcoming hospitality and warmth can surpass feelings of awkwardness very quickly. Non-Fijians can find this both bold and refreshing in a social context.', 'While Fijians of indigenous heritage make up approximately 57% of the population, there are many ethnic groups of other ancestries (such as Indians, Chinese, Europeans, part-Europeans, Pacific Islanders and Rotumans). Indians are the second largest ethnic group in Fiji. Almost 60% of the Fijians living in Australia are Indo-Fijians. There is a diversity of subcultures within the Indo-Fijian ethnic group. Most people with Indian ancestry are descendants of indentured labourers that the British brought over from India during their colonial rule. They live in both the cities and rural areas. However, there are also groups of Gujaratis and Punjabi Indians that arrived separate to the colonial import of labourers. These groups tend to live in urban areas, owning shops as merchants or traders. They may also have closer cultural attachments to India and their kin. Generally, most Indo-Fijians have tended to continue practising the religious, familial and marital customs of their heritage.', 'During colonial times, Europeans adopted the highest class and considered the native Fijians (especially chiefs) to be superior to Indians. Ethnic relations between Fijians and Indo-Fijians are somewhat contentious due to the political aspirations of each group. Fijians assert their political predominance as the original people of the island; meanwhile, Indo-Fijians seek political equality and recognition. Nevertheless, the tensions of political power-dynamics are unlikely to affect people’s day-to-day interactions with one another. Broadly, Fijians of all backgrounds interact with ease. The distinctions between ethnic groups are more noticeable in their different cultural traditions, customs and religions.', 'Geographical Differences', 'Today the most visible differences in society are between the two main islands (Viti Levu and Vanua Levu) and the rest of the country. Viti and Vanua are the biggest islands to have been urbanised and the cities can look more Western than Melanesian in their architecture and design. The traditional social structure of native Fiji is not as common in these places as a commercially driven economy has risen.', '87% of the country is tribally owned native land upon which native culture continues to thrive. There is also often little or no communications infrastructure (i.e. internet, phone reception, etc.) in these rural areas of Fiji. The presence of the government is only really evident in educational and health care facilities, while the justice system is left largely to the community.', 'Inclusion and Social Organisation', 'Many Fijians continue to live in tribal villages headed by chiefs. He or she is in charge of disciplining those who have done wrong and maintaining harmonious relationships in the village. Tribes are generally large networks of close or distant ', 'kinship', ' ties. Thus, everyone in the village’s community is usually related in some way. Most commonly, the relations between families (or clans) are through patrilineal heritage or marriage. However, as an example of the generous spirit of Melanesian culture, if an outsider accepts the standards of a tribe, they may be accepted and receive the benefits and rights of that family. In this way, they may become honorary ‘brothers’ and ‘sisters’ of a village. This familial emphasis within villages gives a very communal understanding of “home” and “family” as encompassing more than just a ', 'nuclear family', ' and their house, but the entire tribe and their village. As an outsider, it is important to appreciate these intimate relationships and recognise that villages are, in fact, private places. Though much village activity is done outdoors or ‘publicly’, the ‘public’ usually consists of family.', 'Within these villages, economic property or resources are shared and social organisation is very communal. For example, children may be raised up by the collective effort of a community. The traditional cultural idea that ‘nothing is really yours until you have shared it’ pervades. Therefore, behaviours that exhibit ', 'materialism', ' or ownership – whether it is of objects, resources or people – are commonly rejected. By the custom of ', 'kerekere', ', any relative or neighbour can request a favour or ask for something that they need and it will be willingly provided without any underlying expectation of repayment. In this way, the Fijian character is often extremely generous and inclusive. People temper their jealousy from a young age and are instead taught to offer and share everything they are given.', 'It is understood that when people share amongst the community, no person will have to go unloved or uncared for. A sense of personal belonging and economic security is provided for all. This stability of the supply of food and resources is particularly important in those villages that continue a subsistence-farming lifestyle. However, on the other hand, the collectivist culture puts many indigenous Fijians at a disadvantage when they move to the urban areas; they often have a major struggle adjusting to the competitive spirit of the capitalist economy. Nevertheless, this orientation towards inclusion influences Fijians to be very gentle in their demeanour and also very conscious of their neighbourly relationships.', 'Religion and Fatalism', 'The warmth and humbleness of Fijian culture can be somewhat attributed to the society’s strong devotion to faith. Almost all Fijians are religious and actively observant. Therefore, a well-developed sense of gratitude and servitude (to one’s community and God) has become a familiar feature of the Fijian character. Most people also have a multi-faith understanding as Christians, Muslims, Hindus, Sikhs and Buddhists coexist peacefully. People generally respect the important role one’s spirituality plays in their lives and are very tolerant.', 'Some sociologists have suggested that Fijians’ trust in God has contributed to the fatalistic nature of the culture. Indeed, there is a relaxed attitude among Fijian society that it is possible to leave time, events and outcomes up to destiny and trust they will come to fruition at some point. This means people can be submissive and may expect things to work out eventually without necessarily investing the attention to make sure they do so. For example, one hears “', 'sega na leqa', '” (the equivalent to “no worries”) as a response to problems or complaints quite often.', 'Daily activity is also approached patiently with more time devoted to personal interactions. People don’t tend to rush and instead follow ‘Fiji time’ to suit the tropical climate. For Westerners, this can be a particular cultural challenge to negotiate. The Fijian business sector is not very tightly organised and schedules are not closely followed. Fijians tend to structure their lives around the immediate social relationships important to them. They are generally very attentive to their relationships, observing the experience of their friends and family carefully to attend to each other’s needs and feelings. From this, the inclusive people-focus of Fijian culture can be seen.']"

In 1840, the Treaty of Waitangi was signed to establish and guide the relationship between the Crown in New Zealand and Māori. However, the process of ', 'colonisation', ' caused widespread violence and dispossessed many Māori of their land, fracturing and marginalising communities and cultural identities.', 'Since the ', 'colonisation', ' of New Zealand, mass immigration has dramatically changed the social demographics of the population and established a western European cultural mainstream.

New Zealanders (also known as Kiwis) are often viewed as being friendly, inventive, outgoing and welcoming people. They are generally calm and may initially seem slightly more reserved and polite in comparison to other English-speakers. However, their culture is still highly informal and relaxed. The 2015 Global Peace Index identified the country as the fourth safest in the world. A strong sense of security combined with relative social and economic prosperity has provided many New Zealanders with an optimistic outlook on the freedom and possibilities around them.', 'There is a strong individualistic streak that underpins New Zealand’s culture. The do-it-yourself spirit encourages self-reliance, inventiveness and bravery. Many national narratives celebrate courageous Kiwis overcoming adverse odds. However, the idolisation of achievement is tempered by the love of the underdog. Those who excel too much or show arrogance are likely to be resented and swiftly cut down with ridicule. This phenomenon, commonly known as ', 'tall poppy syndrome', ', leads humility to be highly valued in social interaction. As such, New Zealanders tend to be modest about their accomplishments and often self-deprecate to avoid seeming pretentious.', ""New Zealand is geographically isolated in the Pacific Ocean, and this can provide a sense of removal from pressing global political issues. Nevertheless, its people are very globally minded and most have a strong aspiration to travel. It has become almost a rite of passage for people to gain overseas experience, with many taking advantage of easy migration opportunities to the UK or Australia. As of 2016, it is estimated over one million or 14.1% of New Zealand's native-born population were living abroad, giving it the second highest "", 'diaspora', ' in the ', 'OECD', '.', '1', 'New Zealanders generally see themselves as being open-minded towards new ideas, difference and change. Most Kiwis are proud of their country’s historically prevailing liberal social attitudes (for example, New Zealand was the first country in the world to give women the right to vote). Largely, New Zealanders try to be accepting and tolerant of most differences. Society is underpinned by strong egalitarian beliefs that everyone should have the equal opportunity to better their circumstances regardless of their background. People who are financially successful are not viewed as being better than anyone else – rather, those who are privileged are simply acknowledged as better off than others. As such, whilst there are social stratifications among the wealthy, the middle-income earners and the poor, there is no formal class structure in society. A person’s level of education and wealth does not necessarily earn them status or respect; instead it is simply acknowledged that they have an advantage or a ‘leg up in life’. Thus, people from different social brackets tend to interact quite easily with each other.', 'Visible social differences in society generally correlate with ', 'ethnicity', '; the indigenous people of New Zealand (Māori) and Pacific Islanders are still significantly disadvantaged compared to the white majority. People who identify as Māori are more likely to earn less, have poorer health standards and economic standards of living. Māori and Pacific Islanders also make up a disproportionate amount of the imprisoned population. The majority of non-Māori Pacific Islanders came from the Cook Islands, Samoa, Tonga, Tokelau and Fiji. They tend to live in or around the main cities and usually migrate for employment or family reasons. Another significant ethnic population in New Zealand is the Asian population (mainly from specific countries such as China and India) that has steadily migrated – mostly for economic reasons.', 'One may argue that racial tensions are less pronounced in New Zealand than Australia because the indigenous/non-indigenous relationship developed slightly differently. It should be noted, unlike the Aboriginal population of Australia, the Māori people share the same language and have relatively similar customs. This is not to say their culture is homogenous, but different tribes had enough collective similarities to allow them to maintain a relatively solid sense of their history and cultural knowledge despite the fracturing caused by ', 'colonisation', "". Hence, indigenous culture has been integrated more visibly into New Zealand's mainstream society than it has in Australia. For example, the Māori language is an official language of the country and is taught within the school curriculum. New Zealand English contains many Māori words that are in common use."", 'Mainstream society has developed a degree of reverence, acceptance and understanding of the indigenous heritage of the country. Most New Zealanders of all backgrounds feel moved and proud when they see their nation represented by Māori on the global stage. Furthermore, this has encouraged more Māori to feel pride and honour in their identity, and to recognise that disadvantages associated with their ', 'ethnicity', ' are externally caused. Sociologists have argued that Māori’s pride in their culture and history has made New Zealanders of European descent less assertive and entitled (in comparison to Australians).', 'Something that unites New Zealanders is their love of the natural beauty of their land. Foreigners are usually struck by how proud they are of their country’s incredible landscape and environment. There is a strong social and political will to preserve the natural environment. Influenced by the indigenous world view, some New Zealanders believe that all aspects of the ecosystem have a ', 'mauri', ' (life force) and damage to this mauri – by attempts to dominate or extort the land – causes the land and its people to lose energy and vitality.', 'A second common bond in society is through the pride of place in the public imagination that the national rugby team (the All Blacks) command.

Traditionally, the Māori have a warrior-like identity and a very strong connection with their spirituality. While Māori have been influenced by Europeans, modernised with the technological age and also Christianised, many keep their culture alive. The traditional language is still widely spoken throughout New Zealand and ceremonies are celebrated by the nation. Some core concepts of Māori culture are ', 'mana', ', ', 'tapu', ' and ', 'utu', '.', 'Mana is the Māori concept that represents power and prestige. It can be gained through demonstration of authority (i.e. winning a contested piece of land), age, association (i.e. being the grandson of someone prestigious) or by having a wealth of resources that you can use to influence others. Respect of mana drives hierarchical relationships. Traditionally, Māori proudly defended their mana through their actions or would try to enhance it through grandiose responses to situations.', 'Tapu is a Polynesian concept that refers to something being so sacred it is untouchable. Something that is tapu should not be used, interfered with, or in some cases even spoken of. For example, a tribe that holds a particular belief in a lake they grew up around may consider it tapu and prevent people from fishing it. There are many places and things in New Zealand under this spiritual protection that one should be aware of. Burial grounds are particularly sacred.', 'Utu is loosely defined as revenge but is traditionally much more. It is the notion of reciprocation and balanced exchange that Māori follow. Historically, they often gave gifts or demanded items as compensation for past events. Today, it continues as the cultural idea that everything has to be put right.', 'Many traditional cultural concepts are still understood and practised by Māori today – however, usually in a modified, modern form. For example, relationships were once particularly hierarchical with a strongly patriarchal culture. This has changed as gender equality is acknowledged and respect of female authority and opinion has become the expectation. Māori women commonly hold positions of power. However, women’s involvement in traditionally male-only ceremonies is still determined between members of those tribes.', 'The younger generation of Māori have become more aware of their culture as the New Zealand government has encouraged funding to maintain the language and culture. Non-Māori may have difficulty comprehending the culture and traditional spirituality as it is very holistic and many tenets are based on legends that have flexible notions of time (hard for Westerners to conceptualise).', 'Māori often like to come together in the greater community to strengthen and maintain links to cultural traditions. Generally, they are a more collectivistic people than other New Zealanders as their culture places a high value on loyalty and belonging to their tribe. As a result, they tend to be very family-oriented. In Australia, Māori who are separated from their family overseas tend to adopt other Māori who are not directly related and become ‘one big family’. Traditional Māori would define themselves first by their family (', 'whānau', '), then by their sub-tribe (', 'hapu', '), and then by the larger tribe (', 'iwi', ') and its geographical territory.', 'Generally, the Māori are more reserved than other New Zealanders in their demeanour. They are often recognised as being hard-working, calm, patient and good-humoured people. Traditional or older Māori may be less likely to verbalise their feelings, tending to internalise things towards a spiritual understanding of situations. Māori are also usually very hospitable. Largely, they are exceptionally generous and accommodating to their guests, often trying very hard to mask the inconvenience of doing so.', 'For some Māori living in Australia and other countries, the homesickness of moving to and living in a new country heightens their sense of Māori identity and ignites a desire to embrace their roots and culture.

There are over 600 islands and roughly 830 languages spoken throughout the country. Moreover, the indigenous population encompasses several thousand separate communities, each with their own language, customs and traditions. The common ethnic categories in Papua New Guinea are Melanesian, Papuan, Negrito, Micronesian and Polynesian. It seems\xa0‘Papua New Guinean’ is more accurately described as a linguistic group rather than an ', 'ethnicity', '. In recent decades, significant efforts have been undertaken to unify the Papua New Guinean people under a national identity.', 'Identity and Wantok', 'In the ', 'postcolonial', ' period (following 1975), the formalisation of a national language was pivotal in helping formulate a unified Papua New Guinean identity. Among the vast linguistic differences between many of the country’s communities, ‘', 'Tok Pisin', '’ (‘talk pidgin’) became recognised as an official language. In contemporary Papua New Guinea, Tok Pisin is a symbol of national identity as well as the preferred means of communication. State-sponsored efforts to construct a unified identity through the means of language have been successful. However, generally only some of the educated elite have started to feel significant attachment to the nation and national pride.', 'One’s ancestry, kin group and place of birth remain fundamental to how an individual understands their identity. Papua New Guineans primarily relate their identity to their ‘', 'wantok', '’ (‘one talk’). A wantok is a person’s ', 'clan', ' group or specific language group that they generally share ', 'kinship', ' ties with. Nowadays, the term is increasingly used to describe people’s social networks. For example, modern wantok networks may be based on language, geography, ', 'kinship', ' or personal connections. Individuals tend to be extremely loyal to these kin groups. Indeed, one’s wantok provides a social safety net for individuals and a sense of belonging.', 'Attempts to categorise the various social groups can be confusing as the traditional groups have evolved in response to changes over time. However, the oral tradition of passing down stories remains an important way to remember ancestry for some kin groups and communities. Some communities have been engaged in feuds with their neighbours for centuries in light of their linguistic and cultural differences. These feuds of ages past are no longer holding as much significance given that over half the population is 24 years old or under (approximately 54% according to the 2000 census data).', 'Collectivism', 'There are various ways ', 'collectivism', ' manifests within Papua New Guinean culture. For example, individual land ownership is typically uncommon. Tenure to land is group based, with people perceiving their rights to land as a result of membership by birth into a ', 'group', ' or through some relationship to the group.', 'Another example is the way in which the notion of reciprocity plays a central role in forming and maintaining relationships. Assistance to others comes with the expectation that something of equal value is owed and will be returned. If someone does not reciprocate, they are frowned upon by others. There is an expectation that members from the same wantok will be willing and available to help one another. However, since reciprocity is nearly always expected but not always possible, barriers may be put up between individuals of differing income levels. Common ways Papua New Guineans engage in the reciprocity system is through the sharing of food.', 'Village and Town', 'The village–town distinction affects the everyday experiences of many Papua New Guineans. The majority of the population live in villages, deriving their livelihood from farming. In these communities division of labour is determined based on gender and age. Meanwhile, labour in towns and cities is typically divided in accordance with specialisation. The common perception associated with the village–town distinction is a division between the ‘elites’ and the ‘grassroots’. The ‘elites’ are considered to be those who are educated and higher-income earners. Conversely, the ‘grassroots’ are thought to be villagers and the lower-income earners in town. Social interaction between these two ‘groups’ can be tense. However, distinctions of wealth based on place are deceptive since those living in villages are not necessarily poor.', 'This village-town division is becoming less prominent with the emergence of a middle class. Moreover, education and exposure to Western culture has led many of the younger generation out of the villages and into the towns seeking employment. The increase in internal migration of many rural migrants towards towns has sparked the creation of shantytowns known as ‘settlements’.', 'It is also important to note that these experiences are not necessarily universal. ', 'Colonisation', ' and development happened unevenly throughout the islands, with some areas resisting ', 'colonisation', ' more than others, while some areas experienced development before others. Thus, the village–town distinction is not only more prominent in some areas, but also a dynamic that is constantly shifting.', 'Big Man', 'The status of ‘', 'big man', '’ is well known throughout Papua New Guinean culture. The term is akin to ‘respectable’ or ‘wealthy’ man. A big man is distinguished from chiefs and other traditional leadership roles. The position denotes leadership, power and influence that is usually earned through demonstrating their ability to acquire and share property and other goods with their kin or wantok. While this understanding of big man is still common, the concept is being expanded in light of the changes in society.', 'Big man in contemporary society is commonly used to describe a business person or politician who sustains their position of leadership through providing resources and patronage to their constituents, such as their wantok. While most of the microsocieties in Papua New Guinea approach decision making on a consensual basis, it is the big man who shapes the consensus. Frequently, men in significant positions of power, such as members of parliament, are often big men in their own wantok, or a close relative of a big man. In bigger cities, these structures may be hidden yet remain significant factors in interactions between people.', 'The concepts described above, such as wantok and big man, are often more influential than formal institutions and rules in Papua New Guinea. However, it should be reiterated that the dynamics of these informal networks vary between communities. Papua New Guinea is extremely diverse in terms of geography, language, ', 'ethnicity', ', traditions and colonial development.

Samoan is closely related to Maori, Tahitian, Hawaiian and Tongan languages. While it is not necessarily mutually intelligible with the other dialects, many words are identical or similar.

The Samoan language is a cherished symbol of cultural identity for many Samoans.', 'Fa’a Samoa', 'The term ‘', 'fa’a\xa0Samoa', '’ translates into English as ‘the Samoan Way’. Fa’a Samoa refers to a complex cultural code that guides and teaches individuals on how to lead their life. Samoan culture is governed by various protocols and etiquette (see the ', 'Etiquette', ' section), all in accordance with core values within fa’a Samoa such as family, language, the environment, ', 'genealogy', ', the arts (including tattooing) and political and social structures. Although some Samoan values and customs have changed since the country came into contact with Europe, Samoans continue to strive to preserve fa’a Samoa. For example, Christian values and beliefs that were brought to the island in the 19th century have been integrated into fa’a Samoa. Adhering to fa’a Samoa brings a sense of pride and respect as well as social cohesion within the Samoan community.', 'Fa’a Samoa is holistic, meaning that Samoan culture is often understood as encompassing nearly all facets of life. For many, adhering to fa’a Samoa is closely associated with honouring one’s family. Genealogies and legends are often passed down and elaborated through the generations. The sharing of one’s ancestry is important to many, as Samoans often perceive their identity through their family and genealogies. The way in which one honours their family varies depending on their relationship and status with others. For example, Samoans abroad will often send remittances to family members in Samoa as a way to maintain family connections and respect for one another.', 'Social Structure and Matai', 'Samoan society is based on a collectivist system of governance known as\xa0‘', 'fa’a\xa0Matai’', '. In this system, society is organised by extended families (', 'aiga', '), with each family having its own ‘', 'Matai’', ' (‘chief’ or ‘leader’) titles that are connected to certain districts, villages and plots of family land. Individuals in the aiga are expected to be generous with their possessions and prioritise the interests of the group or community over their own. For example, people tend to be communal and share their goods rather than prizing their individual ownership. Matai are responsible for administrative duties and maintaining traditions and customs of the village. Matai are also seen as spiritual caretakers of all those who fall under their authority. The status of Matai is highly respected among the community.', 'Generally, there are two types of Matai, each with different duties. The first is the high chief of the country, village or family – known as the Ali’i. The Ali’i are often understood as ‘sitting chiefs’ because they are typically responsible for the most important aspects of Samoan culture and are generally the decision-makers. The second type of matai are the Tulafale, the talking chiefs, who usually fulfil the many oral traditions and duties within fa’a Samoa. The Tulafale are often known as the mouthpieces of the Ali’i and are expected to be skilled in the art of ', 'lauga', ' (oration).', 'A Samoan becomes the Matai of a village through the complex and sophisticated hierarchical Matai system, which includes an election by consensus. While the nuances of the Matai system are difficult to articulate, the title of Matai is generally passed down from parent to child or given based on the view that the recipient will best serve the family or village. The Matai was traditionally male, but nowadays women can gain leadership status. Closely related to the role of the Ali’i is the Taupou. To be a Taupou, the woman is generally connected to the family or village by blood and is the daughter of an Ali’i.', 'The role of a Matai is based on one’s ability to serve those around them rather than seek prestige. Matai are expected to ensure the family or village is self-sufficient and well-nourished, as well as maintaining social order among all members. Indeed, Samoan society tends to be meritocratic, whereby those with a recognised ability are often elected to the leadership of families and villages. Matai tend to gain status and influence through accumulating resources as well as their ability to mobilise and redistribute them. Since the introduction of a cash economy following contact with Europeans, the power of Matai has been reduced. Nonetheless, the fa’a Matai system persists as an integral part of fa’a Samoa.', 'Tatau (Tattoo)', '‘', 'Tatau', '’ refers to tattoos or the art of tattooing. Christian missionaries in the 19th century attempted to eliminate the practice of tattooing from many Polynesian islands. However, Samoans maintained the tradition. Once a part of traditional Samoan culture, the tatau is undergoing a strong revival in contemporary Samoa. Traditionally, a tatau was a symbol of one’s status and social rank as well as a rite of passage from adolescence to adulthood. Typically, it was only Matai who would possess a tatau. While these meanings continue today, tattooing is also often seen in contemporary Samoan society as a sign of dedication and pride towards one’s family, regardless of their status in society.', 'Most people will visit a local ', 'tufuga', '(tattoo artist) in their early adult years to gain their tatau. The individual will tell the tufuga about themselves, their family and their ancestry. From there, the artist will design a tatau. The process of creating a tatau is often prolonged and painful, sometimes taking a few months to complete. Each tatau is unique, containing geometrical patterns and embedded symbols as well as carrying special meanings for the wearer of the tatau.', 'For Matai, there are two kinds of gender-specific tatau for male and female. For men, the tatau is referred to as ', 'pe’a', ', which contains intricate geometrical patterns covering areas from the waist to the knees. For women, the tatau is called ', 'malu', ' and it covers the legs from the upper thighs to the knees. For people who aren’t Matai, the position of the tatau can vary, with common places being on the arm. Nearly all tatau relate to an individual’s ancestry; thus, it is believed that by wearing the tatau, one is respecting and upholding their family and heritage.', 'Geography and Lifestyle', 'There tends to be a distinction between the urban and village areas in Samoa. Most Samoans have lived in coastal villages and continue to do so, with about four-fifths of the population located in rural areas. In the village area, local law prevails, which can vary from village to village. Conversely, Apia (the capital city) contains approximately one-fifth of Samoa’s population. Most of those who live in the cities like Apia often move to earn more money for their families and communities. For many, living in the city is temporary as they often intend to return to their village later. While village and city life differ in terms of work and lifestyle, there are general similarities across both settings. For example, many Samoan families wake up early and begin the day with a prayer, followed by preparation for their work or school day.', 'Daily Interactions and Respect', 'Samoans are typically friendly and warm people who offer smiles to those they meet. Various values that underpin daily interactions are considered to be a part of ', 'fa’a\xa0Samoa', '. For example, being hospitable to friends, family and new acquaintances is very common and valued. Cooperation and consensus are also common principles that influence interactions with others. Many will socialise with their family and friends on a regular basis, particularly on Sundays after attending church services.', 'Respect, known in Samoan as ‘', 'fa’aaloalo’', ' is highly valued. The importance of fa’aaloalo is evident in a number of ways. For example, youth are expected to defer to elders and those of higher status. Another example is ', 'gagana\xa0fa’aaloalo,', ' which refers to special vocabulary that is used when speaking respectfully, particularly when addressing a Matai. While most Samoans uphold rules and traditions underpinning ', 'fa’a\xa0Samoa', ', Samoan families living abroad may have a more relaxed approach towards cultural protocols.', '', '1\xa0Central Intelligence Agency, 20162 Central Intelligence Agency, 2016']"

With ', 'Samoa', ' and Hawai’i to the north and ', 'New Zealand', ' to the south, Tonga is part of the countries and cultures that make up Polynesia. For centuries during the early modern period, Tonga was politically and culturally influential throughout Polynesia. Its people were particularly known for their warrior abilities and navigation skills. The Tongan empire had collapsed by the time the first Europeans made contact with the islands in the late 1700s and early 1800s. Although Tonga was influenced by European contact, especially Christian missionary activity, the country remained sovereign. In 1970, Tonga was granted full independence from voluntary protectorate status under Britain.', 'Although aspects of the traditional culture have changed due to interactions with the English-speaking West, Tongans continually find ways to uphold the Tongan way of life ', '(angafakatonga)', '. For example, many Tongans place a high value on their families, paying respect to those of seniority and maintaining oral traditions of storytelling. Modern-day Tongans are often friendly, warm and hospitable people who prioritise positive social interactions over worrying about the future.', 'Ethnicity and Language', ""The vast majority of the population identify as ethnic Tongans (97% as of 2016) and are of Polynesian descent.1 Thus, they are ethnically related to Samoans, Tuvaluans and more distantly related to Māori and native Hawaiians. This shared Polynesian heritage is reflected in the culture, such as the primacy of oral traditions and social structures. There is also some Melanesian influence in Tonga due to the country's contact with Fiji. The minority of the population who are not ethnic Tongans include small numbers of other Pacific Islanders, part-Tongans and Europeans. Society is generally free of ethnic tension, mainly as a result of the "", 'homogeneity', ' and intermarriage that has blurred distinctive ethnic boundaries.', 'The primary spoken and official language in Tonga is Tongan, an Oceanic language. Tongan is the most commonly heard language in public places, such as markets, schools, offices and churches. Due to the country’s seventy years as a British protectorate, English is also widespread throughout Tonga and continues to be taught in primary and most high schools.', 'Geography, Land and Migration', 'Tonga is an archipelago consisting of over 170 islands, 36 of which are inhabited. There are four major island groups: Tongatapu, Ha’apai, Vava’u and Niua. Most of the population is located on Tongatapu, with most people living in small towns or villages. However, the urban population is steadily growing. Most villages surround an empty area, referred to as ', 'mala’e', ', which is used for social gatherings and events. Many families in Tonga own plots of land dedicated to subsistence farming to grow their foods and spend a bit of time each day tending to their crops.', 'Every citizen above age 16 is entitled to lease land from the government for a small sum of money. However, the growing population and the concentration of people in urban areas has made it increasingly difficult for people to exercise this constitutional right. Land titles are passed down through the eldest son. Most people who live in larger towns were originally from smaller villages or towns and moved to earn more money for their families. This is usually a temporary move, with many intending to return to their village later.', 'In recent years, Tongans have been moving abroad to countries such as Australia, New Zealand and the United States in hopes of gaining better employment opportunities. It is common for such migrants to send remittances to their families in Tonga. Indeed, this has become one of the primary sources of income for Tongan families.1 Intermarriage with foreigners has also become more common in recent decades.', 'The Tongan Way and Tongan Identity', 'The concept of ', ""‘angafakatonga' "", '(the ‘Tongan way’ or ‘Tongan custom’) is an important part of the Tongan identity and encompasses all Tongan values, practices, beliefs and behaviours. In the Tongan way, one’s connections to the Christian church and one’s family are of utmost importance.', 'There are some elements typically identified as deeply important to ', 'angafakatonga', '. One important element is Tonga’s social structure, which is highly stratified and status-conscious (see ', 'Tongan Social Heirarchy', '\xa0below). Generally speaking, those of lower status are expected to demonstrate respect ', '(faka’apa’apa)', '\xa0and unwavering obedience towards those of higher status. Talking back ', '(taungutu)', ' to those of higher status or age is generally not acceptable. Gender differences and family structure are also important elements of ', 'angafakatonga', ', with men and women expected to fulfil designated roles and behaviours (see ', 'Gender Roles', ' in ', 'Family', ').', 'Oral traditions and practices are still conducted in many Tongan villages. Genealogies, religious epics, proverbs, myths, poetry, fables and other forms of literature are often passed down and elaborated through generations. Fulfilling oral traditions and duties is often seen as compliance with ', 'angafakatonga', ' (the Tongan way). The sharing of one’s ancestry is particularly important, as many Tongans perceive their identity through their family and genealogies (see ', 'Genealogy', '\xa0in ', 'Family', ' for more information).', 'Western Influences on the Tongan Way', 'Anga\xa0fakatonga', ' is holistic, meaning that the Tongan way is often understood as encompassing nearly all facets of life.

For instance, though Tonga youth are generally proud of their heritage, some first-generation Tongan migrants may attempt to distance themselves from what they consider to be the ‘traditional' culture of Tonga. For them, agricultural practices are associated with a hard life and low income, whereas education and urban or foreign employment are seen as a way to rise above such a lifestyle."", 'Perceived differences between ', 'angafakatonga', ' (the Tongan way) and ', 'anga\xa0fakapālangi', ' (the Western way) have also made an impression on family relations. For many, adhering to the Tongan way is closely associated with honouring and preserving connections to their family and heritage. However, with modern technologies and the changing perspectives of Tongan youth, interactions with family and interest in genealogies are not as prevalent as they once were. This has led some to question what it personally means to be Tongan.', 'Although Tongan culture may be understood as a complex blend of ', 'angafakatonga', ' (the Tongan way) and ', 'anga\xa0fakapālangi', ' (the Western way), the Tongan way is still highly regarded and respected by many Tongans. ', 'Anga\xa0fakatonga', ' is often understood as the element of Tongan culture that makes it distinct from its Polynesian neighbours and the English-speaking West.', 'Tongan Social Hierarchy', 'Gender is the primary determinant of one’s position in the social and familial ', 'hierarchy', ' in Tonga. Women are highly respected, as demonstrated through familial interactions (see ', 'Gender Roles', ' in ', 'Family', ' for more information). After gender, the second determinant of ', 'hierarchy', ' is age. For example, a 15-year-old girl may have a higher social position than her brother of 20 years old. Therefore, Tonga can be thought of as a matriarchal society.', 'In addition to these two determinants of one’s social ', 'hierarchy', ', there is a structured class system based on the prestige of one’s family. In this social structure, there is a separation between ideas of one’s ‘social status’ and one’s ‘societal rank’. Social status is the position one inherits from their father, while societal rank is the position one inherits from their mother. ‘Status’ governs the relationships within the kin group, whilst ‘societal rank’ governs relationships across the broader society as a whole. However, these nuances in social position are only important within situations where everyone is already familiar with one another or their family. In contemporary Tonga, there are three social status categories: royalty, noble and commoner.', 'The most noticeable time for people’s social statuses and ranks to inform their interactions is at formal social occasions, such as funerals or weddings. In these settings, one can observe how the social structure prescribes people’s actions depending on their class. For instance, the highest noble male would be required to prepare the earth oven ', '(umu)', ' at his paternal aunt’s funeral to demonstrate deference to her. However, even then, the two principles would determine the person’s position differently depending on whether the event is within the kin group, a village or Tongan society as a whole.', 'From this, one can see that people in Tonga are very aware of their own social standing as well as that of everyone around them. However, one’s rank and status generally does not affect daily interactions. Members of the older generation may be more inclined to openly discuss their titles while the younger generation may not emphasise status and rank during informal interactions. People may also be expected to show deference and respect through communication. Despite the highly hierarchical nature of Tongan society, there is generally no major stratification or social exclusion on the basis on one’s position.', 'Collectivism and Reciprocity', 'Tongan society is also collectivistic, meaning that Tongans tend to be group-oriented and interdependent with one another. ', 'Individualism', ', whereby an individual prioritises their personal interests over the group’s, is mostly looked down upon. There is a general expectation that a person will share their success with the members of their immediate and extended family. In Tonga, people typically perceive having enough to share with others as a blessing. A primary example is food; it is polite to share food with others while eating alone ', '(kai\xa0po)', ' is considered rude. The term ', '‘kai\xa0po', '’ is also often used to describe a person as selfish or sneaky.', 'Relaxed Lifestyle and Outlook', 'Tongans tend to have a relaxed, gentle and friendly attitude towards life. As the Tongan proverb ', '“oua\xa0lau e kafo kae lau e lava”', "" (“stay positive and count your blessings”) expresses, Tongans are often thankful and forward-looking people. There is a general attitude that ‘what could be done today, could be done tomorrow'. This sentiment towards time is not considered lazy but rather an expression of a less worried approach to life. Moreover, people tend to prioritise the present moment over concerns of the future. With this comes the belief that one's attention should be oriented towards spending time with family and friends. As a result, many Tongans are incredibly hospitable, generous and find hastiness during social interactions to be rude."", 'Tongans are also highly respectful people, with emphasis placed on modesty and humility ', '(loto to)', "". Many Tongans may avoid outward signs of wealth or affection, dress in modest ways and be highly receptive to other people's behaviour.

The country is filled with diverse landscapes such as plains, forests, deserts, mountains and thousands of kilometres of ocean shoreline. Argentine culture is a blend of European customs and Latin American and indigenous traditions. Argentines are quite proud of their nation and its blended heritage as well as their ability to rise above adversity. They are also proud of their talents in many fields. For example, Argentina has produced five Nobel Laureates in the fields of Peace, Chemistry, and Medicine along with various creators in the arts. Although Argentines tend to be more individualistic than their counterparts in neighbouring countries, family networks and support continue to be a core part of Argentine society.', 'Geography and Space', 'Argentina can be grouped geographically into four main regions: the Andes, the North, the Pampas and Patagonia. However, the geographic distinction that Argentines are most aware of is between rural and urban areas. The vast majority of the country lives in urban areas of the country (approximately 92% as of 2017), and about one-third of the population lives in the Greater Buenos Aires region, located in the Pampas.', 'The urban-rural distinction is primarily between those in the rural interior (', 'provincias\xa0del interior', ') and those along the urban coast – the ‘', 'bonaerenses', '’ (the broader province of Buenos Aires). More specifically, the term ‘', 'porteños', ""' refers to the ‘people of the port' or those who are from the capital Buenos Aires. These divisions between the rural and urban population have become an ongoing topic of debate in Argentine politics. Many residents of rural areas have developed a sense of resentment towards the wealth, political power and proud demeanour of the porteños. At the same time, some porteños look upon those who reside in the rural interior as impoverished. However, rural people often take pride in the management of daily life among friends and neighbours. Indeed, those from rural areas usually desire to make a visitor’s stay enjoyable and pleasant. This sense of warmth and hospitality is also found among porteños."", 'Although modernisation in transport and industry has reduced regional differences, it is still common for people’s home regions to play a key role in their outlook and self-image. For instance, those from urban areas tend to be more cosmopolitan and informal. Many urbanites are proud of their European heritage, and some may consider themselves superior to their rural counterparts. By contrast, Argentines residing in rural parts of the country tend to be more conservative and traditional and will often communicate formally.', 'Colonisation and Ethnic Composition', 'The country has been heavily influenced by Spanish ', 'colonisation', ' that began in the 16th century. Argentina declared independence in 1816 after almost 300 years of colonial rule. Thereafter, many Argentine nationalists were instrumental to independence movements throughout the continent. Although the country has been independent for over 200 years, the colonial impact on the ethnic makeup, religious landscape and culture of Argentine society remains visible. For example, the Spanish introduced Roman Catholicism to the country, and it is still the dominant religion of Argentina.', 'A wave of European migration between the mid-1800s and early 1900s also had a massive impact on the ethnic composition of the country. The vast majority of migrants came from Italy and Spain. Italian migrants had a notable influence on Argentine culture. There were also smaller numbers of migrants from France, Poland, Germany, Russia and Britain. Today, approximately 97.2% of Argentina’s population have an ethnic connection to Europe.', 'Spanish is the national language of Argentina, yet the local language has absorbed many words from Italian. There are also a variety of accents associated with each region. One distinctive accent is the\xa0porteño\xa0accent, found in Buenos Aires. This accent has influences from Italian, and it incorporates slang expressions known as\xa0‘', 'lunfardo', '’.', 'Political Changes of the 20th Century', ""A political and social movement known as Justicialism or Perónism emerged in Argentina when Juan Perón became president of the country in 1946. Motivated by ideas of social justice, economic independence and political sovereignty, Perón implemented a series of reforms in the financial and labour sectors in Argentina. Perónism had a vast influence on Argentine politics, which is still present. The movement eventually led to a severe downturn in the country's economy and Perón was sent into exile in 1955. Perón returned in 1973 and was successful in his bid to become president of Argentina again."", 'Simultaneously, the late 1960s and early 1970s of Argentine history were marked by pervasive anti-government sentiments and riots throughout the country. The death of Perón in mid-1974 led to further fragmentation of the society. Argentina was ruled by right-wing military and security forces from 1976 to 1983. Some Argentines refer to this period as the ‘', 'Guerra Sucia', ""' (‘Dirty War') while others prefer to call it ‘"", 'La Dictadura', '’ (‘The Dictatorship’). Argentines who call it the ‘Guerra Sucia’ tend to be those who supported the military rule. On the other hand, people who refer to the era as ‘La Dictadura’ view the military rule as an abuse of power. During this period, people who were suspected of being left-aligned or part of left-wing guerrilla groups that emerged in the early 1960s were targeted by the military and were arrested, tortured, raped and killed. Human-rights groups estimate that during this time, approximately 30,000 people were abducted, detained and killed, many of whom had no association with left-wing guerrilla or activist groups.', 'Since the era of Perón and the last dictatorship, Argentina has gone through numerous political changes and upheavals, such as entering a war with Great Britain over the Falkland Islands, the restoration of ', 'democracy', ' and massive changes to the country’s economy. This tumultuous political history has deeply affected many Argentines, resulting in a cultural tendency to avoid uncertainty and ambiguity. Indeed, many approach life one day at a time. When making decisions, they tend to draw on lessons from the past and focus on the present context. Argentines also tend to communicate indirectly and avoid conflict in their day-to-day lives. This can be partly attributed to the desire for peaceful relationships after such a turbulent history. However, at the same time, Argentines have learnt the importance of dissent and political activism. Many are willing to voice their concerns through participation in protests and public demonstrations. For the most part, these forms of resistance have remained peaceful.', 'Argentine Identity', 'For many Argentines, national and cultural identity is a complex matter. For some, the national identity of Argentina is a blend of indigenous and Spanish traditions that were dramatically altered by European migrants and globalisation. One example is the ‘gauchos’ who continue to be a common icon of Argentine identity. They were ', 'mestizo', ' herdsmen that tended cattle in the Pampas regions during the 18th and 19th century. Gauchos wore distinctive clothing that consisted of a wide-brimmed hat, a poncho and loose trousers. For many, they represent the blending of European and indigenous ancestry, which helped create a new cultural identity.', 'For others, Argentine identity is rooted in the Catholic and Spanish heritage of the country. Indeed, one of the population’s defining features is that most people have European ancestry. This European heritage is often a source of pride and a key factor influencing the way many Argentines see themselves. Outside of Buenos Aires and other urban centres, however, the European influence is less pronounced.', 'Today, Argentines identify less with Europe than they did during the rule of Perón and the military. For the most part, families that have been in the country for more than one generation identify themselves as Argentine. In turn, there is little tension between different migrant groups as many feel they share the commonality of being Argentinian. Pride in Argentina is often accentuated when comparisons are made to other South American countries such as Chile or Brazil. Argentines often identify their population’s dominant European heritage as the feature that distinguishes them from the rest of South America.', 'Social Stratification', 'Throughout most of the 20th century, Argentina had a large middle-class, many of whom were descendants of immigrants who settled in cities and worked in the industrial, commercial and public sectors. However, in recent times, distribution of resources and finances has become less equitable. The gap is widening between those in the higher classes of society and those in the lower classes. This is visible in housing situations across the country; many upper-class families live in enclosed private neighbourhoods. Meanwhile, those who cannot afford proper housing tend to live in ‘', 'villa\xa0miseria', '’\xa0(shanty towns) found on the outskirts of cities.', 'Financial security and home ownership are important to many Argentines and have become common indicators of socioeconomic status. One’s level of education also tends to reflect differences in class. In large cities, the typical family saves for many years in order to purchase an apartment or house. Many seek to improve their socioeconomic status and provide a better future for their children. However, some Argentines are growing worried that this goal is becoming less viable as the country’s economic situation worsens. In turn, it is not uncommon to find young professionals migrating abroad in search of better employment opportunities.', 'Solidarity and Individualism', 'The turbulent political landscape has engendered a sense of solidarity among many middle-class families over the years. Indeed, many families and neighbours are willing to help one another during times of economic hardship through sharing food or exchanging gifts. One example is the concept of ‘', 'la\xa0gauchada', '’, which refers to a special favour. It reflects the attitude one has when asking someone close to them to help with something outside their typical duties (for example, helping someone find a job). Indeed, it is common for people to depend on their social network to assist in seeking opportunities. This is reflected in the term ‘', 'palanca', '’\xa0(‘leverage’), which refers to knowing the right people to help you reach a goal.', 'Argentines are generally friendly and hospitable to those they meet. Although many Argentines are focused on building strong communities, a strain of ', 'individualism', ' is also prevalent in the country. According to Hofstede Insights (2018), Argentina is classified as the most individualist Latin American country. Collective accomplishments or failures are not usually recognised as such but rather seen as the efforts of a few individuals who will be given most of the credit or blame. Moreover, some Argentines may place themselves or their family before the wider community or country.']"

Although independence was achieved in 1822, many elements of Portuguese culture have shaped Brazilian culture, such as naming practices, languages, artistic expressions and attitudes. Various other migratory patterns have also introduced many cultural influences that continue to shape Brazilian culture.', 'Contemporary Brazil is a vibrant blend of diverse landscapes, ethnicities, cultures and religions. Unity is expressed through shared language (Brazilian-Portuguese) and attitudes such as ', 'collectivism', ', ', 'saudade', ' (nostalgia and longing) and ', 'esperança', ' (hope).', 'Geography and Space', 'Given the size and geographic position of Brazil, the country contains a diversity of landscapes and climates that influence distinctions between groups of people. Brazil’s landscapes are as varied as the experiences of the people who occupy the spaces – with the tropical Amazon in the North, the almost arid ‘outback’ in the Northeast, the wetlands in the West and the cool climate of the South. The rainforest and jungle of the Amazon is home to some of Brazil’s few remaining pockets of isolated indigenous groups. Brazilians often associate their identity with their place of birth in the country, thus reflecting the importance of one’s sense of place.', 'Brazilians often categorise people based on their geographic location of origin and some may associate particular parts of Brazil with socioeconomic and ethnic groupings. For example, one distinction often drawn is the ‘two Brazils’, namely northern and southern Brazil. The former is considered to be home to many members of the African and indigenous population and is at times thought of as ‘underdeveloped’. This is contrasted with the southern, supposedly wealthier part of Brazil that is home to many people with European ancestry. Another distinction sometimes expressed is that between ', '‘litoral’ ', '(‘coast’), and ', '‘interior’', ' (‘inland’). To say someone is from the interior usually implies that they are from a rural area. However, this distinction is deceptive as there are large cities located far from the litoral/coast.', 'Differences are also evident within cities, whereby the city layout reflects ethnic, social and class distinctions. This generally manifests in the stark contrast between ', '‘favelas’ ', 'in the foreground, and high-rises in the background. Favelas (shanty towns located within or on the outskirts of Brazil’s largest cities) are home to roughly 6% of the country’s population. The makeshift housing typically forms when squatters situate themselves on vacant land at the edge of a city. Much of the plumbing and electrical wiring in favelas is improvised. Favelas are steadily increasing in size and number, and as a result of the crowded, unsanitary conditions, diseases spread quickly. These physical distinctions of space demonstrate the dispersed and tangible nature of inequality in Brazil. Moreover, favelas reflect the constant negotiation of space among various groups and peoples.', 'Ethnic Diversity', 'Brazil’s incredible ethnic diversity reflects its history of migratory patterns. The country has embraced a medley of migrants from all over the world. For example, people from European countries (such as its coloniser Portugal and other European missionaries), the African continent (for instance, the colonial import of indentured Angolan labourers), and Asia (Japanese economic migrants).', 'The migratory patterns have led to many Brazilians possessing mixed ancestry, expressed in the form of the ‘hidden hyphen’, such as ‘Afro-Brazilian’ or ‘Japanese-Brazilian’. Moreover, as different ethnicities have mixed, new generations of Brazilians with blended heritage have formed new ethnic identities. For example, ', '‘mulatto’', ' refers to Brazilians with a combination of European and African and/or ', 'Amerindian', ' heritage.', 'In the 1940s, the Brazilian social historian Gilberto Freyre declared Brazil to be a ""racial ', 'democracy', '"" whereby all citizens were considered equal in opportunity regardless of ', 'ethnicity', '. This discourse shapes much of how Brazilians understand their interactions with one another – as a unified culture with diversity at its core. A common perspective is that the mixed ethnic heritage of Brazilian society helps make the nation prosperous. Despite its ethnic diversity, a sense of commonality exists through the Brazilian-Portuguese language. The version of Portuguese spoken in Brazil reflects the country’s diverse people through the addition of numerous indigenous terms.', 'The combination of pride in ethnic diversity and the shared language of Brazilian-Portuguese reflects a sense of ‘unity in diversity’. Although there is a general appreciation for diversity, some ethnic minorities suffer discrimination based on prejudice against their ', 'ethnicity', '. Despite such, Brazilians have generally supported the reconceptualising of multi-ethnic heritage as a source of pride rather than shame.', 'Social Stratification and Interactions', 'Brazilian society tends to be stratified according to quite distinct socioeconomic groups often related to one’s ', 'ethnicity', '. The general pattern has seen those of darker skin to be more economically and socially disadvantaged. Meanwhile, those of lighter, usually of European heritage, tend to be part of the upper socioeconomic classes. Interactions between social classes are usually fleeting, occurring mainly through workplaces such as a businessperson interacting with a maid or driver.', 'One example of the interactions between social classes is between those who do not engage in manual labour and those who do. The notion of ‘working with one’s hands’ is commonly thought to reflect a low socioeconomic status whereas those from the middle class, sometimes defined as those with a ', '‘colarinho\xa0e\xa0gravata’ ', '(‘collar and tie’), generally do not engage in manual labour. Instead, middle-class Brazilian families commonly employ domestic servants to do the arduous tasks for the housewife (such as scrubbing the floor). Traditionally, social mobility is quite difficult in Brazil. While this has changed with the advancement of Brazil’s economy, many tend to stay within the same social class.', 'Collectivism and Agency', 'A collectivistic attitude and sense of solidarity are characteristic of many Brazilian people. There is often a sense of pride in their ability to work together to shape their lived experiences rather than passively accept the ', 'status quo', '. Among Brazilian civil society, there is a widely held belief that the government and law enforcement bodies are corrupt. Given the sceptical attitudes towards political institutions, ', 'collectivism', ' in Brazil does not extend towards the government. When in a time of need, Brazilian citizens generally reach out to and depend upon family, friends or those within their community. Brazilians commonly take to the streets and protest as a form of resistance.', 'Saudade\xa0and Esperança', 'Another central aspect of Brazilian culture is its ‘spirit’ that manifests through the expression of particular emotions. ', '‘Saudade’', ' is a term that refers to a combination of longing, nostalgia and melancholy. It reflects the desire for someone or something that is far away or unattainable, as well as reminiscing about a distant memory. Brazilians may feel saudade when they are living abroad and feel homesick or separated from a loved one. Saudade is not only an emotional response, but also a state of mind. Artistic expression in Brazil fosters and thrives on saudade as a source of inspiration for artists, musicians and poets.', 'Hope ', '(esperança)', ' is another driving sentiment integral to the Brazilian spirit. The notion of hope has deep associations with religion. For example, the commonly used phrase, ', '“se\xa0Deus\xa0quiser”', "" ('God Willing'), implies hope as well as a lack of control over the future. The Portuguese word for hope, "", '‘esperança’,', ' refers to a mixture of faith, expectation and destiny. Often exuding a sense of hope, Brazilians are typically light-hearted and joyful as they try to enjoy the present moment. Events such as ', 'Carnaval\xa0', 'and ', 'Festa Junina', ' reflect the Brazilian attitude of being able to celebrate in the face of adversity.', 'One of the most notable manifestations of saudade and esperança is the vibrant music culture. The energetic music culture of Brazil has globalised, becoming a distinctive hallmark of Brazilian culture for those unfamiliar with the country. The two most familiar music genres are the Bossa Nova and Samba. However, these two particular music genres are only a small part of the music culture in Brazil.

As a large majority of Canadians live within 100km of the Canada/USA border, there are similarities in behaviour and accent. Canadians share the informality, freedom of expression, pioneer spirit (particularly in the north of the country) and entrepreneurial imagination of the USA. Yet, Canadians tend to be noticeably more modest, indirect and considered in voicing their opinions. Canadian society has also harnessed cultural diversity as a source of unity in a distinct manner.', 'Canada emphasises egalitarianism and mutual respect. As the distribution of wealth often does not always reflect a principle of equality, the class divide within Canadian society is a somewhat hidden, awkward issue. Nevertheless, overt class distinctions within Canadian society are difficult to discern. Affluent people will sometimes identify themselves as being middle-class, reflecting a somewhat subdued attitude in regard to achievement, winning and success. Canadians tend to favour the underdog and avoid making people feel inferior because of a lower socioeconomic position. Conspicuous signs of wealth and luxury are rarely exhibited. Yet, this ‘', 'tall poppy syndrome', '’ is not as strong in Canada as it is in other ex-British colonies, such as Australia or New Zealand.', 'Anglophone and Francophone Canada', 'Canada was originally settled by both Britain and France, and English and French are both official languages. English and French speakers are referred to as the ', 'Anglophone', ' and ', 'Francophone', ' populations, respectively. Anglophones are the majority in all provinces and territories except Québec (in which French is the official language) and are seen as representing the mainstream culture of Canada. Francophones are often recognised as being a more cohesive linguistic group, as their language is more regionally specific and only spoken at home by roughly 20% of the population. A ', 'Francophone', ' is not necessarily a French-Canadian (a descendant of the original French colonialists); rather, the term encompasses any predominantly French speaker who affiliates with French-Canadian society more closely than mainstream Canadian society.', 'There are a few cultural differences between Anglophones and Francophones. These are less pronounced than if one were comparing a British and French person, but derive from those same cultural origins. While both are noticeably courteous and polite, Anglophones are slightly more reserved in most behavioural ', 'norms', ' and communication. They tend to maintain a calm and low-key presence. Francophones have retained a strong independent streak characteristic of French libertarianism. Nationalist French-Canadians have repeatedly campaigned for separation from the dominant ', 'Anglophone', ' society. There is ongoing discussion about Québec’s provincial independence and debate as to whether this nationalism remains rooted in ethnic and cultural difference or is best viewed as a linguistic or territorial argument.', 'Bi-Cultural Identity Acceptance', 'Ultimately, the differences between Anglo-Canada and French Canada have cultivated a shared national acceptance and understanding of bi-culturalism through which parallel identities are largely celebrated. People of diverse backgrounds are encouraged to maintain ties to their heritage instead of total assimilation into a defined Canadian ‘mould’. A dual identity has similar social and political weight as a uniquely Canadian one. In this way, Canadian society forms a mosaic of ethnic relations. Though Anglo-Canadian culture is dominant, Canadian citizenship does not necessarily stifle a dual identity and accommodates close ties to a home country. Canada has historically been welcoming and open towards immigration, seeing migrants as beneficial to the country’s development and growth. More than a fifth of Canada’s population is now comprised of people born outside the country.', 'Many people see ', 'multicultural', ' tolerance and cooperation as a typically Canadian tradition and virtue. Nevertheless, Canada’s ethnic relations are not without significant challenges. In particular, there are tensions exposed by its First Nations people seeking to reclaim their culture and assert their ethnic sovereignty over the land. Their success has been somewhat constrained by the current attitude of co-operational ethnic relations in Canada: an ethos of ethnic equality legitimises migrant identities, yet it diminishes Indigenous peoples’ claim\xa0to special ethnic status. The status of Indigenous communities as coherent ethnic, cultural and political groups is relegated to be one among many by the prevailing egalitarian ethos.', 'Many Canadians regard the historical treatment and recognition of its First Nations people as a significant stain on Canada’s history (Indigenous Canadians have had their ethnic and cultural identities denied in policy and often erased from community consciousness). However, while a consensus exists regarding the existence of historical atrocities and injustice, reconciliation and a solution to indigenous claims for enhanced status is likely to be complex, contentious and prolonged. The Indigenous population’s disadvantage in comparison to people of other backgrounds remains a chronic social problem.', 'Largely, however, most Canadians share the same benefits of the large middle class. The population is generally globally oriented and well-informed. Canada has been ranked as one of the most educated country in the world, and over half of its residents have received a tertiary education. There is a strong value placed on reason and logic to guide decisions and ethics.']"

This migration has stressed the living conditions for many Chilean families already living in poverty, resulting in the emergence of a new social class – the middle-low class.', 'The interaction between social classes is usually fleeting, occurring mainly through workplaces such as a businessperson interacting with a maid or taxi driver. Various facets of society perpetuate social class distinctions. One example is marriage, whereby family pressures can prevent one from socialising or marrying those from a different social class. Another notable example is in education, whereby the quality of teaching is largely dependent on whether the institution is public or private. Those in the upper classes often send their children to private schools, which are often too expensive and inaccessible to the lower classes.', ""One's social class can often be discerned by one’s surname.

Interactions and socialisation on the street became less common and people became less open to conversing in public. Friends would meet in the home and the private sphere instead, while many others would fear such visits due to curfews. Moreover, television programs would frequently be interrupted by nationwide messages from Pinochet, which contained orders or general information for civilians, thus often reminding Chileans of the change in social conditions. Chile became a more individualistic society and social class distinctions were exacerbated. Moreover, inequality between socioeconomic classes grew, in part due to widespread unemployment, which consequently reduced the standard of living for those of the lower and middle classes.', 'In contemporary times, conversations about the military ', 'junta', "" or investigations into human rights abuses are likely to reveal the polarised attitudes within Chilean society.

Today, social stratifications remain obvious. There is a steeply unequal distribution of wealth throughout the country. While the middle and working classes are growing and gaining more social advantage, a small minority continue to hold most of Colombia’s wealth and power. These are generally the traditionally rich elite families and ‘narco’ families (those families originally from a lower class background that have recently gained great wealth and privilege from the drug trade’s stimulation of the economy). Most Colombians belong to a lower class that lacks steady employment. Family ties and elite networks ', '(roscas)', ' often have a lot of influence behind the scenes in high-level business and political dealings in Colombia. These kinds of connections are often the most valuable asset one can have for opening up opportunities; in some cases, networks can secure a job more effectively than educational achievement.', 'Interaction between people from different classes may be limited. Some people might mix company only in the workplace (for example, between business people and those in service jobs). This social isolation has meant that Colombians have tended to form strong group loyalties to their class. One’s class background has become a major aspect informing people’s sense of identity.

However, many Colombians make the argument that their society is classist, not racist, because almost everyone shares mixed ancestry anyway.

However, this generally relates to the culture and people rather than the nation-state or its institutions. The population has become very sceptical of the government, systems and authority figures due to pervasive corruption at all levels of society. Therefore, national pride is generally directed towards Mexico in the cultural sense. Many Mexicans feel their country has great cultural depth and wealth in comparison to others. There is a saying, “Como México no hay dos” (There is none other like Mexico), which reflects how people believe Mexico has a particular uniqueness.', ""Much foreign knowledge of the cultural traditions in Mexico gravitates around ideas drawn from popular culture (e.g. tequila, tacos, tortillas, mariachis). The real Mexican love for these famous aspects of their culture should not be underestimated. Furthermore, one finds that almost all Mexicans have an incredible knowledge of their country’s history. People are very proud of the Mesoamerican legacies (such as the Aztecs and Mayans) and are often very educated on the events in history that shaped the identity of their society. It is common for the average person to be able to list many ancient stories and cultural achievements.\xa0Mexicans take particular delight when their culture receives global recognition or foreign appreciation. For example, traditional Mexican cuisine is recognised as a global cultural treasure, listed by UNESCO as 'Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity'."", '10', 'Mexicans have generally been very careful to preserve their cultural character amidst rapid globalisation. The country’s close proximity to the US has seen people adopt many Western cultural influences. However, most foreign customs are generally assumed with an extra Mexican flair added on. For example, if one orders pizza at an Italian restaurant, they are still likely to receive chillies on the side. A person may be regarded as a ‘', 'malinchista', '’ if they have a tendency to revere or prefer foreign things. The term has negative connotations of disloyalty or treachery, as its origins trace back to an Indigenous woman submitting to Spanish conquerors.', 'Safety, Fatalism and Prediction of Events', 'The global media’s portrayal of Mexico often concentrates on the country’s struggle against corruption and the violence of drug cartels. It is true that safety and security is a common concern for most people. Hard social conditions and government policies have influenced a rise in violence and crime ', '(la delincuencia)', ' in the present era, both anarchic and organised. Therefore, many people have to restrict their movements to avoid crimes of opportunity. It is common for friends and family members to stay in close contact with one another. For example, independent adults may have a continuous group chat with their family members or a location notification system on their phone so that each person generally knows one’s activities, whereabouts and when they have arrived home safely.', 'Due to past experiences where Mexicans’ safety has been directly threatened, some people may interpret the physical onset of anxiety as an omen. For instance,  panic or anxiety that triggers a somatic feeling (such as tightening in the chest) may be perceived as a signal for danger. If a Mexican is in a safe situation when feeling the sensation, they may then interpret it to mean an earthquake is coming or a member of their family might be in trouble.', 'There is a common belief throughout Mexico that God predetermines events and one’s destiny is in his hands. This ', 'fatalism', ' has been influenced by the practice of Catholicism throughout the country. Many devout Mexicans see the ', 'Virgin of Guadalupe', ' as the appropriate messenger and means to reach God. It is common for people to try and change their circumstances by revering her and asking for her to grant their prayers. Indeed, the amount of ', 'fatalism', ' regarding one’s personal control over events often varies depending on how religious one is. See ', 'Religion', ' ', 'and', ' ', 'Catholicism in Mexico', ' for more information.', 'Interpretations of Death', 'Mexico had more homicides in 2017 than any previous year on record.', '11', ' Due to such crime and poor public health, death is quite pervasive in society. However, Mexicans have a unique relationship with death. They are generally very fearful of it but do not hide it or keep it as a taboo subject. Instead, they keep quite a good-humoured familiarity with it. For example, there is a longstanding tradition of celebrating the ‘Day of the Dead’ ', '(Día de los Muertos)', ' on the 2nd of November. During this period, it is thought that the deceased can visit family and friends. The celebration of this concept somewhat reflects the contemporary integration of past Mesoamerican traditions (the Aztecs historically venerated the goddess of death – ', 'Mictecacihuatl)', '.', 'Foreigners may observe Mexicans’ close cultural proximity to death and interpret it to mean that they are not scared of dying. On the contrary, Mexicans are often extremely fearful of death; this embracement of it is a way of coping with their mortality. Underneath the jokes, Mexicans generally have a very strong respect for the deceased and can feel very uncomfortable “playing with death” for fear of reprisal. See ', 'Folk Religions and Magic', '\xa0in ', 'Religion', ' for more information on Mexican superstition.', 'Organisation and Time', 'Flexibility and adaptability are key features of Mexican culture and society. Daily life is less rigidly structured, and there is a more relaxed approach to established rules. This cultural disposition can encourage spontaneity and a light disregard for law and order in daily life (i.e. getting out of a car stopped at a traffic light). As a result, Mexicans frequently navigate unpredictable situations that demand flexibility and improvisation. For example, is not uncommon for public officials or authority figures to ‘take a bite’ by asking for a ', 'mordida', ' (bribe, literally translating to ‘bite’)', ' ', 'to bureaucratic expedite matters.', '12', 'Inherent flaws and limitations within formal structures mean Mexicans often have to employ informal strategies to navigate rules and regulations. These include the use of ', 'palancas', ' (personal connections who can influence preferential treatment), ', 'coyotes', ' (persons who are paid to do others’ administrative transactions), and ', 'regalos', ' (gifts).', '13', ' This environment has fostered a culture of resourcefulness and ingenuity, evident in how Mexicans have adapted the informal economy to create job opportunities for themselves. While certain practices might appear unorthodox to external observers, such actions are seen as a pragmatic necessity in navigating unreliable bureaucratic procedures.', 'The cultural tolerance for imprecision and flexibility can also be partly attributed to the ', 'mañana', ' attitude and fluid approach to timekeeping in Mexico. Literally meaning ‘tomorrow’, the term ', '‘mañana’', ' can also signify an unspecified time in the future. This loose timestamp is often used during delays as reassurance that a task will get done eventually and offers justification for procrastination. The ‘', 'mañana', ' attitude’ downplays the need to rush or worry, reflecting the slow pace and relaxed approach to timekeeping in Mexican culture. This laid-back perspective is more prevalent among older generations and in rural or coastal areas.', 'Socialisation', 'Mexico scores 97 out of 100 on Hofstede’s cultural dimension of ', 'indulgence', ', indicating that it has a highly indulgent culture. As such, people generally exhibit a willingness to realise their impulses and desires with regard to enjoying life and having fun. In indulgent cultures, there is a general tendency towards optimism, and people may place a higher degree of importance on leisure time. One commonly hears this trait of Mexican culture described in the saying, “Mexicans don’t live to work; they work to live”. Indeed, Mexicans generally devote much time to social occasions, sometimes prioritising individual relationships over other commitments.', 'Mexicans love socialising, and cantinas, bars, town squares and other public spaces often provide great atmospheres to do so. There is a lot of social spontaneity and improvisation in Mexico. Invitations to occasions are often open invites, and engagements progress naturally as people sense the mood to make decisions about further movements. Many Mexicans feel there is social rigidity in the English-speaking West as many plans have a lot of detail as to who can come, what one should bring and when it starts. Some Mexican migrants may feel that social engagements are designed too meticulously.', '', '_____________________', '1 Central Intelligence Agency, 2024', '\n', '2 Central Intelligence Agency, 2024', '\n', '3 Regional Office for Latin America and the Caribbean, 2014', '\n', '4 Vazquez Maggio, 2017', '\n', '5 Hofstede Insights, 2024', '\n', '6\xa0National Commission for the Development of Indigenous Peoples, 2015', '\n', '7 National Commission for the Development of Indigenous Peoples, 2015', '\n', '8 International Fund for Agricultural Development, 2017', '\n', '9 Minority Rights Group, 2018', '\n', '10 UNESCO, 2010', '\n', '11 Meixler, 2018', '\n', '12\xa0Coronado, 2008', '\n', '13\xa0Baez-Camargo, 2019']"
mexican,"['Diversity', 'Hospitality', 'Modesty', 'Solidarity', 'Collectivism', 'Perseverance', 'Peru is located in the western part of the South American continent. The country was the birthplace of the ancient Inca Empire and remains famously known for the archaeological wonders of this civilisation, such as Machu Picchu. At the height of the empire, its borders extended from the current Colombia-Ecuador border to central Chile. Spanish ', 'colonisation', ' deeply influenced Peruvian culture through introducing institutions such as the Catholic religion and Spanish language. In certain parts of Peru, such as Cuzco, one can see how these two cultural histories merged; for instance, there are Inca walls topped by Spanish colonial structures.', 'Although Inca culture is a source of pride for many Peruvians, modern-day Peruvian culture is rich in diversity. Indeed, Peru is immensely diverse in terms of geography and landscapes, which has contributed to the variety of its people concerning language, ', 'ethnicity', ', lifestyles, values and attitudes. Nonetheless, there are also some common traits in Peruvian culture, such as pride in their hospitable nature and strong community bonds.', 'Ethnic Composition and Language', 'Contemporary Peru’s ethnic diversity is rooted in its history. The country was already incredibly ethnically diverse with various indigenous ethnic groups before ', 'colonisation', '. However, the ', 'colonisation', ' period saw further diversity through the introduction of a sizeable Spanish population, an African demographic under slavery, Chinese migrants as indentured labourers as well as many other Europeans over history. Thus, ethnic categories are plentiful, ranging from various indigenous ethnic groups to new ethnic groups based on inter-ethnic marriages.', 'Today, Peruvians tend to identify with numerous ethnic categories that reflect how these indigenous and migrant groups have integrated over time. These include but are not limited to ', 'Amerindian', ' and Amazonian indigenous ethnic groups, Afro-Peruvians (such as ', 'mulattos)', ', mixed ethnic groups such as ', 'zambos', ' (African-', 'Amerindian', ') and ', 'mestizos\xa0', '(European-', 'Amerindian', '), those of predominantly European heritage ', '(blanco)', ', and more recent migrant groups such as Chinese or Japanese. Generally, skin colour and place of birth are common determinants of how people perceive ', 'ethnicity', '.', 'The official languages of Peru are Spanish (the dominant language of the country) and the indigenous languages of Quechua and Aymara. There are also various unofficial languages (such as Ashaninka and other native languages) spoken throughout the country. Many Peruvians, particularly those in Cusco, Puno, Ayacucho and other cities and rural areas of the highlands, are bilingual, speaking both Spanish and an indigenous language. Indeed, it is commonplace to hear Quechua or Aymara languages used in daily conversations throughout major cities. The dialect of Spanish spoken in Peru is quite distinct from its Latin American counterparts, as it incorporates many native Quechua and Aymara terms.', 'Indigeneity and Identity', 'Indigeneity and the diversity of indigenous groups is an important part of Peru’s ethnic composition. According to Minority Rights Group International, there are 51 indigenous groups in Peru.1 The common Peruvian proverb states that ', '‘El que no tiene de Inga tiene de Mandinga’', ', which generally means that every Peruvian has either some indigenous or African ancestry.

For instance, those with Andean or ', 'mestizo', ' features are sometimes derogatorily referred to as ', ""‘cholo'"", '. The concept of ', 'cholo', ' broadly describes somebody of indigenous origins residing in urban areas. This word can have positive or negative connotations (as the term can also sometimes be used as a unifying identity marker). However, the general trend is for the word to be used in a pejorative sense. Similarly, those from the Costa region may be subjected to ethnic stereotypes when travelling through the Andes (for example, some may be referred to as a ', '‘gringo’ ', 'or', ' ‘foreigner’', '.', 'While some Peruvians are deeply proud of their indigenous heritage and traditions, others may feel a sense of shame or may attempt to distance themselves from their indigeneity. For example, some of the younger generation from the Andes may prefer to learn Spanish rather than their local indigenous language. There have been efforts to disassociate ', 'ethnicity', ' from social stereotypes; for instance, the census conducted in 2017 asked respondents to self-identify by ', 'ethnicity', ' rather than select pre-determined categories.3', 'Geography and Space', 'As one of the largest countries on the South American continent, Peru contains a diverse set of climates and landscapes. There are quite noticeable ethnic divides between the urban and rural areas of Peru, with the general pattern being that indigenous peoples reside in rural areas and those living in urban spaces are of European ancestry. The country is divided into three distinct regions: the high mountains (', 'Sierra', ') of the Andes in the centre, the dry and narrow coastal plains ', '(Costa)', ' in the west, and the tropical lowlands ', '(Selva)', ' of the Amazon Basin to the east.', 'The geographic distinctions between these regions are one of the major factors contributing to the country’s cultural and social diversity. Those who reside in the mountainous Andes are often referred to as ', ""‘Andinos'"", ',\xa0while those in the forested Amazonia are referred to as\xa0', ""‘Charapas'"", '.\xa0Meanwhile, Peruvians who live in the coastal plains may be referred to as\xa0', ""'Costeños'."", ' Indigenous Peruvians (known collectively as Amerindians) tend to populate rural areas, particularly in the Andes. Moreover, the 50+ different indigenous tribal groups in the Amazonian region maintain cultural lifestyles that are distinct from most other Amerindians, owing to how isolated the Amazon is from the rest of the Peruvian population.', ""In contrast, the Costa region is the most developed and densely populated part of the country, home to most of the country's urban spaces. Indeed, approximately 78.3% of the population resides in urban areas that are predominantly in the Costa region.4 The large proportion of people living in urban spaces is in part due to the lack of suitable land for farming. Civil war has also prompted the internal migration of many Amerindians to urban areas over the last few decades (see section on "", 'Politico-Economic Changes and Internal Conflict', '\xa0below). This has dramatically changed the urban spaces of Peru and also led to the creation of ', 'pueblos jóvenes', ' or ', 'barriadas', ' (shanty towns) around city perimeters.', 'Regionalism', ""The diversity of landscapes that partition the habitable regions of Peru have long posed a challenge in forging a national identity. Instead, Peru's geography has profoundly contributed to the forming and maintenance of social and political identities based on one’s region of birth. Nearly all Peruvians associate with a local identity, such as a "", 'limeño', ' from Lima, a ', 'cuzqueño', ' from Cusco, a ', 'chalaco', ' from Callao and so forth.', 'A deep association with one’s birthplace is noticeable throughout the country. For example, there are thousands of regional and local clubs in cities run by migrants from rural parts of the country that allow people to maintain a connection with their regional culture. Regardless of where a Peruvian is located, one remains connected to their place of birth, particularly in major cities like Lima where many become self-aware of ethnic traits.', 'Social Stratification and Interactions', 'Peruvian society tends to be stratified between quite distinct socioeconomic groups that are often related to one’s ', 'ethnicity', '. The class ', 'hierarchy', ' largely reflects Peru’s colonial past, with those of lighter skin (typically of European heritage) usually belonging to the upper socioeconomic classes. Meanwhile, those with darker skin or indigenous heritage are generally more economically and socially disadvantaged.', 'While the demographics of social classes in contemporary Peru are not ethnically homogeneous, there is less social mobility for people of certain ethnicities. For example, people of ', 'Amerindian', "" descent who have migrated to urban centres often face difficulties in securing stable employment. Nevertheless, improvements in Peru's economy have seen greater fluidity and mobility, which has enabled people from groups that have traditionally experienced discrimination to move into the higher socioeconomic class or occupy influential positions. However, interactions between social classes are usually fleeting, occurring mainly through workplaces or public places such as a businessperson interacting with a driver."", 'Diversity of Lifestyles', 'Differences in lifestyles and daily routines are quite pronounced depending on one’s place of birth, ', 'ethnicity', ' and socioeconomic class. Those of European descent dominate the government and industry sectors, while mestizos generally form the middle class of Peruvian society. Many from the latter group hold managerial and professional jobs with some as small landowners and labourers. The urban middle to upper classes have more affluent lifestyles. Many reserve the afternoon as a time for the ', 'siesta', ' (nap), followed by a return to work or to participate in social activities. Lower-socioeconomic domestic helpers perform many daily tasks in the home, such as cooking and house cleaning.', 'Meanwhile, the recent internal migration of mestizos and indigenous persons to cities has created new lifestyles more reliant on technology and transportation. Some live in makeshift housing and live more precariously. There are many employed in the informal sector of the economy, outside government regulation and the protection provided by legal employment. Some jobs in the informal sector include street vendors, car windscreen cleaners and workshop owners in shanty towns.', 'Those in rural areas, usually of ', 'Amerindian', ' heritage, often live according to agricultural cycles. For example, planting and harvesting periods are quite demanding and involve communal-based work, whereas other times of the year are much more relaxed. People rise and go to sleep early to complete work during daylight hours. Those who work as pastoralists follow a more distinct and isolated annual cycle by herding sheep, llamas and alpacas in elevations above the limits of agriculture.', 'Politico-Economic Changes and Internal Conflict', 'Over the last few decades, Peruvians have experienced various changes and challenges to their political and economic situation. One major political event was an internal conflict that erupted between the government and various citizen-organised guerilla and military groups.', 'The most well-known actor in the internal conflict has been the left-wing socialist organisation known as the ', 'Sendero Luminoso', ' (Shining Path). In the 1980s, Sendero Luminoso began a campaign of guerrilla warfare aimed at overthrowing the government. The group sought to restructure society and resurrect aspects of Inca social order and systems. Along with other organisations, Sendero Luminoso engaged in an armed struggle against the Peruvian state. The internal conflict resulted in approximately 70,000 casualties between 1980-2000.5 The conflict began in the mountainous regions of Peru, leading to the displacement of many indigenous persons from the Andean highlands. Violence eventually reached urban areas, resulting in Lima being placed under curfew amid fragile social relations among citizens and the government.', 'During the internal conflict, the government changed hands numerous times, with each leader implementing new laws or restricting civil rights. In 1990, Alberto Fujimori, a son of Japanese immigrants, was elected as president. With promises of government reform, economic growth and an end to the internal conflict, Fujimori suspended the constitution, dissolved congress and restricted civil liberties. Fujimori is commonly known for ending the ongoing conflict with Sendero Luminoso as well as imposing a series of severe economic policies in an attempt to boost the economy. These measures, known as the ‘Fujishock’, led to many financial struggles for Peruvians.', 'These political and economic events still impact present-day Peruvian politics. For some Peruvians, particularly those from the Andes, the political upheavals during the guerrilla warfare continue to be a highly sensitive topic. Fujimori is quite a controversial person in Peru. While some consider his economic decisions problematic, others believe these decisions helped alleviate many economic problems of the country. For this reason, many Peruvians, especially those who experienced the serious economic crises in the 1980s and 1990s, continue to support him.', 'Uncertainty Avoidance', 'Although Peru has now returned to a much more ', 'democratic', ', politically and economically stable country, this turbulent political history has deeply affected the outlook of many Peruvians. One major consequence is the cultural tendency to avoid uncertainty and ambiguity as reflected in the culture’s high ', 'Uncertainty Avoidance', ' score of 87.6 The country’s geographical position also contributes to this score, as nearly all of Peru periodically endures extensive infrastructure and agricultural damage from earthquakes, landslides, El Niño rains and other natural disasters.', 'Indeed, many Peruvians approach life with a mentality of planning for only one day at a time. When making decisions, they tend to draw on lessons from the past and focus on the present context. Peruvians also tend to communicate indirectly and avoid conflict in their day-to-day lives. At the same time, Peruvians have learnt the importance of dissent and political activism. Many are willing to voice their concerns through participation in protests and public demonstrations. For the most part, these forms of resistance have remained peaceful.', 'Solidarity and Hospitality', 'Peruvians tend to be highly collectivistic and share a sense of solidarity. People are often interdependent and will often prioritise the needs of their group over personal desires. This sense of solidarity shines through during times of adversity. For example, the frequent occurrence of natural disasters in Peru has seen many Peruvians set aside social, cultural and economic differences to assist one another. On a more local level, communities and families will often play a vital role in supporting their weakest members, particularly in rural areas and the impoverished urban boroughs. Football (soccer) is also a major unifying force in the country.', 'Peruvians are also usually very warm, welcoming and hospitable. Many enjoy celebrating and indulging when the opportunity arises, such as during weekends and holiday periods. Indeed, it is common for Peruvians to invite guests to their home and show their hospitable nature by offering food and drink. For some Peruvians, there is a general expectation that people will reciprocate acts of kindness, favours and hospitality.', '', '_____________________', '1\xa0Minority Rights Group International, 20182\xa0Central Intelligence Agency, 20203\xa0Minority Rights Group International, 20184\xa0Central Intelligence Agency, 20205\xa0Centre for Justice and Accountability, 20166\xa0Hofstede Insights, 2018']"

Today, most foreigners are likely to have a rough familiarity with what ‘American life’ looks like. However, the idea of a homogenous American culture is no longer reflective of the plurality of values and populations within it.', 'American society is highly culturally diverse, with the social, ethnic and religious make-up of the population having been shaped by a history of immigration. One commonly finds social attitudes, lifestyles and beliefs can differ significantly between regional, ethnic, socio-economic or partisan backgrounds. Considering this large demographic diversity, the following descriptions are unlikely to be representative of every American person’s experience or views. However, there are common themes and principles that contribute to the values, attitudes, beliefs and ', 'norms', ' of the dominant society.', 'Colonial History', 'The land of present-day America was originally home to expansive numbers of Indigenous peoples and nations, including the Cayuga, Cherokee, Huron, Mohawk, Oneida, Onondaga, Seneca, and Tuscarora.1 European ', 'colonisation', ' began in 1607, with settlers establishing multiple separate colonies across land. In 1776, these colonies united to fight for independence from the United Kingdom, eventually forming what is now known as the ‘', 'United States of America', '’.', 'The European migrants that arrived over the ', 'colonisation', ' period were from a variety of religious and social groups, who were mostly fleeing religious persecution or seeking a better life. For example, many English Protestants non-conformists (such as Quakers and Puritans) migrated to escape religious persecution in Europe and preserve their beliefs in new communities.2 Additional migrants were also sent to the United States against their will, including convicts, indentured servants and enslaved Africans. Such migration dramatically changed the ethnic and social make-up of the United States and ultimately established a European-like cultural mainstream. The variation of social and religious communities established over the ', 'colonisation', ' period continue to inform the diversity of American society today.', 'National Identity and Values', 'While many other nations base their national identity on shared ethnic or ancestral origins, the American identity and patriotism is largely rooted in shared moral and political values.3,4,5,6 This has been shaped by its history of European ', 'colonisation', '. Many of the early colonists were considered radical for their time, holding beliefs about social mobility in the class system and limited government that were not common in Europe at the time.7 They were often highly individualistic and determined to preserve strongly held social, religious, political or economic ideals (such as liberty, equality before the law, individual responsibility, ', 'democratic', ' and laissez-faire economics).8 In turn, the American national identity became largely defined by a set of foundational ideas and values about what a liberal society should look like. For example, the Declaration of Independence directly articulates a belief in the limited involvement and control of the government on citizen’s personal lives.', 'These ideologies persist in the moral and civic culture of American society today. Such values of personal freedom and liberty especially have become intrinsic to the country’s cultural identity and character.9 For example, 77% of Americans view “having freedom of choice in how to live one’s life” as the most valuable aspect of American life.10 This is epitomised in the common expressions describing the United States as a “free country”, the “land of opportunity” or “cradle of liberty”.11 The American Constitution is generally regarded to embody the fundamental American notion of independence – particularly in regards to the First and Second Amendments (which guarantee freedom of religion, freedom of speech and the right to keep and bear arms).12,13 Indeed, a 2017 study found 84% agreed that individual liberties as protected by the Constitution personify the national character.14 Ultimately, such notions of ‘freedom’ and ‘independence’ tend to occupy a more prominent place in public and private discourse in the United States than elsewhere.15', 'The idea of cultural assimilation has been particularly powerful throughout the country’s history, whereby migrants can become ‘American’ by accepting and embracing American values. There remains a general expectation that new migrants and citizens will respect cultural values and develop similar patriotism. However, the notion of cultural assimilation is changing as more emphasis is being put on the importance of a bi-cultural identity in appreciation of the country’s broad ethnic, religious and cultural diversity.', 'American Exceptionalism', 'The United States’ national identity has also been informed by a notion of exceptionalism that became prominent in public discourse both within the country and overseas. This refers to the idea that the United States is in some way different from other countries, possessing unique characteristics that are worthy of universal admiration.16,17 There is a common assumption that the United States’ values, political system and history grant it the capacity and responsibility to make the world a better place.18 Such a view of the United States’ global role has been further influenced by its involvement in foreign affairs and trade, in which it has played a powerful and influential role.19 Indeed, many of its citizens have considered the nation to be an example and guardian of ', 'democracy', ' and freedom.20', 'Moreover, the globalisation of American cultural values has led many to view it as the archetype of what a liberal capitalist, developed country is. American ideas of freedom now reverberate throughout the world, promoted by an internationalised mass media, consumer culture, and economic marketplace.21 As such, while Americans may criticise their government, the notion of the United States’ cultural superiority remains very strong. Opinion polls show most believe the United States is one of the greatest countries in the world, if not the best.22', 'Patriotism', 'National pride is expressed quite openly in American culture. For example, it is common for people to publicly describe themselves as ‘patriotic’. While there are differing views on what being ‘patriotic’ means, it is typically associated with showing respect, loyalty and love for one’s country.23 Traditional symbols and displays of patriotism include showing support for military troops and servicemen, standing for the national anthem and reciting the Pledge of Allegiance to the American flag. One’s perceived patriotism may also be defined by the degree to which they show dedication to American political institutions and national values, such as freedom, liberty and ', 'democracy', ' (see ', 'National Identity and Values', ').24,25', 'The United States’ national identity and patriotism has traditionally been thought to unify the population in spite of its diversity (whether differences are ethnic, religious, class-based, or ideological), just as it united early colonisers from different lands.

However, many also have ', 'multicultural', ' backgrounds. Some of the largest ancestries are German, Irish, English, Italian, French, Polish and Scottish. Some white Americans may self-identify their ancestry as simply ‘American’ due to the length of time their family has inhabited the United States (those who do so are usually of English/European descent). Overall, the states with the highest concentration of ‘non-Hispanic whites’ are found in the Midwest, New England, the Rocky Mountains, Kentucky, West Virginia and East Tennessee.', 'As the majority, much social discourse within the United States tends to use the socioeconomic status of the white demographic as the standard measurement from which other ethnic and racial groups’ social and economic well-being is compared. Indeed, white Americans have generally held the highest political and economic positions in the country. The white working class had also decreased over the past 30 years, as more have gained higher education.34', 'However, today multiple studies show a notable social and political divide between the white working class (broadly defined as those without college degree and with an annual income lower than the national median) and the lower and upper middle classes (those with college educations and higher income status). The working class are more likely to have experienced shortfalls in their income and wealth, while the upper class is more likely to have experienced stronger gains in the past 10 years.35 This divide has been correlated with political positions and divisions, with the former more likely to vote Republican and the latter is more likely to vote Democrat.36 Ultimately, it is important to note that ‘white American’ encompasses almost a quarter of a billion people, spread across all classes of society with diverging experiences.', 'Hispanic', '‘Hispanic or Latino’ describes any person of Cuban, Mexican, Puerto Rican, South or Central American, or other Spanish descent.37 This is an ethnic signifier, not a racial category.

Most Hispanics Americans have Mexican (61.5%), Puerto Rican (9.6%), Cuban (3.9%), Salvadoran (3.8%) or Dominican (3.5%) ancestry.40 According to the US Census Bureau 2019, 65% of Hispanics identified their ', 'race', ' as white and a further 25.6% identified with some other ', 'race', ' not recognised in the census.41 This likely reflects the fact that a significant portion self-identify as ', 'mestizo', ' (a person of mixed ', 'race', ' that has European and native ', 'Amerindian', ' heritage to some degree) or ', 'mulatto', ' (a person of mixed ', 'race', ' that has European and African ancestry to some degree).', 'Migration from ', 'Latin America', ' has been one of the largest drivers increasing the Hispanic population in the United States, with thousands of immigrants arriving in the United State every year. However, two thirds (67%) of all Hispanic and Latino Americans were born in the United States.42 The Spanish-speaking population also has a long history in America that pre-dates British ', 'colonisation', '. For example, the states in the Southwest, West Coast and Florida were originally colonised by Spain. Meanwhile, present-day California, New Mexico, Nevada, Arizona and Texas were originally part of Mexico until 1848. This Spanish-speaking history continues to be visible in the names of major cities, such as Los Angeles, San Antonio and San Diego. Many of these states continue to have the largest Hispanic populations in the country. It is estimated over 40 million Americans speak Spanish at home in total.43 The states and territories with the largest Hispanic populations are California, Texas, Florida, Puerto Rico and New York.', 'Black', 'According to the national census, 14.2% of Americans identify as black or African-American.44 The term ‘', 'black', '’ refers to the ', 'race', ', while ‘', 'African-American', '’ specifically refers to an ancestral subgroup within that ', 'race', ' (usually those descending from slaves of the 19th century). Some people may not feel a strong affiliation with their African ', 'genealogy', ', but identify as ‘African-American’ for its cultural meaning in contemporary America. More recently, others have preferred for their ', 'race', ' to be referred to as simply ‘black’, finding terms readdressing their identity by another category to be insulting.', 'The United States’ black population was initially formed as a result of the transatlantic slave trade (from the 16th to 19th century), during which hundreds of thousands of African captives were sent to the United States and forced into slavery.45 By 1860, the number of enslaved Africans in the United States reached nearly four million, with more than half living in the cotton-producing states of the South.46 Many were forced to work as servants or labourers in industries such as cotton or tobacco production, and were subjected to inhumane treatments and abuse.47 Although slavery was outlawed in 1865, in the South enforced racial segregation legislation from 1877 to 1954 (known as ‘Jim Crow’) that systematically marginalised blacks as inferior to whites, affecting almost every aspect of daily life.48 This history of domination, subjugation and exploitation continues to impact the experience of black Americans today and remains a sensitive topic (see ', 'Racial and Ethnic Relations', ' below).', 'The United States still struggles to build and maintain positive ', 'race', ' relations between white majority and black minority amidst racial inequalities (see ', 'Racial and Ethnic Relations', ' below). The black population is still significantly disadvantaged in regards to rates of imprisonment, education, income and political representation. As such, one’s experience as a black person in the United States differs significantly from those of the white population. Further, black Americans are more likely to say their ', 'race', ' is central to their identity than those of other racial backgrounds. A 2019 survey of black adults found about three-quarters of respondents stated being black was extremely (52%) or very (22%) important to how they think of themselves.49', 'Today, most of the black population is born in the United States, descending from former slaves. However, the foreign-born black population has also increased in recent years, with significant voluntary migration from Africa, parts of South America and Caribbean Islands (such as Jamaica, Haiti, Dominican Republic and Trinidad and Tobago). Each of these groups has distinct cultural and social identities. Over half of the country’s black population (56%) lives in the South.50', 'Asian', 'It is estimated 6.8% of the American population are Asian (23 million people), making this the fastest growing racial group in the country.51,52 The term ‘Asian American’ refers to a vast and diverse group of people who trace their roots to over twenty countries across East and Southeast Asia, as well as the Indian subcontinent.53 The largest ancestry groups among Asian Americans are Chinese (23%), Indian (20%), Filipino (18%), Vietnamese (9%), Korean (8%) and Japanese (6%).54 However, it is estimated 14% of Asian Americans identify with one or more races and 3% identify as Hispanic.55 As such, it is important to note that the Asian population of the United States encompasses many different cultural backgrounds, histories, languages and other characteristics.', 'It is estimated 57% of the Asian population was born in another country.56 However, many of these people migrated over 10 years ago and have since had families in the United States. For example, most people with Japanese heritage are American-born. Overall, the Asian population in the United States is considered to have high economic status and educational attainment when compared with the overall population.', 'However, this does not reflect significant variations between different origin groups. For example, while 75% of Indians 25 years or older hold a bachelor’s degree or higher, this figure is only 15% among Bhutanese. There are also vast differences between how recently individuals migrated, their pre-arrival life experiences and migration circumstances. For example, the experience of those who arrived as refugees in the 1970s (e.g. many Cambodians, Laotians, Hmong) are likely to vary significantly from those who arrive as skilled migrants today. As of 2019, nearly a third of America’s Asian population live in California.', 'Indigenous', 'Before ', 'colonisation', ', the land of present-day America was home to expansive numbers of Indigenous peoples and nations (including the Cayuga, Cherokee, Huron, Mohawk, Oneida, Onondaga, Seneca, and Tuscarora).57 European colonisers violently conquered and dispossessed the existing Indigenous populations. Indigenous people were forcibly assimilated or displaced from their traditional lands, fracturing and marginalising their communities and societies. The Indian reservation system was created to exclude Indigenous communities from areas of land that European Americans wished to settle. Many of these reservations remain today.', ""Today, 'Native Americans and Alaska Natives' comprise 1.7% of the American population according to the National Census.58 There is much effort within Indigenous communities to preserve their culture, traditions and spirituality. Despite these positive developments however, Native Americans are still one of the United States’ most economically disadvantaged populations.59 Many continue to face challenges in access to health care and education.60"", 'Importantly, the degree to which a Native American knows or integrates their traditional culture into their life varies and is said not to define them as being any ‘more’ or ‘less’ Indigenous. For example, some Native Americans live with their tribal community and continue to practice their ancestral culture, while others may operate within the United States’ dominant mainstream culture and have a more limited knowledge of cultural practices. There are shared values and attitudes that are common to most Native Americans. However, many traditional customs and practices are tribally specific (such as systems of governance and language). The tribes that have the largest number of people identifying with them are Sioux, Navajo, Choctaw, Chippewa and Cherokee.', 'Racial and Ethnic Relations', 'Multi-ethnic familiarity, tolerance, awareness and acceptance has grown significantly in the United States, as different ethnicities and races have gained prominence in the public sphere. However, there are definitive social tensions around the stigma and social disadvantage faced by certain racial or ethnic identities. Due to the country’s recent history of racial segregation and slavery, conversations about racism are especially sensitive. Immigration is also a sensitive topic commonly igniting public and political debate – with stigma often directed towards the Hispanic and Latino population.', 'Ultimately, ', 'race', ' is a key social and cultural touchstone in the United States, discussed more openly and frequently than is common in many other English-speaking countries. Americans are arguably more attuned to perceived racial slights than people from other English-speaking countries and the terminology used to refer to people of different origins is contested (see ', 'Other Considerations', '). Moreover, it appears the American public has an increasingly pessimistic view of the country’s racial progress.61 National polls conducted in 2019 showed that more adults have a negative view of ', 'race', ' relations than they did 20 years ago, with 65% saying that it has become more common to express racist or racially insensitive views.62,63 More recently, police brutality against black citizens has become a flashpoint for public outrage and discussion on ', 'race', ' relations in America.', ""Individualism and the 'American Dream'"", 'American culture is highly individualistic, whereby people are expected to be self-reliant and independent. There is a strong belief in equal opportunity and ', 'meritocracy', ' – that reward is based on a person’s abilities rather than their wealth or social position. In turn, American society has long promoted the aspirational belief that any individual should have the opportunity to achieve upwards social mobility, prosperity and success, regardless of their social class or place of birth.', 'Known as the ‘', 'American dream', '’, this ideal is powered by the individualist mentality that one’s success is a direct result of their own work. Therefore, ideally anyone should be able to obtain a higher standard of living than their parents if they put in the effort. The American dream is often epitomised by entrepreneurs or ‘self-made men’ who work their way from the bottom of the socioeconomic ladder to the top. It also continues to be expressed by many migrants that view America as the gateway to a better life.', 'However, various studies and public opinion polls show that many Americans are concerned social mobility is becoming less realistic or no longer achievable. While 92% of children born in 1940 ended up in higher income distributions than their parents, this figure was only 40% for those born in the 1980s.64 Moreover, Americans have become more sceptical of the promise of ‘self-made’ success as opportunity for socioeconomic mobility is often dependent on access to previously established privilege, networks or even luck. This pessimism has increased since the Global Financial Crisis of 2007, which saw the American middle class significantly decline; many lower-income families now struggle to rise through the social strata.65', 'Nonetheless, the enduring belief in the American dream implies a sense of optimism toward the future and the possibility of upward social and economic mobility. Paired with the competitiveness of the free market, these ideals can power an achievement fever in the American workforce and economy.66 Today, Americans are renowned for their optimism, opportunism, ', 'individualism', ' and innovative nature. Many people share an emotional desire to continually find and believe in something new.67 This is visible in the way new ideas, opportunities, entrepreneurial ventures and public personalities can gain an eager following in the United States.', '', '_____________________1 Pauls, 20182 Facing History and Ourselves, 20203 Kirsch, 20194 Freese, 20085 Foreman, 20066 Widmer & Erikson, 20177\xa0Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica, 20208 Bains, 20159 Allen & McGuire, 202010\xa0American Enterprise Institute, 201911 Foner, 201812 Keating, 201013 The White House, 202114 Sedensky, 201715 Foner, 201816 Walt, 201117 Edwards, 2018; Kershaw, 201818 Levitz, 201919 Spencer, 201420 Proquest, 201721 Foner, 201822 Thorsett & Kiley, 201723 Hatemi, Plutzer & Berkman, 201924 Foreman, 200625 Widmer & Erikson, 201726 Brenan, 202027 Ibid.28 Widmer & Erikson, 201729 United States Census Bureau, 2019b30 Ibid.31 Ajrouch, 201632 Korelitz, 199733 United States Census Bureau, 2019e34 Picchi, 201935 Emmons, Kent & Ricketts, 201836 Picchi, 201937 United States Census Bureau, 2019a38 United States Census Bureau, 2019e39 United States Census Bureau, 2019c40 United States Census Bureau, 2019d41 United States Census Bureau, 2019c42 United States Census Bureau, 2019f43 United States Census Bureau, 2017 44 United States Census Bureau, 2019b45\xa0Berry, 201746 Ibid.47 Ibid.48 Urofsky, 202149 Horowitz, Brown & Cox, 201950 Tamir, 202151 United States Census Bureau, 2019b52 Budiman & Ruiz, 2021a53 Budiman & Ruiz, 2021b54 Ibid.55 Ibid.56 Ibid.57 Pauls, 201858 United States Census Bureau, 2019e59 Austin, 201360 Ibid.61 Horowitz, Brown & Cox, 201962 Morales, 202063 Horowitz, Brown & Cox, 201964\xa0Chetty et al., 201765\xa0Bains, 201566 Ibid.67 Ibid.']"
american,"['Bolivarian Identity', 'Chavismo', 'Uncertainty Avoidance', 'Pride', 'Class', 'Family Security', 'Warmth', 'Fairness', 'Venezuela (officially the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela) is a country on the northern coast of South America, bordering Colombia, Brazil and Guyana. Its society has been deeply shaped by Spanish ', 'colonisation', ', which introduced Roman Catholicism and the Spanish language. Today, the dominant culture of Venezuela reflects a blend of indigenous and Spanish customs, as well as regional Caribbean and Andean influences. Venezuelans are often described as warm, welcoming and open people. They are generally unified by a shared desire for fairness and equality. This is embodied by the national hero, Simón Bolívar, of whom they are very proud. However, customs and attitudes can vary significantly depending on a person’s class, ', 'ethnicity', ' or locality (e.g. rural or urban). Indeed, perceptions of the culture often especially differ between those from different social and economic classes.', 'Geography and Urbanisation', 'The majority of the Venezuelan population live in urban areas (88.2%), mostly situated in the northern and western highlands.1 Urbanisation has increased in recent decades with the mass rural-to-urban migration leading to the formation of large outer-urban shanty towns surrounding cities. It is estimated over 80% of the population of Caracas live in these neighbourhoods, also known as ', '‘barrios’', '.2 Those living in rural areas often continue to live agriculturally based lifestyles. Roughly, a quarter of land in Venezuela is still used for agricultural purposes.3', 'People often draw cultural distinctions based on geographic divisions in Venezuela, such as differences between the ', '‘Andinos’', ' (people from the Andean region), ', '‘Llaneros’', ' (people from the plains) or ', '‘Orientales’', ' (people from the east). Some of these characteristics are clear to see, while others are maintained through stereotypes often associated with each region. For example, Andinos are often thought to be more religious, reserved and formal. Meanwhile, Llaneros are often described as ‘cowboys’ of the plains.', 'Migration and Ethnic Composition', 'Many aspects of Venezuela’s culture have been shaped by its rich history of migration. The ', 'colonisation', ' period of the 16th century onwards introduced a sizeable Spanish population and a substantial African demographic under slavery schemes. Various other European groups (such as Italians, Germans, French and Portuguese) also arrived. The diverse ethnic composition has greatly contributed to the cultural practices of the country. For example, Spanish is the most widely spoken language. Many other modern cultural forms (such as music and food) are derived from the consolidation of Spanish and Afro-Caribbean traditions with the indigenous culture.', 'Nearly all Venezuelans have mixed heritage in some way. According to the 2011 Venezuelan census, more than half of the population (51.6%) identifies as ', '‘mestizo’', ', meaning they share a mixture of European, ', 'Amerindian', ' or Afro-Caribbean ancestry to some degree. The term ', ""'moreno'\xa0"", ""(literally translating as 'brown’) is more commonly used in day-to-day language when referring to a "", 'mestizo', '/person of mixed ', 'race', ' and is not generally seen as an offensive term. A further 42% of the population identified as ‘white’ (predominantly European heritage), 2.8% as ‘black’ or of African descent and a further 2.7% as indigenous.4 However, it is reported that the estimates of minorities are likely far lower than the actual proportion.5 Other sources estimate nearly a quarter of the population has African ancestry.6', 'Ethnic Identity and Class', 'The national discourse in Venezuela tends to homogenise ethnic belonging. For example, if asked about their ', 'ethnicity', ', people generally describe themselves as being simply “Venezuelan” rather than explaining their exact heritage. There is a sense that, because most people share a mix of white, black and indigenous ancestry to some degree, Venezuelans are one large group of ', 'mestizo', '/moreno people that are ‘racially equal’.7 As such, social disadvantage and discrimination are generally described as a class issue rather than one of ', 'ethnicity', ' or ', 'race', '.8', 'However, there is evidence to suggest that class and ', 'ethnicity', '/', 'race', ' are closely linked in Venezuela. The historical affluence and power of the European colonists over the indigenous population led to centuries of economic, political and social policies that favoured white inheritance of wealth.9 This general pattern has seen those of darker skin to be more economically and socially disadvantaged. Meanwhile, those of lighter complexion are more likely to be in higher socioeconomic and social positions.', 'Members of the traditional elite class often trace their lineage back to wealthy European families and commonly hold positions of power (such as large landowners or oil industry contractors). Meanwhile, most of the rural poor have more dominant indigenous or Afro-Caribbean ancestry. This being said, social mobility became more possible from the 1960s onwards. A new high class has emerged consisting of people who have little connection to the European past, such as company owners that supported the Chavismo movement (see ', 'Political History and Chavismo', ' below).', 'Social Stratifications', 'There are large inequalities of wealth across Venezuela. Social stratifications often permeate social interaction and define opportunities afforded to people. This has often been seen as an inevitable fact of daily life, and has translated into a broad social acceptance of power hierarchies.10 However, such attitudes are changing significantly as the political and economic situation deteriorates. Class has become increasingly politicised as the economic crisis has disadvantaged certain social groups more than others. Today, the ‘elite’ now generally consists of those who have access to international currency and, hence, have more financial mobility.', 'The lowest class is the biggest class, generally made up of rural workers and people with temporary or informal employment (e.g. street vendors or merchants). The middle class used to be primarily made up of well-educated and urbanised people with steady employment. However, distinctions between middle and lower class have become blurred in recent years due to the economic instability and hyperinflation. Many people have had to adapt to the informal economy to create job opportunities for themselves. For example, it is common for people to earn money by lining up all day for food and other basic goods at state stores, which they resell at large mark-ups. These ', '‘bachacos’', '\xa0(ants) form enormous lines all over the country. Today, ', 'social stratification', ' is largely divided between those who line up for goods and those who pay others to line up for them.11', 'Indigenous People of Venezuela', 'Venezuela was originally inhabited by a diverse number of indigenous groups prior to ', 'colonisation', '. These groups practiced various forms of subsistence lifestyles (i.e. sedentary, nomadic or semi-nomadic). Many were hunters and gatherers, such as the Carib people.12 Other groups, such as the Arawak, Sáliva and Chibcha people, were mostly agriculturalists that lived in village communities.13,14 While many Venezuelans would claim to have a degree of indigenous heritage, the practice of indigenous traditions has significantly diminished since Spanish ', 'colonisation', '.', 'The most recent estimates identified 51 distinct indigenous groups, 44 of which are officially recognised by the Venezuelan government.15,16 Some of the largest groups include the Wayuú, Pemón, Warao, Yanomamö and Kariña groups. There are dozens of indigenous languages and dialects spoken throughout the country (some estimate over 70). However, it is estimated only one in ten indigenous Venezuelans speak a language other than Spanish.17 Many indigenous languages are now considered threatened or extinct. Those who speak a native language are usually bilingual in Spanish (often just fluent enough to do business and daily interactions). Many indigenous Venezuelans are concentrated in the south of the country, near and within the Amazon rainforest. For example, the Yanomamö live within the Amazon and are one of the most remote indigenous communities in the world.18 However, the majority of indigenous people now live in urban areas.19', 'Attitudes towards the nation’s colonial history and Christopher Columbus have changed over time. In 2004, the anniversary of Christopher Columbus’ arrival was renamed as the “Day of Indigenous Resistance” in recognition of the devastating impact the ‘discovery’ of the Americas brought upon the indigenous people of the region. This movement has led to more anti-colonial activism. The national education curriculum now also highlights the destructive aspects of colonialism. Despite increased formal recognition, the indigenous people of Venezuela continue to be significantly disadvantaged across many population measurements.20', 'Bolivarian Identity', 'Venezuela achieved independence from Spain in 1821 after Simón Bolívar united the areas of present-day Venezuela, Colombia, Panama and Ecuador to lead the movement (as well as parts of Peru, Guyana and Brazil). This independence movement, ‘', 'Gran Colombia’', ', gave rise to modern ', 'Latin America', ' and also ended slavery in the region. Simón Bolívar (also known as ‘The Liberator’) is widely considered a hero in the region and equally loved across the political spectrum for taking a stand against the ', 'hierarchy', ', slavery, inequality and segregation of the colonial period. His legacy informs a large part of the Venezuelan national identity, representing many of the values Venezuelans hold very close. He is often idolised as an underdog figure and admired for forfeiting his privileged upbringing to fight for principles of fairness and equality.', 'The symbolism of Simón Bolívar has grown in Venezuela with the popularity and rise of Hugo Chavéz (see ', 'Political History and Chavismo', ' below). His administration initiated the “Bolivarian Revolution”, renaming the country (the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela), rewriting the Constitution (the Bolivarian Constitution 1999) and introducing socialist policy in Simón Bolívar’s name. This use of the name and imagery of Bolivar activated the collective warmth that Venezuelans have towards their national hero. However, those who oppose Chavéz may feel Bolívar’s image has been distorted by Chavismo (see ', 'Political History and Chavismo', ""). Generally, a Venezuelan's attitude on this generally varies depending on their political preferences."", 'Political History and Chavismo', ""It is important to understand the political history of Venezuela as the events of recent decades have drastically changed society and inform the current situation. Venezuela was widely considered one of South America's wealthiest and safest countries throughout the 20th century. A lot of the nation’s wealth stemmed from its large oil reserves, which are the largest in the world.21 However, the country has also struggled with widespread corruption."", 'In 1999, Hugo Chavéz came into power promising a social transformation to tackle inequality and corruption. His presidency lasted for 14 years until his death in 2013, during which time he embarked on a socialist project and enacted sweeping reforms. A key belief of his left-wing ideology (referred to as ‘Chavismo’) was that the state should support social welfare programs for its citizens and represent the needs of the poor. Among a suite of policies, the government nationalised many private industries (including the oil industry) and invested oil revenue into social services, health care and education, reducing poverty rates by about 20% during his presidency.22', ""Hugo Chavéz’s policies have had deep, influential impacts across the country and increasingly polarised the Venezuelan population. Political ideologies in Venezuela often remain largely divided between “pro-” or “anti-Chavista” attitudes. Chavéz’s rule became more controversial as he expanded the scope and power of the presidency (removing a chamber of congress, ending presidential term limits and reducing civilian control of the military). Nevertheless, he particularly appealed to a large socially marginalised and disenfranchised demographic in the lower class. He is still revered by many as an almost mythical figure, referred to by some as the 'supreme commander' of Venezuela. The "", 'Chavismo\xa0', 'movement and ideology continues to be upheld by his former vice president, Nicolás Maduro. Maduro was elected as Chavéz’s successor in 2013 following his death and is seen by many as his spiritual son. However, his popularity has diminished since the economic crisis (see ', 'The Crisis', ' below).', 'The Crisis', 'At the time of writing, Venezuela is going through some of the toughest times in the country’s history. In 2014, a decrease in global oil prices saw Venezuela experience a large economic crisis. As the country’s oil reserves had been nationalised under Chavéz’s administration, this left the country’s economy vulnerable to the rising and falling global price of oil. This crisis was exacerbated by mismanagement of state-owned companies and industries. Hyperinflation soared, leading to a goods shortage. The political and economic situation has only worsened in the years since.', 'Almost every aspect of life has been disrupted by the crisis, leading to poverty and mass migration. Hyperinflation has led to a dramatic drop in living standards with basic goods and services becoming hard to access or unavailable (e.g. food, electricity, health care, water). Ultimately, the country is facing a humanitarian crisis of massive proportions. As of 2019, the UN estimates nearly 94% of the country’s population are living below the poverty line.23 More than half of Venezuelan families do not have enough income to meet basic food needs, with roughly 75% of people having lost significant weight due to hunger since 2017.24,25 It is estimated that hospitals lack access to 85% of basic medicines.26 Over 3 million Venezuelans have left to neighbouring countries and beyond, including 20% of the nation’s doctors.27 The exodus of Venezuelan nationals is already one of the largest in the modern history of ', 'Latin America', ' and the Caribbean, with the UN estimating this number will rise to 5.3 million by the end of 2019.28', ""Since the economic crisis began in 2014, there have been widespread protests and political agitation. However, Maduro’s leadership style has become increasingly authoritarian. Most protests and political demonstrations (both violent and non-violent) have been met with repression from the state, leading to loss of life in many cases. Maduro won another presidential term in May 2018 despite calls for his removal. In January 2019, the leader of the opposition government, Juan Guaidó, challenged Maduro's claim to the presidency and declared himself the acting president. This sparked a crisis concerning who is the legitimate President of Venezuela."", 'Current Attitudes', 'It is important not to presume a Venezuelan’s political position. Every person has a different explanation as to why things have happened. Strongly held views have divided the country (even families) and can easily ignite emotions. Some Venezuelans would consider themselves to be living in a dictatorship, while others would describe it as a socialist country. Regardless of their position, most people generally feel disenfranchised and let down by the political leadership of both sides. For example, many Venezuelans now blame Nicolás Maduro for the mismanagement of the crisis, including some of those who originally supported Chavéz. One may hear people call the political revolution a ', '“robo-lution”', ' (“', 'robo', '” meaning “steal” in Spanish).', 'While many political opinions may circulate, most Venezuelans are primarily concerned with restoring social normalcy, security and economic stability. Those living overseas often express sadness over the fact that many aspects of their culture that they miss and remember have been changed by the crisis. Challenges also arise as it is very difficult for the Venezuelan ', 'diaspora', ' living overseas to get accurate updates on the situation (it can change rapidly week to week). Many also feel that there is not enough awareness of the severity of the crisis in the West (foreign journalists in Venezuela are banned from reporting on the crisis).29 It is common for people to shake their heads and suppress their despair with dry humour when the inevitable discussion about politics arises.', 'Daily Life', 'The tough economic conditions have influenced a rise in violence and crime (both anarchic and organised). This insecurity has increased danger to personal safety, impacting the social atmosphere and daily life. For example, it is quite unsafe for a group of women to walk down the street unchaperoned at night in Caracas, whereas this would have been commonplace behaviour not long ago. People often have to restrict their movements to avoid crimes of opportunity. It is common for friends and family members to stay in close contact with one another.', 'This social climate has exacerbated a high level of ', 'uncertainty avoidance', ' in Venezuelans’ daily life. People tend to avoid ambiguity in their lives and institutions, and desire choices that offer stability.30 Decisions may be made with immediate results in mind (rather than long-term goals) as insecure conditions can make it hard to plan very far ahead into the future. Venezuelans tend to favour open and honest business dealings as transparency minimises the possibility of uncertain situations. Ultimately, people are mostly concerned with ensuring their family’s security as much as possible in the short term.', 'Interaction and Socialisation', 'Despite the country’s current challenges, Venezuelans continue to have a spontaneous and fun cultural spirit. They are also very flexible and adaptable people, able to find positives and commonalities even if the situation is bad. Such characteristics are often noticeable in the ', 'expatriate', ' populations living in other countries. Venezuelans are commonly optimistic and value a healthy work/life balance, thinking of leisure time as important. This attitude towards life is also reflected in the festivals and holidays that are commonly celebrated in Venezuela. Regional and national festivals are often celebrated with parades, musical performances, dancing, costumes and parties, such as religious celebrations like the Fiesta de San Juan and the celebration of Corpus Christi. These also reflect the high value Venezuelans place on the traditions of the past.', '', '_____________________', '1 Central Intelligence Agency, 20182 Foreign Correspondent, 20173 Central Intelligence Agency, 20184\xa0National Statistics Institute of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, 2014\xa05\xa0Minority Rights Group International, 2017a6 Page, 20157 Telles and Bailey, 20138 Sáenz and Rodríguez, 20159\xa0Page, 201510\xa0Hofstede Insights, 201811\xa0Lonely Planet, 201912\xa0Encyclopedia Britannica, 201913\xa0Encyclopedia Britannica, 200614\xa0Encyclopedia Britannica, 201115\xa0Minority Rights Group International, 2017a16\xa0Reuters, 201117\xa0Minority Rights Group International, 2017a18\xa0Minority Rights Group International, 2017b19\xa0Minority Rights Group International, 2017a20\xa0Minority Rights Group International, 2017a21\xa0OPEC, 201822\xa0Labrador, 201923\xa0Nichols, 201924\xa0Caraballo-Arias, Madrid & Barrios, 201825\xa0Pestano, 201726\xa0Labrador, 201927\xa0UNHCR, 201928\xa0UNHCR, 201929 Foreign Correspondent, 201730\xa0Hofstede Insights, 2018']"
