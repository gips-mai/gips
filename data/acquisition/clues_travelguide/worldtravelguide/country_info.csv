africa,algeria,"For the intrepid traveller, adventure awaits in Algeria. A beguiling blend of cultures, landscapes and traditions, this vast chunk of land contains everything from tranquil fishing ports and bustling cities to the unmatched drama of the Sahara Desert and Hoggar Mountains. As the largest country in Africa, Algeria’s terrain is hugely varied yet underexplored: few visitors travel beyond the country’s Mediterranean port cities (namely Oran and the capital, Algiers), which lie amidst fertile land and the scattered vestiges of Phoenician and Roman colonies. Sometimes called ‘Algiers the White,’ the capital’s bustling showpiece is its UNESCO-listed Casbah. This whitewashed medina encompasses both crumbling ruins and newly-renovated spaces and is well worth a visit despite its shady reputation (taking a guide is recommended). The ancient port city of Oran has a decidedly European vibe: French colonial influences are evident in everything from the soaring Sacré-Cœur Cathedral (now a library) to the richly ornamented Palais de la Culture. The city has long been a popular trading post and remains one of the busiest ports in North Africa. The Sahara Desert is Algeria’s defining feature and one of its biggest drawing cards. It covers more than four-fifths of the country and is the source of myriad myths and legends. Nomadic Berbers still live here, eking out traditional lives in difficult conditions. The security situation makes independent travel difficult in the Sahara, but under the guidance of reputable tour operators, travellers can visit attractions like the oasis towns of Ghardia and Timimoun, or venture deep into the heart of the desert to view the prehistoric rock art in the Hoggar Mountains and Tassili N’Ajjer National Park.  The desert is also home to the world’s most remote film festival. FiSahara takes place annually in the Wilaya of Dakhla, a Western Sahara refugee camp, to highlight the plight of the Sahrawi people. War and tumultuous politics have deterred many from visiting Algeria – rerouting them towards Morocco instead – but if you’re looking for a North African destination with a difference, this country has much to offer. 2,381,741 sq km (919,595 sq miles). 40,375,954 (UN estimate 2016). 16.6 per sq km. Algiers. Republic. President Abdelmadjid Tebboune since 2019. Prime Minister Nadir Larbaoui since 2023.","Having won independence from France in 1962 following a bloody War of Independence that remains the defining event of the country’s modern history, Algeria has had a dramatic and rocky first half-century of going it alone. Following a secular, socialist path throughout the 1970s and 1980s to keep the simmering Arab-Berber tensions at bay, the country nevertheless became mired in popular discontent by the late 1980s. In the 1990s, Algerian politics was dominated by a bloody struggle between the military and Islamic militants that engulfed much of the county and caused huge loss of life. The civil war petered out by 2002, when Abdelaziz Bouteflika, formerly Algeria's long-standing and respected foreign minister, was elected Algeria’s president, a role he has held ever since. Bouteflika has run the country with an iron hand ever since, and while being no democrat, he has arguably brought the country something it needs far more in the short term – stability and peace. As well as its problems with Islamic militants, the government has also been confronted with agitation from the country's Berber ethnic minority pressing for greater cultural and political recognition, which have resulted in limited concessions to their demands such as Tamazight, the Berber tongue, being recognised as an official national language. Algeria today is largely stable, with the problems of violence and kidnapping that have plagued it for long now consigned to the past. President Bouteflika won his third term in office in 2009 and while democracy and human rights continue to suffer under his rule, most Algerians are simply glad that the country is a functioning entity and the economy finally growing again. 99% of the population adhere to Islam. Courtesy should be adopted with new acquaintances. The provision and acceptance of hospitality are as important a part of Algerian culture as elsewhere in the Arab world. In the main cities, the urban population lives at a frantic pace much akin to European urban dwellers, but in the south and in rural areas people are much more open and friendly. Algerian women are expected to dress modestly in rural areas but this is not necessary in Algiers. Tourist visits should be avoided during Ramadan. Military installations and personnel should not be photographed. Police roadblocks are frequent – slow down and follow their instructions very carefully and respectfully should you be driving around the country. Always carry your passport or identification papers with you. The official languages are Arabic and Berber (Tamazight), but French is still used for most official and business transactions. Berber (Amazigh) is spoken in the northern mountainous regions of the Kabylias and the Aures and also in the south. In general, English is spoken only in major business or tourist centres.","Summer temperatures are high throughout the country, particularly in the south where it is both very dry and very hot. During this time, road travel is difficult and air travel prone to delay because of sandstorms. Northern cities have high humidity, while those along the coast are cooled by sea breezes. In the winter, the oases of the far south are pleasant and attract many visitors. The desert temperature drops dramatically at night. North of the Sahara, temperatures are very mild from September to May and vary little between day and night. South of the Sahara, temperatures are pleasant from October to April, but there are great variations between day and night. Coastal towns are prone to storms from the sea. Rainfall is relatively low throughout the country and in the far south it is virtually unknown. Cotton and linen lightweights are best for winter months and for evenings in desert areas. Woollens and light rainwear are advised for the winter along the coast and the Hauts Plateaux. Remember that desert temperatures can drop very low during the night, so don't get caught out with only flimsy layers. South of the Sahara, from mid-December to mid-January, temperatures drop and warm clothes are necessary both in the morning and the evening. A mountain sleeping bag is also required when camping. Algeria is situated along the North African coast, bordered to the east by Tunisia and Libya, to the southeast by Niger, to the southwest by Mali, and to the west by Mauritania and Morocco. It is Africa's second-largest country with 1,200km (750 miles) of coastline. Along the coastal strip are the main towns, fertile land, beach resorts and 90% of the population. Further south lies the area of the Hauts Plateaux mountains of up to 2,000m (6,600ft) covered in cedar, pine and cypress forests with broad arable plains dividing the plateaux. The remaining 85% of the country is the Sahara Desert in its various forms, sustaining only 500,000 people, many of whom are nomadic tribes with goat and camel herds. The Sahara region contains two mountain ranges: the dramatic Hoggar massif, rising to almost 3,000m (9,800ft) and the Tassili N’Ajjer. Both are scenically stunning and offer some of the best desert landscapes in the world."
africa,angola,"Its name may be synonymous with strife, but since the civil war ended in 2002 Angola has been enjoying something of a renaissance. Safe and welcoming, this friendly nation transports the laidback, community-orientated lifestyle of southern Portugal to continental Africa – and travellers are once again discovering its charms. Most enter the country via the capital, Luanda, which has the dubious and surprising distinction of being the most expensive city in the world. With its gleaming skyscrapers, grand government buildings and palm-lined promenades, downtown Luanda’s prosperity probably comes as a revelation to many visitors. But the spoils of Angola’s considerable oil wealth soon give way to unofficial shantytowns, proving that not everyone is benefitting from the black gold rush. It is along Angola’s stunning 1,700 km (1,000 mile) coastline, in cities like Luanda, where Portugal’s colonial influences are most striking. The faded, art deco splendour of cities like Benguela and Namibe provide a welcome distraction from the country’s sandy shores. Further inland, the landscape becomes one of almost endless plains. Here remote national parks are slowly being restocked with wildlife, while the newly renovated Benguela railway wends through the seemingly endless countryside. One of the world’s most evocative rail journeys, riding through the landscape with its people is a great way to delve into the psyche of laughter loving Angolans. To the north – and separated from the rest of Angola by a 40 km (25 mile) arm of the Democratic Republic of Congo – the exclave of Cabinda is Angola in miniature, with empty beaches once popular with expats, elegant towns and virgin rainforest full of wildlife. Youthful and energetic, Angola, like its people, has its own way of doing things. Fun-loving and eager to impress, it is a country still shaking off its troubled past while looking firmly at the future. 1,246,700 sq km (481,354 sq miles). 25,830,958 (UN estimate 2016). 15.7 per sq km. Luanda. Republic. President João Lourenço since September 2017. President João Lourenço since September 2017.","Much of the land occupied by present day Angola was part of the Kingdom of Kongo, which rose to prominence in the 14th century. It was flourishing a century later, when Portuguese explorers reached the country and set up their first trading post at Soyo in the far north of the country. Relations between the Europeans and the Kongo kings were good, allowing the foundation of Luanda by Paulo Dias de Novias with one hundred settler families and 400 soldiers in 1575. The kings' sons were sent to Lisbon for education until the 17th century, after which the transatlantic slave trade soured trust between the two kingdoms. An estimated one million slaves were shipped to Portuguese Brazil between the 16th and 17th centuries from Angola. The formal abolition of the transatlantic trade in 1836, following Brazilian independence, resulted in the Portuguese intensifying colonisation of its other territories, including Angola. Slavery in Portuguese colonies continued officially until the 1870s and thereafter, barely disguised, until the early 20th century. It was not until the fascist government took power in Lisbon in 1926 that Portuguese rule was further consolidated with the administrative control of Angola’s interior, even despite earlier territorial claims and the importance of the Angolan coast to the Portuguese economy. Opposition to colonisation remained relatively muted until the 1950s. The war for independence erupted in 1961, and didn’t end until Portugal’s Marcelo Caetano regime was overthrown in a coup d’état in 1974. However, instead of unification, independence the following year led to an enhancement of the divisions between different liberation movements, laying the foundations for a civil war that consumed Angola for almost three decades. The half a million Portuguese citizens that had remained in Angola through the independence struggles finally threw in their lot and returned to Europe, creating a massive skills shortage and leaving a country rich in resources struggling with bankruptcy. A ceasefire in 2002 finally stabilised the country, permitting democratic elections. Did you know? • President Jose Eduardo dos Santos has led Angola since 1979, making him one of the longest serving leaders anywhere in the world. • The name Angola derives from the word ‘ngola’, meaning king. • The country’s first president, Agostinho Neto, was awarded the Soviet Union’s Lenin Peace Prize for 1975-76, despite the outbreak of the Angolan Civil War. Roman Catholic (38%), Protestant (15%) and local animist beliefs (47%). Normal social courtesies should be observed. Drug trafficking or carrying incurs severe penalties. Homosexuality is illegal. Photography: It is inadvisable to photograph public places, public buildings or public events. Copies of photography permits should be deposited with your embassy; permits should be carried at all times.   The official language is Portuguese. African languages (especially Umbundu, Kimbundu, Kikongo and Bantu) are spoken by the majority of the population.","The north of the country is hot and wet during the summer months (November to April); winters are slightly cooler and mainly dry. The south is hot throughout much of the year with a slight decrease in temperature in winter (May to October). Overall, the best time to visit Angola is from June to September when rainfall is low and days are warm and sunny.   Lightweight cottons and linens throughout the year in the south. Tropical clothing for summers in the north. Nights can be cold, so warm clothing should be taken. Waterproofing is advisable for the rainy season throughout the country. Angola is bordered by the Democratic Republic of Congo to the north, Zambia to the east, Namibia to the south and the Atlantic Ocean to the west. Mountains rise from the coast, levelling to a plateau which makes up most of the country. The country is increasingly arid towards the south; the far south is on the edge of the Namib Desert. The northern plateau is thickly vegetated. Cabinda is a small enclave to the north of Angola proper, surrounded by the territories of the Democratic Republic of Congo and the Congo. The discovery of large oil deposits off the coast of the enclave has led to it becoming the centre of Angola's foreign business interests. The oil industry is based primarily at Malongo."
africa,benin,"In many ways Benin is the perfect introduction to Africa. A land of pristine beaches, bountiful wildlife and hospitable inhabitants, travelling around the country is a doddle thanks to its small size and advanced infrastructure. The birthplace of voodoo and one of the major departure points for the more than eight million people forced to leave the continent as slaves, the country also has a complex and compelling history that filters down into everyday life to create a jumble of the familiar and the strange. Stay in the south to experience Benin’s major cities, the slightly chaotic yet vibrant commercial hub of Cotonou and the laidback capital Porto Novo. Take some time out from the capital’s lagoon-side location and palm-fringed Atlantic beaches to request an audience with the tribal princes of Ajase, Porto Novo’s ancestral name, while visiting the palace museum. Head along the coast to experience the unique lives of the Tofinu people at Ganvié, a bamboo stilt village often referred to as the “Venice of Africa.” Or take advantage of Benin’s small size and good roads to explore the country’s spectacular countryside, which harbours remote towns and exquisite national parks. Home to lions, hippos and elephants, not to mention myriad bird species, Benin’s flagship national park is Pendjari, which serves up spectacular fauna without the crowds. A thriving arts scene across the country has given rise to stunning public sculptures and fantastic architecture, which complement the elegance of the wooden Afro-Brazilian mansions of Porto Novo and Ouidah. The latter is the beating heart of Benin’s voodoo practitioners and an important stop for those interested in the history of the Atlantic slave trade. Small in size but not in stature, Benin has something to suit every interest, be it the wild landscapes of the north, the bustling metropolises of the south, or the shared religion and history that bind this country and its people together. 112,622 sq km (43,484 sq miles). 11,166,658 (UN estimate 2016). 92.8 per sq km. Porto-Novo. Republic. President Patrice Talon since 2016. Vacant.","Benin was the seat of one of the great medieval African kingdoms. During the 13th century, the indigenous Edo people were run by a group of local chieftains. However, by the 15th century, a single ruler, known as the oba, had asserted control. Under the dynasty established by Ewuare the Great, Benin's territory expanded to cover a region between the Niger Delta and what is now the Nigerian city of Lagos. The obas brought great prosperity and a highly organised state to Benin. French colonisation came in 1872 and in 1904 the territory was incorporated into French West Africa as Dahomey. In 1958, it became the République du Dahomey, self-governing within the French community and gained full independence from France on 1 August 1960. A succession of military coups brought about many changes of government; the last of these brought to power Major Mathieu Kérékou. The new ruler, who was at the head of a regime professing strict Marxist-Leninist principles, remained in power until the beginning of the 1990s, when the Kérékou government introduced a new democratic constitution and held presidential and legislative elections. It made Benin the first African country to successfully effect the transition from dictatorship to a pluralistic political system where the president heads the government, the state and the military, and appoints members of the cabinet. Kérékou's principal opponent at the presidential poll, and the ultimate victor, was then Prime Minister Nicéphore Soglo. Political newcomer Yayi Boni won the second round of presidential elections in 2006, gaining roughly three quarters of the vote. He went on to win re-election without a runoff vote in 2011, the first president to do so since the reestablishment of democracy in 1991. Did you know? • Though Benin has been a French colonial possession for much of its recent history, Ouidah’s São João fort remained Portuguese territory from 1721 until 1961. • The capital since 1900, Porto Novo actually has three names. It is also known as Adjatche and Hogbonou. • Benin has never won an Olympic medal, in either the summer or winter games. 35% animist/traditional, 35% Christian (mainly Roman Catholic) and the majority of the rest are Muslim. Normal courtesies are appreciated; it is customary to shake hands on arrival and departure. However, religious beliefs play a large part in society and these should be respected. Voodoo is perhaps the most striking and best-known practice, and has acquired considerable social and political power. Only priests can communicate with voodoos and spirits of the dead. If travelling, it is advisable to clear itineraries with district or provincial authorities. Casual wear is acceptable in most places. The official language is French. However, many ethnic groups have their own languages: Bariba and Fulani are spoken in the north, Fon and Yoruba in the south. Some English is also spoken.","The south has an equatorial climate with four seasons. It is hot and dry from January to April and during August, with rainy seasons through May to July and September to December. The north has more extreme temperatures, hot and dry between November and June, cooler and very wet between July and October. Lightweight cottons and linens. A light raincoat or an umbrella isnecessary in rainy seasons and warmer clothes are advised for coolevenings. Benin is situated in West Africa and is bordered to the east by Nigeria, to the north by Niger and Burkina Faso, and to the west by Togo. Benin stretches 700km (435 miles) from the Bight of Benin to the Niger River. The coastal strip is sandy with coconut palms. Beyond the lagoons of Porto Novo, Nokoue, Ouidah and Grand Popo is a plateau rising gradually to the heights of the Atakora Mountains. From the highlands run two tributaries of the Niger, while southwards the Ouémé flows down to Nokoue lagoon. Mono River flows into the sea at Grand Popo and forms a frontier with Togo."
africa,botswana,"Easily one of best safari destinations in Africa, Botswana is a wild and dramatic land characterised not only by its bountiful wildlife, but also by its extraordinary scenery: from shimmering salt pans and diamond-rich deserts to raging rivers and fertile flood plains, the landscapes here come in many guises. Nearly half of the country is given over to national parks, reserves and private concessions, which makes for an excellent safari experience. Botswana’s policy of favouring low-impact luxury tourism ensures that even the most famous game-viewing areas rarely feel crowded, while its population of just two million adds to the sense of wilderness. The north of Botswana in particular offers superb wildlife-watching opportunities. It is home to the wondrous Okavango Delta – the largest inland delta in the world – where shimmering lagoons and fertile waterways are crammed with more than 400 species of bird. Away from the water zebras and giraffes amble across grass flats and flood plains, keeping an eye out for the numerous big predators that also reside here. Northeast of Okavango is another jewel in Botswana’s crown: Chobe National Park, which has one of the largest concentrations of game anywhere in Africa. The reserve is particularly well known for its vast elephant herds, some 400-strong, which share this wild land with the likes of lions, cheetahs, hippos and many more. It’s not only in conservation that Botswana is an African success story. Since gaining independence in 1966, it has achieved steady economic growth through good use of its agricultural potential and enviable diamond reserves. It has not entirely escaped controversy – the HIV/AIDS pandemic and alleged maltreatment of the Kalahari Bushmen have caused international concern – but it remains a peaceful and stable nation of remarkable natural beauty and its developed infrastructure makes it much more accessible than some of its neighbours. 581,730 sq km (224,607 sq miles). 2,291,661 (2017). 3.8 per sq km. Gaborone. Parliamentary republic. President Mokgweetsi Masisi since 2018. President Mokgweetsi Masisi since 2018.","The first people to settle in Botswana were the San Bushmen, nomadic hunter-gatherers whose territories are also thought to have spanned present-day Namibia, Angola, South Africa, Zambia and Zimbabwe. Their influence is still evident in southern Africa, where these indigenous inhabitants eke out traditional lives as hunter-gatherer. Examples of their early rock art are also still visible across the region. From the 17th century the San Bushmen started to come under pressure from migrating Bantu tribes, who had migrated from sub-Saharan Africa. A further series of migrations followed and by the 18th century these migrants were firmly established in the southern part of Botswana, and had established a powerful military state controlling hunting, cattle-breeding and copper mining. The 19th century brought another period of upheaval, as inhabitants from the north of the continent, dislocated by slavery and the collapse of their local economies, moved to new territories. British colonialists and Boer settlers then came along and vied for control of Botswana; the local rulers allied themselves with the British against the Boers, and Botswana was eventually brought under British protectorate control in 1890, remaining so until independence in 1966. Popular Seretse Khama became the country's first president – a position he held until his death in 1980 – and subsequent elections have remained peaceful and democratic. In the late 1960s, diamonds were discovered in Botswana and became the primary driving factor for the country’s economic growth and independence. These riches have, unlike in other parts of Africa, helped the country become a veritable African success story. During the 1980s and 1990s, Botswana was an important player in South Africa’s apartheid struggle, providing refuge for a number of guerrilla fighters and political exiles. Today, Botswana’s key domestic priority is to tackle the AIDS pandemic. Botswana's infection rate, estimated at 25 per cent of the total population, is among the world's highest. For any persisting issues, under current president Ian Khama, first elected in 2008, Botswana continues to be a shining light of peaceful, non-racial, multi-party democracy on the African continent. Did you know? • The Jwaneng diamond mine, located in the south of the country, is the world’s richest diamond mine. • The word lekgoa, which locals often use to refer to foreigners, literally translates as ‘spat out by the sea’. • The wife of Botswana’s first president, Seretse Khama, and mother of current president, Ian Khama, was an English woman named Ruth Williams.   Christianity, Roman Catholic and indigenous beliefs. There are numerous small Zionist and Apostolic churches in rural villages, as well as United Reformed (Congregational and Methodist), Dutch Reformed, Lutheran, Methodist and Anglican churches, and predominantly expatriate Muslim, Quaker, Hindu and Bahai congregations in major towns. As most people in Botswana follow their traditional pattern of life, visitors should be sensitive to customs which will inevitably be unfamiliar to them. Outside urban areas and safari destinations, people may well not be used to visitors. Casual clothing is acceptable and, in urban centres, normal courtesies should be observed.Photography: Airports, official residences and defence establishments should not be photographed. Permission should be obtained to photograph local people. English is the official language. Setswana is the national language, with minorities speaking Kalanga and Sekgalagadi.","The landlocked Botswana is semi-arid and has two main seasons: wet and dry. The dry season is from May to October. This is peak season for wildlife safari as animals are much easier to spot because the vegetation is less dense, and animals tend to congregate around waterholes. Temperatures are around 25°C (77°F), but they are at least 10 degrees cooler in the south. The Kalahari Desert, in the southwest, may experience cold and frosty early mornings and evenings too. The wet season is from November to April. November can be very hot and humid, while January and February are the wettest months. Some safari lodges and camps are closed during this period too. If you are visiting the Okavango Delta and Chobe National Park, the months from June to September are the best time. Loose, natural fabrics are recommended, with wet-weather gear and warmer clothes according to the season and area visiting. Botswana is landlocked, bordered to the south and east by South Africa, to the northeast by Zimbabwe and to the north and west by Namibia. It also touches Zambia just west of the Victoria Falls. The tableland of the Kalahari Desert covers the centre and south. The principal wildlife areas are the Okavango Delta to the northwest, the largest inland delta in the world, which includes the Moremi Game Reserve; Chobe National Park in the north, including Savute and the Linyanti Marshes; and Kgalagadi Transfrontier National Park in the far southwest, co-managed with South Africa. The majority of the population lives in the southeast around Gaborone, Serowe and Kanye along the South African border. The vast arid sandveld of the Kalahari occupies much of central and western Botswana. The seasonal rains bring a considerable difference to the vegetation, especially in the Makgadikgadi Pans and the Okavango Delta."
africa,burkina-faso,"On the face of it you can see why Burkina Faso lacks mainstream appeal: a landlocked West African nation with rowdy neighbours, this country has a harsh climate, unforgiving geography and an infrastructure few would want to be at the mercy of. Set piece attractions are also lacking. Yet Burkina Faso remains an enthralling destination for intrepid travellers, thanks to its wonderful inhabitants and dramatic landscapes. As such, the country, though not frequently visited, is a fine place in which to immerse yourself in West African culture. Meaning “land of the honest people,” Burkina Faso proudly proclaims to be one of the friendliest countries in Africa – and visitors are sure of a warm welcome. Burkinabé, as the people of Burkina Faso are known, are the exact opposite of the harsh land that they inhabit – and it is these cordial and courteous people who make coming here such a joy. Burkina Faso’s traditional cultures are best sampled in its two largest cities: the fabulously named capital, Ouagadougou (also known as “Ouaga”) and the second city of Bobo-Dioolasso (simply referred to as “Bobo”). Both have large communities of artists, particularly Ouagadougou, which is famed for its music scene. The art and architecture of the capital are also worthy of attention, with several largescale sculptures enlivening the streets. Away from the cities, Burkina Faso’s four national parks harbour a surprising diversity of wildlife. If you can’t explore them all, then do make a beeline for Arli, which is home a wide range of ecosystems and is an important habitat for West Africa’s last big cats and elephants. Hippos, monkeys and various exotic bird species also call this national park home. Burkina Faso might not suit first time travellers, but for hardy adventurers this is a destination in which to veer off the tourist trail and discover the hidden gems of West Africa. 274,200 sq km (105,870 sq miles). 18,633,725 (UN estimate 2016). 69 per sq km.

Prime Minister Albert Ouedraogo since 2022.","Burkina Faso was once a part of the Great Mossi Empire, one of the strongest of ancient African kingdoms. The Mossi Empire was still in place when the whole region was annexed by the French in 1896. After a period as part of the colony of Upper Senegal-Niger, the territory was reorganised as the separate colony of Upper Volta in 1919. It was then carved up between Côte d'Ivoire, Niger and French Sudan (now Mali) in 1932, only to be reconstituted as an independent entity in 1947, as a French Overseas Territory. Internal self-government was granted in 1957, with full independence (as Upper Volta) following three years later. The early years of independence were largely dominated by the military, notably the regime of General Sangoule J Lamizana, who ousted the civilian government of Maurice Yameogo in 1966 and ruled until 1980. Lamizana was followed by another military government, followed in turn by a rebellion in 1983, which brought a group of young radical officers to power under the leadership of Thomas Sankara, who changed the country’s name to Burkina Faso the following year. The Sankara government laid down a new political direction for the country, which had previously pursued a capitalist scheme of economic development. Particular emphasis was put on the development of the rural economy. However, growing tensions within the ruling National Revolutionary Council came to a violent climax in October 1987, when Sankara was killed in a revolt led by his second-in-command, Captain Blaise Compaoré. Under pressure from the international community and in particular France, a pluralist system of government was adopted in 1991. Elections in 1998 and 2000 returned Compaoré and his party with substantial majorities but their integrity was undermined by opposition boycotts amid allegations of fraud and malpractice. He was eventually overthrown by popular revolt in October 2014 after attempting to extend his 27-year rule. Since Compaoré’s overthrow, the country is returning to democratic principles, despite a couple of further false starts, with the support of the African Union and regional body ECOWAS. Did you know? •	Burkina Faso roughly translates as ‘land of the upright people’. •	The country is home to 63 different ethnic groups. •	Burkina Faso has one of the highest fertility rates on earth, with the population increasing five-fold since independence. More than 40% follow animist beliefs; 50% are Muslim and 10% Christian (mostly Roman Catholic). Women are always expected to dress modestly since this is a Muslim country. Within the urban areas, many French customs prevail. Dress should be casual and appropriate for hot weather (yet short skirts and shorts are best avoided). Lounge suits for men and formal wear for women are required for evening entertainment. Burkina Faso is a fascinating country because of its diversity: over 60 ethnic groups dwell in this country, proud to be Burkinabé, and yet keen to preserve their own social and cultural idiosyncrasies. Outside the cities, little has changed for centuries and visitors should respect local customs and traditions. The official language is French. Several other languages such as Mossi, Mooré, Dioula, Peul, Fulfuldé and Gourmantché are also spoken.","Tropical. The dry season lasts from November to March and the rainy season from June to October. The best months are November to February when the Harmattan wind blows from the east producing dry and cool weather. However if you have allergies, avoid December to February as the Harmattan turns Burkina Faso into a dust bowl. Rainfall is highest in the southwest and lowest in the northeast. Avoid travelling in late March to May as the climate is too hot and dry to bear even for the locals. Lightweights and rainwear for the rainy season. Plenty of scarves and handkerchiefs are recommended during the months when the Harmattan blows. Burkina Faso is situated in West Africa and bordered to the north and west by Mali, to the east by Niger, to the southeast by Benin and to the south by Togo, Ghana and Côte d'Ivoire. The southern part of the country, less arid than the north, is wooded savannah, gradually drying out into sand and desert in the north. The Sahara desert is relentlessly moving south, however, stripping the savannah lands of trees and slowly turning the thin layer of cultivatable soil into sun-blackened rock-hard lakenite. Three great rivers, the Mouhoun, Nazinon and Nakambé (Black, Red and White Volta), water the great plains. The population does not live in the valleys along the river banks due to the diseases prevalent there."
africa,burundi,"For all its wondrous landscapes (think undulating mountain ranges, dense rainforests and shimmering lakes), travellers are advised to steer clear of Burundi right now – the scenery might be beautiful, but the political situation is decidedly ugly. Civil unrest, an abortive military coup and controversial elections have dominated the headlines in Burundi recently, which is a great shame given what this country has to offer. The vibrant if tumultuous capital, Bujumbura, has a prime location on the shores of Lake Tanganyika and just outside the city are some of the best inland beaches in Africa, plus a number of idyllic beachfront bars and resorts. The city itself has some interesting examples of French architecture and has developed a reputation for its vibrant nightlife, but infrastructural development has been hindered by decades of sporadic conflict that culminated in 1994 and left more than 300,000 dead. Further beyond the city limits, the four beautiful waterfalls at Chutes de la Karera are well worth a visit, as are a few of the largely unexplored and underdeveloped national parks. Parc National de la Rusiza is the most accessible, just 15km (9 miles) from Bujumbura, while Parc National de la Kibira is the largest rainforest in Burundi and is home to rare colobus monkeys and chimpanzees. An advantage of Burundi’s small size is that if you have your own vehicle or hire a driver, it’s generally easy to visit any of these highlights and return to Bujumbura within the same day; public transport, however, is limited outside the city. Burundi has made tentative progress towards peace and stability since a power-sharing government was set up in 2001 and most rebel groups agreed to disarm, but in 2015 President Nkurunziza’s bid to change the constitution and stand for a third term sparked mass protests and a violent response from the state. Hundreds of thousands of Burundians have fled into neighbouring Tanzania, fearing the collapse of the country’s fragile democracy and a return to civil war.

The Belgians took over after the war and continued what the Germans had started: namely a perverse programme of ethnic segregation. The minority Tutsi were given the highest positions in society, dominating the army, civil service and higher reaches of the economy, while the majority Hutu were largely discriminated against and excluded from positions of power. This segregation precipitated the 1994 genocide in neighbouring Rwanda, which was also ruled by Germany and Belgium, and has led to chronic instability in Burundi. The antagonism has occasionally flared up into mass violence and the massacre of tens of thousands, especially in 1972 and 1988. Multiparty elections for a National Assembly were held in 1993, which resulted in President Pierre Buyoya replaced by the Hutu banker Melchior Ndadaye, who was killed later that year in unsuccessful military coup. Things continued in that violent vein in 1994 when President Cyprien Ntaryamira, another Hutu, was killed with Rwandan president, Juvénal Habyarimana, when their plane was shot down over Kigali. The incident is widely seen as the trigger for the Rwandan Genocide in which some one million Rwandans died. Burundi narrowly avoided the same fate, although tensions between Tutsis and Hutus sharply increased, and the civil war that followed claimed 300,000 lives. Two years later, Buyoya took over once again in another coup. The guerrilla war between Hutu rebels and the Tutsi-dominated army intensified. However, mediation efforts by Tanzania and personal intervention by Nelson Mandela served to pacify things in 2000, with a final settlement in 2001. A transitional government, jointly led by Buyoya and FRODEBU leader Domitien Ndayizeye, held power until 2003, when Ndayizeye became the country's sole leader. In 2005, Pierre Nkurunziza was elected president, but his leaderships has failed to bring stability to the country – in fact Burundi witnessed extreme violence after the 2015 elections, which saw Nkurunziza win a controversial third term. Since then the country’s long-suffering citizens have endured hunger, disease and violence, pushing Burundi towards what the UN describes as a major crisis. Did you know? •	Burundi remained one of Africa’s few kingdoms until four years after independence. The last king was Ntare V. •	Its two national parks, Kibira and Ruvubu, were founded in 1982. •	The first Europeans to visit the area were the British explorers John Hanning Speke and Richard F Burton in 1858. 77% of the population are Christian, the majority of which are Roman Catholic; there are Anglican and Pentecostal minorities. 22% adhere to animist beliefs. There is also a small (1%) Muslim community. Normal social courtesies apply. However, outside the cities people may not be used to visitors, and care and tact must be used in respect of local customs. Inhabitants of major towns generally have a more modern way of life. Dress should be reasonably conservative. The official languages are French and Kirundi, a Bantu language. Swahili and English are also spoken.","A hot equatorial climate is found near Lake Tanganyika and in the Ruzizi River plain. It is often windy on the lake. The rest of the country is mild and pleasant. Burundi has two rainy seasons - the major one from February to May, with a minor rainy season between September and November, and two dry seasons: the long dry season from June to August and the shorter dry season between December and January. Lightweight cottons and linens with waterproofs for the rainy season. Warm clothes are recommended for the evening. Burundi is a land-locked country in the heart of Africa, a little south of the equator, on the eastern shore of Lake Tanganyika. It is bordered by Rwanda to the north, by the Democratic Republic of Congo to the west and by Tanzania to the south and east. The interior is a broken plateau sloping east to Tanzania and the valley of the River Malagarasi. The southern tributary of the Nile system rises in the south of the country. The landscape is characterised by hills and valleys covered with eucalyptus trees, banana groves, cultivated fields and pasture. In the east, the fertile area gives way to savannah grassland, and tea and coffee are now grown on mountainsides."
africa,cameroon,"While referring to Cameroon as “Africa in miniature” has become a bit of a cliché, this statement certainly rings true: everything you would expect from the African continent seems to be consolidated here, in this enticing and eclectic land. The beautiful south is characterised by tropical rainforests and deserted golden beaches, which would be chock full of bathers in a more developed destination. There’s a hearty appetite for independence in the English-speaking south, but, despite the best efforts of local pressure groups, it has yet to break free from the rest of the country. In contrast to the south, the dramatic landscapes of northern Cameroon are dominated by great expanses of desert, lakes and savannah. Traditional villages still cling on in this unforgiving land, which is perhaps the most culturally diverse region in Cameroon, home as it is to some 50 ethnic groups. Though largely peaceful, the region has been rocked by attacks from extremists in recent years. Keep abreast of the latest news. Pack your hiking gear if you’re heading to western Cameroon, which is dominated by volcanic mountains. Looking out across these rugged ranges you could be forgiven for thinking you were on Mars, such is their otherworldly appearance. It’s not all about the landscapes, though. Scattered across the country are a handful of game reserves, which offer ample opportunity to observe impressive wildlife, including elephants and lions. Cameroon really should be one of Africa’s leading destinations, but poverty blights much of its infrastructure, meaning transport and accommodation are chronically underdeveloped. Outstanding border disputes haven’t helped, either – travellers are advised to steer clear of the frontiers with Nigeria, Chad and the Central African Republic, which are considered unstable. Aside from certain no-go areas, Cameroon has much to offer adventurous travellers. From its verdant rainforests to its iconic wildlife, the country is bursting with life. Go and you shall be handsomely rewarded. 475,442 sq km (183,569 sq miles). 26.285.652 (UN estimate 2020). 49.9 per sq km. Yaoundé. Republic. President Paul Biya since 1982. Prime Minister Joseph Dion Ngute since 2019.","In the first century, the Sao people settled around Lake Chad and it is from them that much of the country's remarkable sculpture originates. Present-day Cameroon was at the heartland of an area that extended into Nigeria, under the control of the Duala people. An estimated 200 distinct ethnic groups live in the region, the largest of which is the Bamileke, a tribe occupying the west and centre of the country. Equatorial Bantu live in the area between the Congo basin and the plateaux of the interior, while small hunting bands of pygmies dwell in the remote southern forests. The Portuguese arrived in the 15th century; later, in the 1880s, the area became a German protectorate. But after Germany's defeat in World War 1, Cameroon was divided between Britain and France. French Cameroon achieved independence in 1957, under the control of the principal pro-independence party, the Union Nationale Camerounaise (UNC). In 1961, the northern provinces voted to become part of Nigeria, while the south opted for union with French Cameroon. A centralised political and administrative system was introduced with the veteran northern politician, Ahmadou Ahidjo, as President. In 1975, Paul Biya became Prime Minister and when Ahidjo stepped down in 1982, he was succeeded by Biya who as head of the UNC and its successor party, the Rassemblement Démocratique du Peuple Camerounais (RDPC), Biya has since achieved complete political domination over Cameroon. In recent years Cameroon's English-speaking territories have become increasingly isolated from Biya's government with some politicians from these regions calling for greater devolution, even secession. However, the country is generally quite stable in social and political terms, allowing the development of infrastructure and industry. Cameroon joined the Commonwealth in 1995 and the UN Security Council in 2002, as one of three African representatives (with Angola and Guinea). It is also a member of la Francophonie. Its record on human rights is considered flawed but has been generally improving. Did you know?  The two most popular types of music in Cameroon are makossa, a blend of highlife, soul, folk and Congo music; and bikutsi, the dance music of the Ewondo people heard of Paul Simon's 1990 album, The Rhythm of the Saints.  Although French and English are the official languages, Cameroon his home to some 1738 language groups.  in May 2014, following the Chibok schoolgirl kidnapping, Cameroon joined Chad in declaring war on the Boko Haram and deployed troops on the border with Nigeria. The majority of the population hold Christian (mainly Roman Catholic) or traditional animist beliefs. The sizeable remainder are followers of Islam. Handshaking is the customary form of greeting. In the north, where the population is largely Muslim, Islamic traditions should be respected. Visitors should never step inside a Muslim prayer circle of rocks. In other rural areas, where traditional beliefs predominate, it is essential to use tact.Photography: Cameras should be used with discretion, particularly in rural areas. Always ask permission before taking a photograph. Do not photograph airports, military establishments, official buildings, or military personnel in uniform. The official languages are French and English. They are given equal importance in the constitution, but French is the more commonly spoken. Pidgin English is widely spoken, particularly in coastal areas, and Spanish is spoken in some urban centres. More than 200 different African languages are also spoken in the country.","The south is hot and dry November-February. The main rainy season is June-October. Temperatures in the north vary. On the Adamaoua Plateau, temperatures drop sharply at night; the rainy season is May-October. Grassland areas inland are much cooler than the coast with regular rainfall. The best months to visit are January- April. Lightweight cotton clothes, canvas or light leather shoes or sandals. Waterproofs are advised for coastal areas. Situated on the west coast of Africa, Cameroon is bordered to the west by the Gulf of Guinea, to the northwest by Nigeria, to the northeast by Chad (with Lake Chad at its northern tip), to the east by the Central African Republic and to the south by Congo-Brazzaville (Republic of the Congo), Gabon and Equatorial Guinea. The far north of the country is a semi-desert broadening into the vast Maroua Plain, with game reserves and mineral deposits. This is bordered to the west by the lush Mandara Mountains; the Benue River rises here and flows westwards into the Niger. The country to the northwest is particularly striking: volcanic peaks covered by bamboo forest rise to over 2,000m (6,500ft), with waterfalls and villages scattered over the lower slopes. Further to the south and west are savannah uplands, while dense forest covers the east and south. The highest peak, at 4,095m (13,434ft) is Mount Cameroon, which lies close to the coast. The humid coastal strip is tropical, with a mixture of rainforest and farmland. The River Wouri, which flows southwest into the Gulf of Guinea, inspired the country's name after 15th-century Portuguese sailor Fernando Po's spoke of the Rio dos Cameroes (river of shrimps)."
africa,cape-verde,"The islands of Cape Verde are a bewitching blend of Portuguese and African influences. You'll see it in the many European-style buildings and the curious musical styles, but its particularly noticeable in the food. Portuguese fare – especially seafood dishes laden with garlic and olive oil – and more African-style fare – such as stews, beans, maize and tropical crops – comfortably combined on most menus. Many associate Cape Verde with the mournful songs of Cesaria Evoria, the islands' best known singer. The ‘barefoot diva' is the best exponent of morna, a lovelorn type of folk music similar to Portuguese fado. Music is a key component of life on Cape Verde, and several of the islands stage exuberant carnivals, with the best known being the Baia das Gatas Festival. São Vicente is also renowned for its exuberant festivities. Once a colony and slave trade outpost, Cape Verde varies wildly in character and scenery through its 10 islands and five tiny islets. From spectacular verdant mountain ranges, to deserted beaches, with a few volcanic landscapes thrown in for good measure, it's the variety that makes Cape Verde such an unusual and appealing destination. There’s lush and lively Santiago, the biggest of the islands, which boasts verdant hillsides, jungle and plenty of remarkable wildlife. It’s also the cultural heart of Cape Verde, home to the UNESCO-listed old fort at Cidade da Ribeira Grande de Santiagog (previously called Cidade Velha). Near Santiago, divers will discover 16th century shipwrecks littering the sea floor. Blue marlin, yellowfin tuna and the odd humpback whale can be seen in the clear blue waters off Boa Vista. The island of Sal is popular for watersports and white sandy beaches, while Fogo is a hiker’s paradise, where volcanic peaks tower 2,829m (9,821 ft) above sea-level. Cape Verde may have struggled economically since gaining independence from Portugal in 1975, but many argue that it's isolation is a blessing, leaving these islands comparatively unspoiled. The economy is currently stable and investing in modernized infrastructure, service, commerce, foreign investment and tourism. Get there before the crowds inevitably catch on. 4,033 sq km (1,557 sq miles). 558,071 (UN estimate 2019). 135.4 per sq km. Praia. Republic. President José Maria Neves since 2021. Prime Minister Ulisses Correia e Silva since 2021.","The Portuguese discovered and colonised the archipelago of 10 volcanic islands that now constitute Cape Verde in 1462. The settlement on São Tiago (Santiago) was the first European toehold in the tropics and was ideally located as a supply point for slaves traded to Brazil and the West Indies. The end of the slave trade in the 19th century marked the beginning of a lengthy period of economic decline. However, in time Cape Verde recovered and re-established itself as an important commercial center and stopover point for fleets shipping British coal to the Americas. In 1951, Cape Verde’s status was redefined from that of a Portuguese Guinea colony, to an overseas province. In the 1960s and early 1970s, the islands were used as a garrison by the Portuguese army, while many members of the growing independence movement fled to Guinea-Bissau, to form the Partido Africano de Independência do Guiné e Cabo Verde (PAIGC) under revolutionary leader Amilcar Cabral. Cape Verde achieved independence peacefully in 1975, following Portugal’s 1974 revolution shortly after the granting of independence to Guinea-Bissau, with whom Cape Verde had close political associations. The PAIGC took control of the political activities of both countries and full unification was discussed. This proposal was shelved after the 1980 coup in Guinea-Bissau, after which the Cape Verdean branch of PAIGC was renamed the Partido Africano da Independência de Cabo Verde (PAICV). At the turn of the 1990s, the Government held elections in February 1991. The Movimento para Democracia (MPD) won both the legislature and the race for the Presidency. The MPD held onto both Presidency and national assembly in 1995, but lost both to the PAICV in 2001, when José Maria Pereira Neves was named prime minister and Pedro Pires elected president by a mere 12 votes. Although lacking natural resources Cape Verde is considered one of the most developed and democratic countries in Africa with its economy largely focused on tourism and foreign investment. In 2013 the government decided the Portuguese designation ‘Cabo Verde’ would be used for all official purposes. Did you know? Pico de Fogo is the region’s largest active volcano and last erupted in 2014. The Tavares brothers, who formed the international hit-making group of that name in 1973, are of Cape Verdean descent. Their hits include It Only Takes a Minute and More Than A Woman. Although Portuguese is the official language of government, the native tongue is Cape Verdean Creole. 80% of Cape Verdeans practice Catholicism. Of the remaining, 10% are Protestant and the others belong to smaller religious denominations. The Catholic majority comes from Portuguese influence. The usual European social courtesies should be observed. The official language is Portuguese. Creole is spoken by most of the inhabitants. Some English, French, German and Spanish are widely spoken.","Cape Verde's subtropical climate makes year-round travel pleasant and worthwhile. The islands experience a windy season (Tempo de Brisas) from October to mid-July and a rainy season (Tempo das chuvas) that lasts from August to September. The islands receive sunshine year-round with the longest days from March to May. Windy season (October-July) average temperatures range between 25-29°C (77-84°F). This is the best time for surfing and other water sports in Cape Verde, and sea temperatures don't usually dip below 23°C (73°F). During rainy season (August-September), high temperatures can break 30°C (86°F) so rainfall can be a welcoming relief. Sea temperatures are warmest during this period at 27°C (81°F). The best time to visit Cape Verde is from February to June when the days are long and sunny. The temperature at this time averages around 23°C (73°F). Keep in mind that the windward islands of São Vicente, Santo Antão, São Nicolau, Santa Luzia, Sal and Boa Vista will be cooler than the leeward islands of Santiago, Maio, Fogo and Brava. Lightweight throughout the year, tropical for midsummer. Nights can get chilly, so packing a lightweight jacket might help. Walking shoes or boots are appropriate for hikes. Cape Verde is situated in the Atlantic Ocean, 620km (385 miles) off the West Coast of Africa and comprises 10 islands, 9 inhabited and one uninhabited, and five islets in two groups: Barlavento (Windwards) and Sotavento (Leewards). In the former group are the islands of São Vicente, Santo Antão, São Nicolau, Santa Luzia, Sal and Boa Vista, along with the smaller islands of Branco and Raso; the Sotavento group comprises the islands of Santiago, Maio, Fogo and Brava, along with the smaller islands of Rei and Rombo. Land varies from island to island, but most have mountain peaks; the highest being Pico do Fogo, an active volcano on Fogo. The islands in the east are generally known for flat beaches and desert land. Western islands are rockier, with steep cliffs. Much of the land in Cape Verde is infertile and lacks minerals, which forces the country to import the majority of its food and goods. Wind and water erosion also make agriculture less sustainable, though much of the workforce lies in it."
africa,central-african-republic,"One of the least visited countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, the Central African Republic ranks amongst the poorest nations on the planet and has struggled to find its feet since gaining independence from France in 1960. Suffice to say few tourists venture out this way. A country of contrasts, the Central African Republic is a place where the Sahara Desert meets tropical Africa, where the pastoral traditions of Africa’s tribespeople rub shoulders with the colonial architecture of imperial France. The French influence is particularly strong in the capital, Bangui, which retains its colonial aesthetic and is scattered with patisseries serving fresh baguettes and éclairs. Vibrant stalls around the central market provide cheap and tasty local cuisine, which ranges from fish straight out of the Ubangi River to fried plantain and fufu, a sour-tasting starch prepared from manioc flour which is a staple of the region. The country’s frenzied markets are perfect places to interact with and better understand the culturally diverse tribespeople that make up the population. The shortest interaction with these people shows them to be inquisitive, warm and generous beyond their means. Geographically, much of the Central African Republic is composed of rolling grasslands, dusty deserts and steamy jungles. The northern reaches of the country are dominated by the seemingly infinite Sahara. With so little light pollution here, the night skies gleams with millions of stars. The far south is home to equatorial rainforests, which are considered some of the best places in Africa to see forest elephants and western lowland gorillas. The jungle is also home to pygmy tribes, which live off the land in remote pockets of central Africa. Visits to these tribes are possible and offer an insight into their extraordinary lives. 622,984 sq km (240,535 sq miles). 4.829.767 (UN estimate 2020). 8.7 per sq km. Bangui. Republic. President Faustin-Archange Touadéra since 2016. Prime Minister Félix Moloua since 2022.","The territory we now know as the Central African Republic has been settled since at least the 7th century and incorporated into a number of regional empires including the Kanem and Wadai empires. In the 16th and 17th centuries, prior to French colonisation of central Africa in the 1880s, many tribes fled to the region in order to escape the slave trade. In 1910, the area, then known as Ubangi-Chari, became incorporated into French Equatorial Africa, however, after WWII, the territory was granted its own assembly, as well as representation in the French National Assembly. Internal self-government followed in 1958, with the leading nationalist politician, Barthélemy Boganda, serving as prime minister. Boganda died the following year and his nephew, David Dacko, took the country to full independence in 1960. In 1965, with the country facing bankruptcy and political chaos, Dacko was overthrown by army chief Jean-Bedel Bokassa, and the already impoverished country was further damaged by the disastrous and profligate rule of the self-styled emperor. The 1977 'coronation' of Emperor Bokassa I is estimated to have used up over a quarter of the country's annual income. The regalia alone is estimated at the time to have cost US$5m. Under his rule, the Central African Republic was renamed the Central African Empire. Bokassa was deposed just two years later by Dacko and exiled to France, with the country reverting to its previous name, Central African Republic. The two dominant figures in the country’s more recent history have been André Kolingba, another former army commander, who took charge after ousting Dacko in a 1981 military coup, and Ange-Félix Patassé, who later emerged as Kolingba's principal opponent. Following a transitional period, which led to presidential and parliamentary elections in 2005, François Bozizé was elected as president in place of Patassé and was subsequently elected for a second term, beating Patassé to the leadership once again. In 2016 Faustin Archange Touadéra was inaugurated as president.

africa,chad,"From the natural wonders of the Sahara Desert and Lake Chad to the tribal culture and hospitality that flourishes across the country, Chad quietly gets on with creating unforgettable experiences, while the rest of the world looks on unaware. With a predominantly rural population, urban life is restricted to N’Djamena, the capital. As Chad’s commercial hub it attracts people from over 200 different ethnic groups. The result is a diverse set of social structures rubbing alongside one another and stark contrasts between the capital’s modernist heart and the ancient ways of nomadic tribespeople such as the Tuareg and Toubou. Ethnicity remains far more important than Chadian identity and tribes hold dear a rich cultural heritage that remains largely unchanged by time or the outside world. Chad’s prehistoric cave paintings, found amid gnarled rock formations in the Sahara Desert, document the existence of large animals in the region for millennia, so it is therefore unsurprising that even today the country is home to some of Africa’s most iconic species, including elephant, rhino, giraffe, leopard and lion. Birdsong, made all the sweeter by the desert landscape, is near constant in the hidden palm-fringed oases of the Sahara, while the clear blue waters of Lake Chad form the second largest wetland in Africa and an important source of water for not only birds but reptiles and larger mammals too. Whether it is to experience the solitude of the Sahara, seek out the hospitality of the Tuareg or witness animals surviving in the one of the most extreme landscapes on Earth, Chad offers hardy travellers an extraordinary experience. It may be nicknamed the “dead heart of Africa,” but as anyone who knows this country will tell you, that moniker couldn’t be further from the truth. 1,284,000 sq km (495,800 sq miles). 14,496,739 (UN estimate 2016). 9.1 per sq km.

Prime Minister Succès Masra since January 2024.","Indications of settlements around Lake Chad date back to Neolithic times, and the lake’s shores have acted as an important junction for several major trans-Saharan caravan routes for centuries. From the 11th to the 15th century, the state of Kanem was the dominant force in the region, occupying much of the area that makes up present-day Chad. In the 15th and 16th centuries, the state of Borno, which had its centre on the other side of Lake Chad (in present-day Nigeria), exercised a major influence. A gradual process of Islamisation took place across the region from this time, especially during the 16th and 17th centuries, which saw the kingdoms of the Bagirmi and Ouaddai reach their zenith. The slave trade was a key component of their economies, and as this declined from the early 19th century onwards, so did the kingdoms. In the 1880s, Bagirmi and Ouaddai were conquered by the Sudanese warlord Rabih al-Zubair. Europeans arrived a few decades later, with Chad first defined as a national territory in 1910, as one of the four nations making up French Equatorial Africa. Chad achieved independence in 1960, with François Tombalbaye, leader of the Parti Progressiste Tchadien (PPT), as prime minister. The country’s post-independence history has been characterised by political instability and tensions, largely due to religious and cultural divisions between the Muslim north and Christian/animist south. It is a pattern also found in other African countries, including Nigeria and Sudan. The discovery of large oil deposits in the southern Doba region of the country has provided the government with an opportunity to develop the economy. It has also heightened interest in Chad, a relative international backwater, and has led to some improvement to previously rocky relations with France, the USA, and international institutions such as the World Bank. Did you know? •	In villages, it is a popular belief that taking the dirt from the corner of a dog's eye and putting it in your own will help you see demons. •	A future husband must work in his future father-in-law’s fields for three years. •	Chad is sometimes known as “the Babel tower of the world” because of the number of languages spoken. 50% Muslim, 35% Christian, 15% animist and other. Chadians are a relaxed and friendly people, but respect for traditional beliefs and customs is expected. Dress is informal, but conservative in respect of Muslim laws. There is strict segregation of women in the Muslim areas. It is customary to shake hands. The left hand should never be used for offering or accepting food, nor should the sole of the foot be exposed in the presence of a Muslim. Identification should be carried at all times; failure to do so may result in detention by police.Photography: It is necessary to obtain a permit from the Ministry of Information in order to take photographs.

africa,comoros,"Not your typical tropical island getaway, Comoros may lay claim to sandy shores, limpid oceans and colourful coral reefs, but the archipelago’s greatest asset is its fascinating culture, which fuses together the most colourful elements of Africa and Arabia. Floating between Mozambique and Madagascar, the archipelago has long been a crossroads between civilisations and most Comorians are of mixed Afro-Arab descent. A blend of Swahili and traditional Islamic influences pervade the islands giving them a calm and phlegmatic atmosphere that guarantees a hospitable welcome. The four main islands that comprise sleepy Comoros do not share the tourist infrastructure of the Seychelles or Mauritius (with the exception of Mayotte), but they do share the warm seas, deserted beaches and stunning hiking that these destinations are renowned for. Most travellers enter the country via the capital, Moroni, which nestles on the island of Grande Comore and hums with the atmosphere and traditional customs of a long-forgotten outpost. Men drink tea beneath whitewashed buildings in the Arab Quarter, as they have done for decades, while women in brightly coloured East African fabrics smile shyly from ornate doorways. Also known as the Perfume Islands, the smell of vanilla, cloves and other spices is ever-present in Comoros, and locals are proud to produce more Ylang-Ylang essence for the perfume industry than anywhere else. Leave fragrant Moroni behind and trek to the summit of Mount Karthala, also on Grande Comore. The archipelago’s highest peak, at just under 2,400m (7,800ft), this lofty vantage point happens to be one of the region’s most active volcanoes. The views are exquisite. For a taste of France pay a visit to Mayotte, which, due to a quirk in colonial history is now governed from Paris. Arguably the most developed of the islands, it has a distinctly Gallic air, adding more depth to these already characterful islands. 2,235 sq km (863 sq miles). 807,118 (UN estimate 2016). 349.4 per sq km.

The islands were ceded to the French in 1841, and became a French protectorate in 1886, before being formally adopted as colonial possessions in 1912. The Comoros were then governed as part of Madagascar until 1947, when they became a separate French Overseas Territory. Internal self-government was granted in 1961, although full independence was not achieved until 1975. The main reason was the position of Mayotte, one of the original Comoros island group, which insisted upon retaining its links with France. With Mayotte going its own way, the Comoros joined the United Nations as the Federal Islamic Republic of the Comoros, comprising three islands: Grande Comore, Anjouan and Moheli. Ahmed Abdallah was elected as the first president, but within months Abdallah was overthrown. However, in 1978, with the assistance of French mercenaries, Abdallah regained his position, though his success was short-lived – he was assassinated the following year. A confusing series of coups and counter coups ensued for the next decade or so, many led by Bob Denard, a French soldier and mercenary. Although Denard's last attempt was suppressed by French troops despatched from Reunion, he had previously overthrown presidents with the open support of the French government. Elections successfully took place in 1996, and the new government of Abdoulkarim Taki was determined to introduce Islamic law to the islands. This was fiercely resisted in many quarters. President Taki died in 1998, and was replaced by Ben Said Massounde. The new government was overthrown in a military coup led by Colonel Azali Assoumani in 1999, which was the country’s 18th coup. During the next two years, the military government laid plans for a new constitution that would maintain the group as a single country, but with much greater autonomy afforded to the individual islands. In 2001, it was approved in a national referendum. The following year Assoumani was declared president of the newly entitled Union of Comoros. The handover of power to his successor in 2006 was the first peaceful change of leadership in the country’s history. Did you know? •	Since independence the Comoros Islands have averaged a coup every 22 months, giving it the nickname ‘cloud coup coup land’. •	The Comoros are considered one of only two electoral democracies in the Arab world. •	Geographically and historically part of the Comoros, the island of Mayotte voted to remain part of France. It is one of the European Union’s outermost regions. Muslim (mostly Sunni) with Roman Catholic minority. Religious customs associated with Islam should be respected. Although Comorans are tolerant towards other cultures (for instance, alcohol is not banned and is available in hotels and restaurants), they expect moderate behaviour from non Muslim visitors, such as no consumption of alcohol in public places and modest dress in public. The official languages are French, Arabic and Comorian, a blend of Arabic and Swahili.","The climate is tropical and very warm. Coastal areas are hot and very humid, interspaced with rains and seasonal cyclones (January to April). The upland areas are cooler, particularly at night, and have higher rainfall. The rainy season is from November to April. Lightweight cottons and linens with waterproofing during the rainyseason. Warmer garments and rainwear are needed for the mountains. The Comoro archipelago is situated in the Indian Ocean, north of Madagascar. It consists of four main islands of volcanic origin, which are surrounded by coral reefs: Ngazidja (formerly Grande Comore), Nzwani (formerly Anjouan), Mwali (formerly Mohéli) and Mahoré (Mayotte). The latter is administered by France, but is claimed by the Federal Islamic Republic of the Comoros. Land can only support subsistence agriculture, but the surrounding seas are rich in marine life."
africa,democratic-republic-of-congo,"The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) is one of the largest and most enigmatic countries in Africa. It has many beautiful landscapes, mainly comprising dense and undulating rainforest interspersed with waterfalls and teeming with fascinating wildlife. The great body of the Congo River runs across the northern reaches of the country and has long been a site of considerable historic importance, made famous by the explorer Henry Morton Stanley and later used as the backdrop for Joseph Conrad’s Heart of Darkness. In many ways, much of the DRC remains as wild and impenetrable today as it would have been in Conrad’s time. The transport infrastructure built by the brutal Belgian colonial regime has largely been reclaimed by the jungle and there are few links between the country’s vast interior and the urban areas dotted around its fringes. Kinshasa, the capital, is situated in the far west of the country and, though largely impoverished and crumbling, it is a veritable hub for colourful African music and culture. DRC’s tourist capital, if such a thing exists, is Goma, which sits on the banks of Lake Kivu in the far east of the country. It is presided over by the imposing Nyiragongo volcano, which sits at the heart of Virunga National Park, the oldest national park in Africa and one of just a handful of places where you can still see mountain gorillas in their natural habitat. Goma and the mineral-rich Kivu region were hit particularly hard by a civil war from 1998 to 2003 that resulted in the deaths of at least three million people; sporadic bouts of violence since the war officially ended have continued to burden the region’s considerable tourist potential. However, peace and a semblance of stability have returned to Goma for the time being and small handfuls of adventurous tourists are beginning to trickle across the border once again.

President Félix Tshisekedi since 2019. Prime Minister Judith Suminwa Tuluka since 2024.","The Belgian Congo was created in 1885, essentially as the personal property of the Belgian monarch, King Leopold II. He provided only the minimum infrastructure necessary to support the extraction of the country's vast mineral wealth and killed an estimated 10 million Congolese, setting a pattern which has dominated this troubled country ever since. By the end of WWII, the Belgian Congo had become one of the many African colonies whose occupiers were concerned simply to dispose of with minimum fuss and maximum commercial advantage. The Belgian Congo was duly granted independence, with little preparation, in 1960. With the support of the Americans and Belgians – and through the exploitation of the country's myriad factional, tribal and regional disputes – the new government, headed by the visionary Patrice Lumumba, was deposed after just six months in an army coup led by Colonel Joseph Mobutu. Lumumba was executed. Four years later, Mobutu took over as head of state and established the regime, which ruled Zaire, as the country was renamed, for the next three decades. In the 30 years up to his demise, Mobutu Sese Seko (his adopted title) reduced the country to the point where it barely functioned as a nation state. The military campaign that finally brought down the Mobutu regime was triggered by the genocide in neighbouring Rwanda. The genocide had been brought to an end by the intervention of the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF), a Tutsi-led force based in Uganda. The Hutu genocide perpetrators had mostly fled into north eastern Zaire. The RPF pursued them, but their incursion took on a different aspect and a momentum of its own as other groups, including many long-term exiled opponents of Mobutu, coalesced around the RPF. Laurent Kabila was adopted as leader of this newly-formed anti-Mobutu coalition. By the autumn of 1996, the Alliance des Forces Démocratiques pour la Liberation du Congo-Zaire (AFDL) had completed their takeover. Once in power, however, Kabila proved incapable of ruling the country, which was renamed the Democratic Republic of Congo. Years of bloody civil war followed and culminated in the assassination of Kabila by one of his bodyguards in 2001. He was succeeded by his son Joseph, who won disputed UN-guided general elections in 2006 and 2011. During Joseph Kabila’s tenure, episodes of extreme rebel-led violence have continued to erupt sporadically in various regions, while Kabila’s own human rights record has grown increasingly dubious.

africa,djibouti,"Tucked away in the Horn of Africa, diminutive Djibouti offers ethereal landscapes, traditional tribes and mega marine life by the camel load – little wonder this slice of East Africa is being touted as the next big thing. Refreshingly devoid of large-scale tourist developments (for now, at least), you won’t find international hotel chains outside the eponymous colonial capital. Tourists are still something of a rarity and it is not uncommon to be invited into a family’s home to share a pot of tea. Contrasting strongly with the bright blue skies and the colourful macawis worn by locals, the flat plains outside Djibouti City have a harsh and otherworldly aesthetic, which are celebrated by the local tribespeople in poetry and song. The loose rocks that litter the khaki-coloured ground amid semi-wild herds of camel speak of the country’s volcanic past. Away from the capital, which is wafted by a cool Red Sea breeze, Djibouti becomes oppressively hot in the summer months. Locals move slowly and purposefully; at least until the daily delivery of khat, a semi-narcotic plant chewed like gum, which seems to stop daily life in its tracks. If you do manage to defy the heat, there are ample opportunities to connect with the natural world. Visitors can scale the dormant Ardoukoba volcano, explore Lake Assal, the lowest point in Africa, or go snorkelling with whale sharks in the Red Sea. Found in the Bay of Ghoubbet, these slow-moving giants trawl the Djiboutian coast, gorging on plankton. Exhibiting a blend of African and Arabian culture, the people of Djibouti are equally fascinating. Gracious and welcoming to foreigners, their country still largely works along tribal lines, but it is quiet, unthreatening and small enough to get to grips with. Above all else, though, it’s absolutely stunning. 23,200 sq km (8,958 sq miles). 899,598 (UN estimate 2016). 35.7 per sq km. Djibouti. Republic. President Ismail Omar Guelleh since 1999. Prime Minister Abdoulkader Kamil Mohamed since 2013.","Inhabited at least since the Neolithic age, Djibouti is one of the cradles of human civilisation and is a likely contender to have been part of the region known to the Ancient Egyptians as Punt as long ago as 2500BC. Somali and Afar ethnic groups in the area were early adopters of Islam and for much of the medieval period the land we now know as Djibouti changed hands between a variety of Muslim sultanates and the more powerful Ethiopian emperors. Once the French established a permanent administration in the city of Djibouti in the early 1890s they created French Somaliland in the surrounding region, affording it 'overseas territory' status in 1945. That lasted until 1967 when it was blessed with the catchy moniker, the French Territory of the Afars and the Issas (TFAI). Tensions between the Afars, the Issas and the French led to sporadic outbreaks of violence during the late 1960s and early 1970s until in 1977, the French agreed to withdraw and the country achieved independence with Hassan Gouled Aptidon as president. A sizeable French military presence in the country guaranteed the Gouled regime, which was threatened by organised opposition – both inside the country and abroad – and by the instability of its larger neighbours, Somalia and Ethiopia and, later on, Eritrea. In 1991, Afar tribesmen launched a major assault on the regime, under the rubric of Le Front pour la Restauration de l'Unité et la Démocratie (FRUD). After two years of fighting, the rebellion was quashed with French support and, in May 1993, Gouled was re-elected as president. After a major split within FRUD, part of the movement formed an alliance with the government and the ruling Rassemblement Populaire pour le Progrès (RPP). Gouled resigned in the spring of 1999 after 22 years in office. Gouled's nephew and former security chief, Ismail Omar Guelleh, replaced him and comfortably won the April 1999 poll. Apart from a failed coup in December 2000 – orchestrated by a disaffected former police chief – Djibouti has since enjoyed a welcome spell of domestic calm. In April 2005, Guelleh won a second-term in a one-man presidential election, a feat he repeated in 2011 and 2016 with 80 per cent and 86 per cent of the respective votes cast. Did you know? • An incredible 88 per cent Djibouti's largest forest, the Day Forest, has been lost in the last 200 years – more than 20 per cent in the last 50 years. • Somali love songs in the Balwo style are popular in Djibouti. • The Djibouti francolin bird is critically endangered and is only known in two locations. Predominantly Muslim (94%) with Roman Catholic, Protestant and Greek Orthodox minorities. Casual wear is widely acceptable, but visitors are reminded that Djibouti is a Muslim country and certain codes of behaviour should be observed. The official languages are Arabic and French.

English is spoken by hoteliers, taxi drivers and traders.","Extremely hot and particularly arid between June and August when the dusty Khamsin blows from the desert. Between October and April it is slightly cooler with occasional light rain; however, there is generally less than 150mm (6in) of rainfall annually. Djibouti is part of the African continent, bordered to the northeast and east by the Red Sea, the southeast by Somalia, the southwest by Ethiopia and to the north by Eritrea. The country is a barren strip of land around the Gulf of Tadjoura, varying in width from 20km (12 miles) to 90km (56 miles), with a coastline of 300km (188 miles), much of it white sandy beaches. Inland is semi-desert and desert, with thorn bushes, steppes and volcanic mountain ranges."
africa,egypt,"A complicated but fascinating country with some of the most enduring historical monuments on Earth, Egypt stands as an unforgettable travel destination. It’s had to deal with its fair share of turmoil in recent times, but this North African nation remains proud, welcoming and accessible. And with treasures as timeless as the temples and pyramids of the Nile to shout about, it’s not somewhere that’s going to slip from public consciousness any time soon. A trip here still very much has the potential to thrill. In many ways, there are two Egypts. The first is the Egypt of Cairo and the Nile, of bustling medieval bazaars, noseless Sphinxes, river cruises and Agatha Christie-era exoticism. The second, and just as integral to many visitors, is the Egypt of the Red Sea, where a spread of large-scale modern resorts caters to sun-seekers and scuba divers. Sharm el Sheikh, with its world-class diving, high-end hotels and desert adventures, is the best known of them. Most of the country’s ancient treasures were built during the time of the pharaohs. The Pyramids of Giza (the sole survivors of the Seven Ancient Wonders of the World); the lotus-columned temples of Luxor and Karnak; the Valley of the Kings; Aswan and the temples of Abu Simbel: strung along the Nile, these monuments have drawn visitors for centuries. They represent a lasting legacy of one of the most fabled periods of human history. Of course, the country is best understood not so much for its great monuments or its coral reefs, splendid though they are, but through its people. Bartering for a bargain in Cairo’s ancient Khan al-Khalili bazaar, taking tea and falling into long conversation with a local, or simply stopping awhile in a remote village, silent but for the chatter of hooves on tarmac, will give a glimpse of a country full of character, colour and fortitude. 1,001,450 sq km (386,662 sq miles). 94,137,816 (UN estimate 2016). 88.4 per sq km. Cairo (El Qahira). Republic. President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi since 2014. Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouli since June 2018.","Egypt’s history is one of the oldest and most evocative of any country in the world. Who can fail to be captivated by the lives of pharaohs like Tutankhamun who ruled for just ten years but is, arguably, the most famous of all the ancient Egyptian kings? Or Cleopatra, Egypt’s last pharaoh? Egypt can trace its history back to around 8000 BC when drier conditions forced early civilisations in need of food and water closer to the Nile. However, Pharaonic Egypt began some 5,000 years ago and comprised kings from 30 different dynasties whose phenomenal knowledge of mathematics, biology and astronomy made the country one of the most powerful kingdoms the world. Their legendary wealth enabled them to build monumental structures like the Karnak Temple in Luxor, and the Pyramids of Giza. Pharaonic rule is divided into kingdoms. The Old Kingdom saw the building of the Gizan pyramids, the Middle Kingdom saw Egypt’s capital at Thebes, present-day Luxor, while the New Kingdom began around 1500 BC and gave us some of the greatest pharaohs in Egypt’s history. Later, Egypt saw the arrival of Alexander the Great, who founded Alexandria, and then the Roman Empire. The arrival of Napoleon in AD 1798 brought Egypt once more into violent contact with a European power. By 1805, however, the struggle for autonomy had been won, with Muhammad Ali being recognised as the first Sultan of Egypt. The completion of the Suez Canal in 1869, built in conjunction with France, brought popular discontent, since heavy taxation was required to pay for it, and eventually resulted in more than 70 years of British rule. Demands for the canal’s nationalisation and the country’s independence continued until revolution in 1952. 2011 saw the country again engulfed in widespread protests against the government, which resulted in long-standing President Hosni Mubarak’s resignation, and the eventual return of the military to power. The downing of a Russian passenger jet over the Sinai Peninsula in 2015 – an act of terror claimed by Islamic State militants – severely affected Egypt’s tourism industry. Elections in the same year brought stability to Egyptian politics, but the country has been criticised internationally for its suppression of the media and lax airport security. Did you know? •	Ancient Egyptians worshipped over 1,400 different gods and goddesses. •	The young Egyptian citizen, Facebook Jamal Ibrahim, was named after the social media site to honour its role in fermenting the 2011 revolution. •	The Pyramids of Giza are the oldest of the Seven Ancient Wonders of the World, and the only one to still exist. About 90% of the population are Muslim, with the majority of the remainder being Christian, including followers of the Coptic Christian faith. There is also a small Jewish population. Islam is part of all aspects of daily life with many social conventions stemming from the teachings of the Koran, the Muslim holy book. Hospitality is a significant element, especially to visitors. Shaking hands is the normal greeting but male visitors should wait for a woman to offer her hand first. Dress should always be conservative and women should cover upper arms and legs. This is particularly important when visiting religious buildings - when hair should also be covered - and conservative towns. Dress standards tends to be a little more relaxed in modern nightclubs, restaurants, hotels and bars in Cairo, Alexandria and other tourist resorts. Official or social functions and smart restaurants usually require more formal wear. Smoking is widespread. Photography: Tourists are required to pay a fee if wishing to take photographs inside pyramids, tombs and museums. Ask permission when taking pictures of someone, especially women. Some traditionally-dressed locals demand money when they ‘pose’ outside historic sites, especially temples and pyramids. Arabic is the official language. English and French are widely spoken.","Egypt is a huge country with plenty of variety in its climate; when it’s chilly and wet in Alexandria, it can be ravishingly hot in Aswan. The best time to visit most sights, including the pyramids and the Valley of the Kings, or diving in the Red Sea, is from February to April and October to November. During these months the heat reminds you that it's the ‘Land of the Sun', but not too hot to be enjoyable. At this time, the skies and sea are a perfect blue. The downside is that these are the most popular times of the year for visitors. In April, the hot, dusty khamsin wind blows from the Sahara, making touring of sights potentially troublesome; during an intense sand storm, vision may be reduced to a few metres. During the hot, dry summers (June-August) there’s always the risk of dehydration and heat exhaustion, which might confine visitors indoors during the early afternoon. Winters (November-February) are usually mild and often overcast, leaving the desert and its ancient monuments looking lacklustre. Rainfall is negligible except on the coast. Loose, lightweight, modest cottons and linens, with warmer clothes for winter and cooler evenings, are culturally and climatically suitable. Traditional home of the roaming Bedouin, most of Egypt's landmass is comprised of flat, mostly featureless desert, supportive of minimal vegetation. The Mediterranean Sea forms Egypt's northern border, bringing cooler weather to the seaboard city of Alexandria and providing a coastal getaway for Cairo's residents. To the east, lies the mountainous Sinai Peninsula, which borders Israel and the Palestinian Territories; to the south, the deserts of Egypt quietly roll into the deserts of Sudan; to the west, the Great Western Desert forms an almost seamless wilderness through Libya and beyond. Sinai is divided from the main landmass of Africa by the country's busy shipping lane, the Suez Canal. For centuries, however, it was the River Nile, plied by felucca (traditional Nile sailing boats), that provided the main conduit for trade along the country's length. Railways and roads now compete for that distinction, but the Nile remains an important economic and cultural artery. The Nile perfuses the Delta north of Cairo, supporting 90% of the population in a flood land of cotton and rice-growing crops. The river's potency has been reduced since the building of the Aswan Dam; on the positive side, the dam has provided the country with a safe and reliable electricity supply - and has had the side effect of keeping the crocodiles out."
africa,equatorial-guinea,"Perhaps best known as the inspiration for Frederick Forsyth’s coup-laden thriller The Dogs of War, the political situation of hot and humid Equatorial Guinea leaves a lot to be desired. Corruption, human rights abuses and political violence are frequently recorded, and despite huge oil wealth little has trickled down to the people, where real poverty still exists. This means the country, which occupies a slice of mainland Africa and five offshore islands, is not set up with tourism in mind. Travel can be hard and hotel rooms both limited in number and expensive compared to neighbouring states. However, Equatorial Guinea offers a rare opportunity to experience central Africa’s colonial history and unspoiled natural beauty. Large areas of Rio Muni, mainland Equatorial Guinea, have been set aside as protected zones. Noted internationally for their biodiversity and hiking opportunities, the country’s rainforests are the habitat of various endangered primates including mandrills, chimpanzees and gorillas, as well as forest elephants. The capital, Malabo, lacks the frenetic energy of some cities on the continent, with nothing happening very fast. Its tranquillity and the laidback air of its people perhaps results from lying on the steamy island of Bioko. It’s atmospheric sides streets are the best place in the country to encounter the architectural splendours left by Spain’s colonial regime. Outside the capital, Bioko Island is also the location of the crater lakes of Lago Lorento and Lago Biao. Idyllic spots for relaxation, even the least interested birdwatcher will suddenly become the most ardent ornithologist: the sheer diversity of avian wildlife is staggering. Its natural wonders and hospitable inhabitants should have put Equatorial Guinea on the map years ago, but a reputation for political instability means this remains an untapped mine for now. 28,051 sq km (10,831 sq miles). 869,587 (UN estimate 2016). 26.4 per sq km. Malabo. Republic. President Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo since 1979. Prime Minister Manuela Roka Botey since 2023.","The paradox of plenty – Equatorial Guinea is Africa’s wealthiest nation on account of its huge revenues from oil, yet most of its population live in poverty. The region was colonised by the Portuguese in the late 15th century then ceded to Spain in 1788 and, despite interventions by the British and the French in the mid-19th century, the united island of Bioko and the Rio Muni continental mass were ran as the protectorate of Spanish Guinea until 1959 when it was granted self-rule. In October 1968 Spain bowed to UN pressure and conceded full independence. The first decade was blighted by the brutal misrule of President Macias Nguema. Backed to varying degrees by the USSR, China and Cuba, his regime presided over the alleged genocide of the minority Bubi people, the execution of thousands of political opponents, the closure of churches and the country’s economic collapse as skilled workers and foreigners fled. Macias Nguema was tried and executed in 1979 after being overthrown in a bloody coup led by his nephew, Lt Col Teodoro Obiang. Equatorial Guinea gained international recognition and joined the CFA Franc Zone, but relations with Spain remained touchy as its aid was dependent on democratisation. Throughout the 1980s, Obiang resisted the establishment of a multi-party system and even though a democratic constitution was declared in 1991 and the first multi-party legislative elections were held in late 1993, the government’s conduct of the election was such that the main opposition boycotted the poll. Consequently, the Obiang-controlled Partido Democratico Guinea Ecuatorial (PDGE) won a substantial majority of seats. This pattern of malpractice has continued more or less unabated at every subsequent election as the Obiang regime routinely identifies real or perceived coup attempts. Before the discovery of huge oil deposits in the Gulf of Guinea in the mid-1990s, Equatorial Guinea attracted little international attention. This has changed and although corruption watchdog Transparency International ranks Equatorial Guinea as one of the world’s 12 most-corrupt states, the regime remains an ally of the USA. Did you know? •	Equatorial Guinea is the only African state in which Spanish is an official language. •	In 2014 President Obiang’s son Toedorin was ordered to surrender US assets worth more than $30 million bought with stolen money. •	Mark Thatcher, son of Margaret Thatcher, the former British prime minister, was named as a financial backer of an alleged coup attempt in 2004. No official religion, but around 90% are Roman Catholic, with an animist minority.

Equatorial Guinea is bordered to the south and east by Gabon, to the north by Cameroon and to the west by the Gulf of Guinea. The country also comprises the island of Bioko, formerly Fernando Po, 34km (21 miles) off the coast of Cameroon, and the small offshore islands of Corisco, Great Elobey, Small Elobey and Annobón (formerly Pagalu). The mainland province, Rió Muni, is mainly forest, with plantations on the coastal plain and some mountains. Bioko rises steeply to two main peaks in the north and south. The southern area is rugged and inaccessible. Cultivation and settlements exist on the other slopes; above the farming land, the forest is thick. The beaches around the islands are extremely beautiful."
africa,eritrea,"Eritrea is a difficult country to define. Although in Africa, it doesn’t feel wholly African. While its broad shore faces the Middle East, it is not overtly Arabian. And though its capital evokes the spirit of Europe, it is far from European. For such a small country, Eritrea offers an astonishing variety and it tends to attract a motley crew of visitors: from archaeologists to architects; scholars to scuba divers; historians to hikers; and cyclists to steam railway buffs. While there are many reasons to come to Eritrea, there is one impression that endures when you leave: the remarkable kindliness of the Eritrean people. Making friends here is an unavoidable pleasure and one that touches the lives of so many visitors. The country stretches along the Red Sea and is low-lying in the eastern coastal regions and western border with Sudan, with a precipitous mountainous interior rising to a majestic 2,500m (8200ft) above sea level. Having been colonised in part by the Turks and Egyptians, Eritrea took on a European flavor with the arrival of the Italians in 1885 during their belated entry in the “scramble for Africa”. The legacies of successive foreign forces, combined with a rich mix of nine local ethnic groups have created a diverse cultural landscape that offers the best of African, Middle Eastern and European influences. Eritrea also boasts an abundance of historical and natural attractions. The colonial and modernist architecture of its towns and cities is as stunning and startling as the wildlife that populates its mountainous escarpments, deserts and coastline. Elephants, lions, baboons, gazelles, leopards, ostriches, turtles, dugongs and some of the continent’s rarest birds can all be found here. And with a coastline extending nearly 1,000km (621miles) along the Red Sea, Eritrea offers some of the best diving and snorkelling in the world, as well as the most secluded beaches. Once you’ve experienced Eritrea’s many secrets – travelled across its mountains and deserts, swam off its coastline, and met its warm people – it will only be a matter of time until you return for more. 117,600 sq km (45,405 sq miles). 5,401,231 (UN estimate 2016). 55.5 per sq km. Asmara. Republic. President Isaias Afewerki since 1993. President Isaias Afewerki since 1993.","Eritrea has for thousands of years been home to people of diverse living patterns, religions and traditions. After the South Arabian immigrations in the first millennium BC, Eritrea and much of Tigray were known as the Kingdom of the Habeshat. From the third to the seventh centuries AD, much of the present day territory lay within the Axumite Kingdom.  The Italians took the port of Massawa in 1885. They were relative latecomers in the so-called 'Scramble for Africa', but this was the beginning of an ambitious imperial campaign that sought to create a new Roman Empire in Africa. By 1900 they moved their capital from the steaming coastal lowlands to the salubrious climate enjoyed by the highland settlement of Asmara. The principal aims were to develop the colony with Italian immigrants, to exploit the natural resources and to equip it as a base for further expansion, which they later achieved in Libya, Somalia and Ethiopia. In the early 20th century, Eritrea became one of the six provinces of Italian East Africa and the capital, Asmara, was the jewel in their imperial crown – a truly modern city with stunning architecture, spacious planning and the most advanced infrastructure, including more traffic lights than Rome. However, Italy's African dream was short lived and in 1941 the British expelled them from Eritrea and administered the territory as a protectorate for a decade. In 1952 the UN decided that Eritrea should become part of a federated Ethiopia, but this arrangement only lasted a decade. Ethiopia's annexation of Eritrea in 1962 sparked a war for independence that lasted until 1991 and ended with Eritrean victory. In the subsequent referendum 99.8 per cent voted in favour of independence. However, hostilities between Ethiopia and Eritrea persisted and the two countries went to war again from 1998 to 2000, with Eritrean forces also fighting skirmishes with forces from Yemen and Djibouti. The war ended and a UN peacekeeping Mission in Eritrea and Ethiopia was installed. In 2002 the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague agreed upon a ""final and binding"" verdict that awarded the contested territory to Eritrea. Ethiopia rejected the verdict and the border issue remains unresolved with the consequent 'no war, no peace' scenario that has devastated so many lives throughout the region. Did you know? • Eritrea, with parts of Djibouti, Ethiopia, Northern Somalia and Sudan is the likely location of the land known to the Ancient Egyptians as Punt. • There are thought to be around 100 African bush elephants left in Eritrea, but between 1951 and 2001 there were no reported sightings at all. • As in Ethiopia the ritualised coffee ceremony is a key part of Eritrean culture. Eritrea's religious community is divided in two almost equal portions of Orthodox Christians and Muslims. There are some Catholics, Protestants and Jews in the highlands, especially in Asmara, and some animists in the western lowland regions. Shaking hands is the normal form of greeting, though you will also see locals performing the shoulder greeting. This looks like two people engaging in a mild scuffle as they press their shoulders together three times as a symbol of friendship, especially among ex-fighters. As with shaking hands, this greeting may take some time, so do not be disconcerted by this. Casual tourist wear is suitable for most places, but visitors should dress modestly. For business, a suit is most appropriate, though ties are not necessary, unless for very formal occasions. Coffee is a delicacy in Eritrea and to be asked to take coffee is a symbol of hospitality and the way that Eritreans honour their guests. It takes up to an hour for the coffee to be prepared in a coffee ceremony and it is standard practice that you must have three cups and compliment the taste before leaving. Smoking is not popular with traditional or elderly Eritreans. Shoes should be taken off in churches and, particularly, in mosques. Homosexual behaviour is illegal. Photography: It is not permitted to photograph government or military buildings. Tigrinya, Tigre, Arabic and English are spoken. English is rapidly becoming the language of business and education.

The country can be divided into three major zones: the central highlands, the coastal region, and the western lowlands. Each has a different climatic pattern. In the highlands, the hottest month is usually May with highs around 30°C (86°F). Winter is between December and February with lows at night that can be near freezing and dramatic temperature differences between day and night. Asmara itself enjoys a pleasant climate all year round. There are two rainy seasons: the short rains in March and April and the main rains from late June to the beginning of September. These are unlikely to impede travel or general enjoyment of the highlands. On the coast, the months from June to September are extremely hot with daily temperatures ranging from 40°C (100°F) to 50°C (122°F) (and hotter in Dankalia). In winter the daily temperature ranges from 21°C (70°F) to 35°C (95°F). This is a good time to visit, when it is not insufferably hot and skies are invariably clear. It is always warm enough to swim, even in the winter months of February to April, which can be cloudy. The rainy season on the coast north of Dankalia falls in the winter months; in Dankalia itself, rain is extremely rare. In the western lowlands, the high temperatures are comparable to those on the coast in the hottest months of April until June. December is the coldest month with temperatures falling as low as 15°C (59°F). The rainy seasons are the same as for the highlands. If you are in the highlands during winter it is advisable to bring at least one set of warm clothes. Otherwise shirts and a couple of pairs of trousers are enough: lightweight cotton for walking, and for wearing in the evening. Despite their limited resources Eritreans are always smartly dressed and even during sandstorms in the lowlands they seem to be able to remain pristine. Eritrea has a large Muslim population and women should dress with this in mind, not exposing the knees or shoulders. This will avoid a lot of trouble, especially in the lowland areas. Shorts are not generally worn, by men or women, in Asmara or other towns, with the exception of the coast, but obviously if you are travelling in Dankalia or other out of the way areas they are practical. As a general rule, Eritreans dress modestly and you should do the same. A sunhat is essential on the coast and in the western lowlands, as too are a good pair of sunglasses. Good walking shoes or boots are essential if you are travelling anywhere other than the major cities. Trainers, flip flops or sandals are all useful, depending on the purpose of your stay. Eritrea is a land of extraordinary physical diversity. It is one of the few countries where visitors can truly experience ‘four seasons in a day’. The eastern lowlands that stretch along the Red Sea for almost 1,000km (625 miles ) offer a stunning variety of scenes, from barren deserts to towering volcanic landscapes. Scattered off the coast and its myriad coral reefs are the 350 islands of the Dahlak Archipelago. In the north is the border with North Sudan and in the south, Djibouti. The centre of the country comprises the precipitous highland plateau that appears to float in the clouds as you wind up the vertiginous slopes of the escarpment from the coast by road or even steam railway. At nearly 2,500m (8,200ft) altitude, Asmara is the highest capital in Africa. Much of the southern highlands is agricultural and borders Ethiopia. To the west of Eritrea, the plateau fractures and tumbles into the western lowlands where a desert landscape stretches out across vast plains and meets the border with the north of Sudan."
africa,eswatini,"On 19 April 2018, King Mswati III renamed Swaziland to Eswatini, meaning “Land of the Swazis”. With traditional customs still central to everyday life, the Kingdom of Eswatini (Swaziland) offers an unparalleled insight into Africa’s tribal societies in a setting that is safe and welcoming to visitors. Combine this with a varied landscape and untamed wildlife, and you have a nation ripe for exploration. Eswatini (Swaziland) holds the accolade as the only absolute monarchy in Africa (and one of only a handful left in the world). The monarch plays a central role in political and cultural life, with the country’s most important annual events, such as Independence Day, closely linked with the royal household. Though smaller events involving traditional dress and celebrations can be found across the country at almost any time of year, it is the set piece ceremonies that draw the largest number of participants. In fact, the Umhlanga (Reed Dance) festival is one of Africa’s biggest cultural events. Thousands of unmarried Swazi women travel to the round, mud-brick buildings of the royal compound at Ludzidzini, where they pay tribute to the Queen Mother with reeds, song and dance. The Incwala, or Kingship Ritual, takes place during the summer solstice and is a rare survivor of what was once common across southern Africa. The highlight of the festival is the spectacular sight of Swazi men in full battle regalia, the likes of which you will not have seen outside a Hollywood blockbuster. Eswatini (Swaziland) also hosts a great diversity of landscape, ranging from river valleys and cool mountainous Highveld in the west, and hotter and dryer Lowveld in the east. A typical African landscape of acacia-dotted grasslands, the Lowveld is where the country’s most iconic wildlife can be viewed. Mkhaya Game Reserve, one of 17 protected areas, is considered one of the very best places in Africa to witness rhino in their natural habitat. Friendly, safe and spirited, the country’s distinct and ever-present cultural traditions, together with its landscapes and wildlife, make this small land-locked country a unique and enticing destination. 17,364 sq km (6,704 sq miles). 1,343,000 (2016). 78 per sq km. Mbabane. Absolute monarchy. King Mswati III since 1986. Prime Minister Russell Dlamini since 2023.","Following the Boer War of 1899-1902, Eswatini (Swaziland) became a British Protectorate in 1907 and later became independent in September 1968. After independence, the British refused to hand over Swazi territory to South Africa, and instead administered Eswatini (Swaziland) as a 'High Commission Territory' – one of three established by a 1910 Act of Parliament. Since independence, the country's domestic politics have suffered constant turbulence. Between 1973 and 1978, the constitution was suspended and a state of emergency imposed at the instigation of the king. Political parties, public gatherings and freedom of speech were all outlawed. In 1978, a new constitution concentrated political power in the hands of the monarch, who appointed a prime minister and cabinet; the state of emergency remained in force, however. An elected parliament of 30 members, the Libandla, was established, although its functions were restricted to conveying advice to the king and his principal advisory body, the Liqoqo (Supreme Council of State). The current monarch, King Mswati III, was crowned in April 1986. Political stability continued to prove elusive during the late-1980s – the Mswati monarchy was repeatedly threatened by plots organised by dissident members of the royal family and disaffected politicians but all were stifled with apparent ease. The focus of opposition has been the People's United Democratic Movement (PUDEMO), which operated largely clandestinely until February 1992, when it declared itself a legal opposition party – in contravention of the government ban on political association – and demanded a constitutional referendum. Although steady pressure has been exerted against the king from both inside and outside the country, he remains impervious to any entreaties and continues to be one of the world's few absolute monarchs. The current premier, who took up the post in 2008, is Barnabas Sibusiso Dlamini. Eswatini’s (Swaziland's) foreign relations are dominated by South Africa. In general, foreign relations have undergone a steady improvement since 1994 and the advent of majority rule in South Africa. However, there are a number of territorial disputes in which Eswatini (Swaziland) claims tracts of land in the KwaZulu-Natal and Mpumalanga provinces. Eswatini (Swaziland) is a poor country and has suffered from several serious food shortages. Moreover, according to a January 2003 World Health Organisation report, the country has the world's highest per capita incidence of HIV/AIDS, with an estimated 40% of the adult population afflicted. Average life expectancy was 35 years and falling. However, due to the implementation of better HIV/AIDS awareness, and increased access to medication and condoms, the average life expectancy has increased to 49 years and the prevalence of HIV/AIDS has decreased to around 27% in 2016 - although it still holds the title of the country with the highest prevalence. 82% Zionist (mix of Christianity and traditional beliefs). Traditional ways of life are still upheld and Swazi culture, in the form of music, dance, poetry and craftsmanship, plays an important part in daily life. Casual wear is standard, although formal wear is customary at casinos and sophisticated hotels. Visitors wishing to camp near villages should first inform the local chief. Photography: Permission to photograph individuals should always be sought. In some cases, a gratuity fee may be required, especially if the subject has gone to some effort - for example, by wearing traditional regalia. It is prohibited to photograph the royal palace, the royal family, uniformed police, army personnel, army vehicles or aircraft and bank buildings. English and siSwati.","Due to variations in altitude, the weather can be changeable. In the Highveld region, temperatures are relatively mild, ranging from between 5°C (41°F) and 21°C (70°F) in the winter, and between 13°C (55°F) and 25°C (77°F) in the summer. The Lowveld has a warmer, drier climate, with average temperatures ranging from 8°C (46°F) to 27°C (81°F) in the winter, and from 18°C (64°F) to 32°C (90°F) in the summer.  Choosing when to visit Eswatini (Swaziland) is a matter of personal preference. The wet summer season, between October and March, can be unbearable in the Lowveld but pleasant in the Highveld. Hikers should aim for an early start during the summer, as the midday heat can get intense and afternoon electrical storms are also quite common. Heavy rains can also have a negative impact on activities such as white-water rafting and caving. The dry winter season, between June and August, is usually mild in the Lowveld but can get quite cold in the Highveld. In the dry season, there is a lack of lush vegetation which makes it easier to see the wildlife. However, since the wildlife reserves throughout the country are so small, it’s always fairly easy to see game all year round. Visit during the rainy season, though, if you want to witness the variety of birds Eswatini (Swaziland) has to offer. Bring light clothing, such as linens, and a jacket for the evenings. Waterproofs are rarely needed unless you're doing a lot of walking between October and March. Since hiking is the best way to see the beautiful landscape, hiking boots or sturdy trainers are a must. Eswatini (Swaziland) is surrounded to the north, west and south by the Mpumalanga province of South Africa and to the east by Mozambique. There are four main topographical regions: the Highveld Inkangala – a wide ribbon of partly reforested, rugged country including the Usutu pine forest; the Peak Timbers in the northwest; the Middleveld, which rolls down from the Highveld through hills and fertile valleys; and the Lowveld, or bush country, with hills rising from 170 to 360m (560 to 1,180ft). The Lubombo plateau is an escarpment along the eastern fringe of the Lowveld, comprising of mainly cattle country and mixed farmland. Eswatini’s (Swaziland's) four major rivers are the Komati, Usutu, Mbuluzi and Ngwavuma."
africa,ethiopia,"Putting its turbulent history behind, Ethiopia has been busy transforming its economy and making remarkable progress in infrastructure development over the past two decades. Today tourists are returning to the country in increasing numbers, keen to discover its wondrous landscapes, ancient religious sites and fascinating indigenous tribes. Billed as 'The Land of Origins' by the Ethiopian Tourism Organisation, this amazing country is where the Blue Nile begins and home of the 3.2-million-year-old hominid fossil 'Lucy', whose discovery has put Ethiopia on the map as the cradle of humanity. One of the oldest Christian nations in the world, Ethiopia is a multi-ethnic and multifaceted destination where the art of hospitality is alive and well. Visitors are typically greeted with a steaming cup of coffee, which is said to be first discovered in the region of Kaffa in southeast Ethiopia. Most visitors start their Ethiopian odyssey in the capital Addis Ababa, a lively city nestling in the lofty Entoto Mountains. Founded in 1886 by Emperor Menelik II after his wife Empress Taytu chose the site for its hot mineral springs, Addis Ababa has enjoyed a fascinating transformation over a relatively short period of time. The city is now a hub of international missions and embassies, including the headquarters of the African Union and the UN Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA). Few linger long in the Ethiopian capital, choosing instead to head north to Lalibela, a pilgrimage site famed for its ancient churches which have quite literally been hewn out of a cliff. Lalibela is one of nine UNESCO World Heritage Sites in Ethiopia. Other notables include the ancient Kingdom of Aksum (or Axum), the fairytale castle of Gondar, the walled city of Harar, the Konso cultural landscape, the prehistoric sites of Awash and Omo valleys, the mysterious stelae of Tiya and the spectacular Simien National Park where the indigenous Gelada baboon and Walia Ibex thrive. Ultimately, it is Ethiopia's epic landscapes that truly capture the imagination of many travellers. From the cloud-shrouded peak of Ras Dashen (the highest mountain in Ethiopia) to the sulphur fumaroles of the Danakil Depression (which is also the lowest point in Ethiopia at 125m/410ft below sea level), the scenery could inspire paintings, provoke poetry. These wild environments sustain ancient tribes such as the Bodi, whose men live on a diet of blood and milk in a bid to become the region's fattest man of the year, and the Hamer, famous for their dangerous bull-jumping ceremony which is considered a rite of passage for young men. Ethiopia has come a long way since the famine of 1983-85 which prompted Bob Geldof to write the fundraising hit Do They Know It's Christmas? (by a curious twist of fate, he now owns a stake in a wine company in Ethiopia). This country, long misunderstood by many, is now enjoying a booming economy, posting a strong and sustainable 8% to 11% growth rate since the turn of the 21st-century. With Ethiopian Airlines boasting a wide network of air routes radiating from Addis Ababa, travelling to and around the country is getting easier, and for those who ride it out, the rewards are immense. 1,104,300 sq km (426,372 sq miles). 107.53 million (2018) 102 per sq km Addis Ababa Federal Democratic Republic President Sahle-Work Zewde since 2018. Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed since 2018.","Thanks to the discovery of the hominid fossil Lucy, Ethiopia is much touted as the cradle of humanity. As part of the Land of Punt, the people here enjoyed trade with the ancient Egyptians some 5,000 years ago and then, around 3,500 years ago, Ethiopia's first great civilisation arose. Various kingdoms then spawned, the most famous being the Aksumite Kingdom (100AD to 940AD). Dynasties rose, flourished and fell throughout the region up until the 19th-century, uniting and then splitting the country into feuding states. Ethiopia can lay claim to be the only country in Africa to have never been fully colonised, despite the best efforts of the Italians, who suffered a series of devastating defeats at the hands of the Ethiopians in the late 19th-century and made a successful (but short-lived) occupation between 1936 and 1941. The first half of the 20th century was dominated by Haile Selassie, who became emperor in 1930. Widespread discontent with continuing imperial rule led to a military coup in 1974, bringing the Derg to power. In 1977 a further coup established Lieutenant Colonel Mengistu as ruler. Ethiopia slid into a state of terror as mass arrests and executions became commonplace. A multitude of armed opposition groups rose up across Ethiopia in response, ushering in the start of Ethiopia's civil war. It was the civil war, along with severe drought, economic mismanagement and mutual mistrust between the government and Western aid agencies that contributed to the widespread Ethiopian famine of 1983. The war ended in 1991 when the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) took control of the capital. Not long after, in 1993, Eritrea extricated itself from Ethiopia, and tension continues between the two governments. EPRDF leader, Meles Zenawi, was elected head of a transitional administration and became Ethiopia's first democratically elected prime minister after elections in 1995. Since then, more political parties have been created and the government is keen to reform and encourage economic growth. Did you know? •	Rastafarians believe Ethiopia's former emperor, Haile Selassie, is an incarnation of Christ. •	Ethiopia is the only country in the world to have a 13-month year. The first 12 months have exactly 30 days for each month and the 13th month has five or six days. •	Coffee is thought to have been discovered in the Kaffa region when a shepherd found his goats behaving oddly after eating the plant. Ethiopian Orthodox Church, 43%; Islam (mainly in the east and south), 35%; Traditional religions and Protestants are also significant. Religion permeates nearly every facet of Ethiopian life and society. Fasting, as part of a religious ritual, is common. Ethiopian society is rather conservative with traditional values very much in place. Many Ethiopians also harbour a strong national identity, taking pride in their profound history as well as recent economic accomplishments. Ethiopians are a sociable bunch. They take time to greet one another and close friends may kiss three times on the cheeks. Hand-holding between two same-sex friends is a sign of affection, not a sign of a gay relationship. Eating & drinking: Only the right hand is used for eating or passing things. The left hand is used when going to the toilet and therefore considered dirty. Monasteries & churches: When visiting a monastery or a church (particularly in Lalibela), women must wear a headscarf, and cover their arms and legs. Some monasteries and churches are only open to male visitors. Women travellers should always check before entering if they're unsure. Ethiopian time: Please see the 'Doing business & staying in touch' section for an explanation on this. Photography: In smaller towns, locals will expect a small payment in return for being photographed. Video photography in famous tourist attractions normally carries a small charge. Photography may be prohibited near government buildings and military installations. Amharic is the official language, although about 80 other native tongues are spoken including Oromifa and Tigrigna. English is also widely used.

Most of the country is highland with many of its tourist destinations like Lalibela and Gondar are at an elevation above 2,000m (6,561ft). These places enjoy a considerably cooler climate year-round. Generally, the best time to visit Ethiopia is between November and February when clear, sunny days bring regular average temperatures of 25°C (77°F). This period is considered the dry season as rainfall is at its lowest. This is also a prime time for bird watching. If you're heading to the countryside, the period between September to October is an excellent time to visit as the landscapes are lushly pretty after all the rain. The best time to visit Addis Ababa, Aksum, Lalibela and Gondar The best time to visit Addis Ababa, Aksum, Lalibela and Gondar is from November to April. The rainy season (July and August) brings soaring temperatures and humid conditions to most places in Ethiopia, including Addis Ababa, Aksum, Lalibela and Gondar. July is the wettest month for Gondar and Aksum, while August is the wettest month for Addis Ababa and Lalibela. March, April, May, June, September and October are considered the shoulder months. It's typically cheaper to travel during these months, but you may get a short burst of rain every now and then. Visitors may also want to coincide your travel with colourful festivals. September 11 is Ethiopian New Year while September 27 is Meskel, which marks the discovery of the True Cross by the Roman Empress Helena. The biggest celebration takes place in Addis Ababa's Meskel Square. Other big days include Gena or Ledet celebrated on January 7, this is considered the Ethiopian Christmas when families gather to enjoy doro wat (chicken stew) with injera. Timkat, the Ethiopian Orthodox equivalent to Epiphany, is celebrated on January 19. The best place to see this festival is Gondar where the Fasil's Pool is filled with water for a re-enactment of the first baptism. The best time to visit the Lower Omo Valley The best time to visit the Lower Omo Valley is from January to April. The weather is dry but hot (particularly in areas around Turmi) and there are many traditional ceremonies taking place. The best time to visit the Danakil Depression Situated in northern Ethiopia near the border with Eritrea, the Danakil Depression sits at the juncture of three tectonic plates and is one of the hottest places on earth with temperatures regularly top 41°C (106°F). There really is no best time to visit this otherworldly place, although some tours may claim that temperatures are more tolerable from October to February. Due to vast altitude differences between highland and lowland areas, if you plan to explore Ethiopia fully you should prepare for a wide range of temperature differences. Bringing clothes that can be easily layered is the obvious choice. You will also need lightweight clothing for the lowlands and medium-weight for the hill country. At least one warm sweater or pullover should be brought along to cope with dramatic temperature drops once the sun goes down. Please note that many churches and monasteries (particular in Lalibela) require women to wear a headscarf and cover their arms and legs. Ethiopia is situated in northeast Africa, in the area known as 'The Horn of Africa'. It is bordered by Eritrea, Sudan, South Sudan, Kenya, Somalia, the self-proclaimed separatist territory of Somaliland, and Djibouti. Encompassing an area of 1,104,300 sq km (426,372 sq miles), it is roughly twice the size of France and is completely landlocked. The central area is a vast highland region of volcanic rock forming a watered, temperate zone surrounded by hot, arid, inhospitable desert. The Great Rift Valley (which starts in Palestine, runs down the Red Sea and diagonally southwest through Ethiopia, Kenya and Malawi) slices through the central mountain ranges. The escarpments on either side of the country are steepest in the north where the terrain is very rugged. Within the country there is a huge diversity in altitude. The highest point is at Ras Dashen in the Simien Mountains, which at 4,550m (14,930 ft) is Africa's 10th tallest mountain. The lowest point is inside the Danakil Depression which reaches 125m (410ft) below sea level. To the south, the landscape is generally flatter and much of the east and southeast is taken over by semi-arid scrubland. Although mass- deforestation has been a problem since the Middle Ages, the lowlands are still noted for their verdant evergreen forests. Ethiopia is home to four major river systems, the most important being the Blue Nile which begins at Lake Tana."
africa,gabon,"Gabon is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean, Equatorial Guinea, Cameroon and the Congo. The 800km- (500-mile-) long sandy coastal strip is a series of palm-fringed bays, lagoons and estuaries. The lush tropical vegetation (which covers much of the interior) gives way in parts to the savannah. There are many rivers along which settlements have grown. Many of the Bantu people are concentrated in coastal areas and villages along the banks of the many rivers. The main cities are Libreville, Port Gentil, Lambaréné, Moanda, Oyem, Mouila and Franceville. The Republic of Gabon moved peacefully into independence (from France) in 1960. President Omar Bongo, who succeeded Léon M'Ba as president on the latter's death in 1967 is now one of Africa's longest serving heads of state. In 2003, a change of constitution meant that Bongo could run for office as many times as he wanted and Bongo, now in his 70s, is likely to remain as president for life. Gabon's only problem in the region concerns the island of Mbagne which lies in the Corisco Bay, potentially the site of large oil and gas deposits: occupied by Gabon in 1970, it is also claimed by Equatorial Guinea. But touristic natural resources are likely to centre around features such as stunning white beaches, an abundance of wildlife, including gorillas, panthers, parrots and elephants, and verdant forests. 267,667 sq km (103,347 sq miles). 1,763,142 (UN estimate 2016). 6.4 per sq km.

Interim prime minister: Raymond Ndong Sima since 2023.","The oldest human artefacts to have been discovered in Gabon are stone spearheads dating back to 7000 BC, but little more is known about Gabonese prehistory. The earliest of the present inhabitants are the Pygmies who arrived from central Africa in around AD 1100. They were followed into the region over several centuries by various Bantu tribes including the Fang. Europeans first discovered Gabon in 1474, when the Portuguese sailor Lopez Gonzalvez entered the Gabon estuary. Between the 16th and 18th centuries the region became part of the Loango Kingdom, though from a European perspective trade became the watchword of the next four centuries, with European empires negotiating with coastal tribes for slaves and ivory from the interior. The slave trade ceased in the middle of the 19th century, but not before it had destroyed the social inter-relationships of the tribes it affected. Land on either side of the Gabon Estuary was annexed peacefully by the French during the mid-19th century as a province of French Equatorial Africa. The Republic of Gabon moved peacefully into independence in 1960 after a three-year period of internal self-government. A French-style constitution was adopted the following year and Léon M'ba became Gabon's first president. After seven years of stormy pluralism, the ruling Parti Démocratique Gabonais (PDG) declared Gabon a one-party state, but retained broadly pro-Western policies. Gabon’s current president, President Ali Bongo Ondimba, took office in 2009, and is the son of President Omar Bongo – one of Africa's longest serving heads of state. From 1990, in common with much of the rest of Africa, Omar Bongo’s government effected the transformation from a one-party state to a pluralistic political system. At the heart of the country's policies lie exceptionally close relations with France. In particular, Gabon is a key supplier to France of uranium and a number of other strategic minerals. Did you know? •	Gabon is home to 80% of the world’s gorilla population. •	President Omar Bongo was one of the longest serving heads of state anywhere in the world, with a presidency lasting 42 years. •	Gabon’s rainforests are home to 777 species of bird. About 60% Christian (mainly Roman Catholic), the remainder follow Muslim and animist beliefs. Dance, song, poetry and myths remain an important part of traditional Gabonese life.Photography: It is absolutely forbidden to photograph military installations. In general, permission to photograph anything should be requested first, to prevent misunderstandings. The official language is French. The principal African language is Fang. Eshira is spoken by a tenth of the population. Bantu dialects spoken include Bapounou, Miene and Bateke.","Equatorial with up to 80% humidity.

The lush tropical vegetation (which covers about 82% of the interior) gives way in parts to the savannah. There are many rivers and they remain the main communication routes along which settlements have grown. Of the 40 or so Bantu tribes, the largest are the Fang, Eshira, Mbele and Okande. Only a small percentage of native Gabonese live in the towns, as the population is concentrated in the coastal areas and the villages along the banks of the many rivers, following a more traditional rural style of life."
africa,gambia,"The Gambia may be mainland Africa's smallest nation, but it punches way above its weight in terms of attractions. With its glorious long sandy beaches, bustling architecturally-stunning towns and wealth of wildlife, it's perhaps the most striking of all West African countries. What's more, its people are kind and welcoming, giving The Gambia the reputation of being the 'The Smiling Coast'. Virtually enveloped by its much larger neighbour Senegal, The Gambia's narrow landmass still retains its own clear identity, despite the colonial carve up of Africa. Although this accessible Anglophone country's more obvious draw is perhaps the joy of winter sun at good-value rates, its rich history and fascinating mix of cultures make it hard to pigeonhole. If you escape the sun loungers, you will uncover another side of the country, rich in eco-tourism opportunities, wilderness, wildlife and bird watching. Inextricably linked to the Gambia River, one of Africa's great waterways, The Gambia comprises a varied landscape, featuring lush tropical forests, swamps, marshes and large areas of wooded savannah. Alongside this are Gambia's parks, reserves and riverbanks including Kiang West National Park and River Gambia National Park, where you’ll see all kinds of wildlife, including monkeys, crocodiles, a small population of hippos and well over 500 bird species. Of course, one of the main attractions is the coast. There are only 80 kilometres of shoreline, but the beaches are some of the most stunning in the region. Relatively uncrowded and shaded by multitudes of swaying palm trees, you'll be forgiven for thinking you've stumbled on paradise. Tanji and Bakau are both working beaches, featuring arrays of colourful pirogues and little fishing boats, perfect for experiencing traditional activities. For awe-inspiring sunsets, pick a spot on Batokunku Beach and stretch out on the unspoilt sand. Visitors keen to experience West African music and rural culture may head off the beaten track and up-country to simple, traditional villages. All year round you'll find vibrant festivals, events full of traditional drumming, energetic dancing as well as customary wrestling matches. But for many, it is The Gambia's idyllic cocktail of sunny days, warm welcomes and relaxing Atlantic beach resorts that lures them time and again to this little slice of African heaven. 11,295 sq km (4,361 sq miles). 2,280,102 (World Bank estimate 2018) 202 per sq km.

Ancient stone circles, known as the Wassu stone circles, are evidence of an early population; however, not much is known of it. According to thecommonwealth.org, the area now known as The Gambia was part of the Ghana Empire ruled by the Serahuli between the 5th and 8th centuries. It later became part of the Mali Empire under the Susu and Mandinka in the 13th century, which declined by the 16th century. In the 15th century, Europeans started to explore the river and coast area – the River Gambia soon became a busy trading zone for gold and slaves. During the colonial period, several European powers contested ownership of the river with Britain eventually prevailing, and The Gambia became a British Protectorate in the early 1820s, surrounded by French-ruled Senegal. The drive for Gambian independence gained momentum after World War 2 and in 1961 the first universal franchise election was held, with Dawda Jawara winning. The Gambia became the last of Britain’s West African colonies to attain full independence, mainly because it was so small and poor that doubts surfaced about its economic viability. A merger with Senegal was suggested but rejected when the issue of how to share power could not be resolved. Eventually, in 1965 The Gambia achieved independence and Jawara became the country’s first Prime Minister before assuming the role of President when the country became a republic in 1970 as a member of the Commonwealth. A period of hope and relative prosperity matched by an era of political stability followed and with elections conducted every five years, The Gambia is one of the oldest multi-party democracies in Africa. However, dissatisfaction within the military and a failed coup in 1981 led to the establishment of the Senegambia Confederation in 1982, which aimed to unify the political, economic and defence structure of the two countries. The confederation lasted until 1989 when the project was aborted. Nonetheless, close relations have remained between the two since the divorce. A bloodless coup in 1994 caught everyone by surprise but was welcomed by the majority of the population and Yahya Jammeh, a military man, assumed control and promptly banned political activity. In response, Western governments withdrew support for the country and the tourist industry collapsed, only recovering when Jammeh called elections in 1996, which he won. Since the turn of the century, The Gambia has had a period of relatively high economic growth backed by a tourist boom and apparent stability. The country retains strong connections with Britain and is one of the few parts of West Africa where English, rather than French, is the official language. Under the surface, however, Jammeh became increasingly repressive and was involved in human rights violations. His time in office saw the oppression of LGBTQ+ people, anti-government journalists and opposition parties. In December 2016, Adama Barrow won the democratic election; however, Jammeh refused to concede and, after being threatened by the African Union, fled to Equatorial Guinea in January 2017. In 2018, The Gambia officially rejoined the Commonwealth after the nation announced its exit in 2013. Did you know? • Contemporary Gambian music fuses Western sounds with Sabar, the traditional drumming and dancing of the Wolof and Serer peoples. • The River Gambia is navigable deep into the continent, which made it a frequently-used site for the slave trade. Once slave trading was declared illegal in the 19th century the river became a strategic factor in its end. • The Gambia is the smallest country on mainland Africa. Over 90% Muslim, with the remainder holding either Christian or animist beliefs. Handshaking is a common form of greeting; Salaam aleikum (Peace be upon you) is the traditional greeting. Naka nga def (Wolof for: How are you?) is widely used on the coast; Kori tanante (Mandinka for: How are you?) is widely used inland. Gambians are extremely friendly and welcoming, and, in general, visitors should not be afraid to accept their hospitality. You should exercise common sense in their dealings with the persistent would-be guides, known locally as bumsters, who operate in some tourist areas. Many Gambians are Muslim, and their religious customs and beliefs should be respected by guests; however, most understand western customs and the English language. Visitors should remember that the right hand, not the left, must be used for the giving or receiving of food or objects. Casual wear is suitable, although beachwear should only be worn on the beach or at the poolside. Only the most exclusive dining rooms encourage guests to dress up for dinner. Traditional culture in music, dancing and craftsmanship flourishes in the many villages in up-country Gambia. Travellers are advised not to photograph Banjul airport or military bases, and to ask the permission of any locals if wishing to photograph them and their village. The official language is English. The most widely spoken local languages are Fula, Jola, Mandinka, Pulaar, Soninke, Serer-Sine and Wolof.","The Gambia lies in a region that arguably has the most agreeable climate in West Africa; the weather is subtropical, with distinct dry and rainy seasons. Temperatures highs tend to average 29°C (84°F) – 34°C (93°F). From mid-November to early June, coastal areas are usually dry, while the rainy season lasts from mid to late June to October. Inland, the cool season is shorter, and daytime temperatures are very high between March and June. Sunny periods occur on most days, even during the rainy season, when showers can be short and spectacular. Most charter flights run from November to May, coinciding with the time of year when the temperature is pleasant and humidity is low. November is The Gambia’s least rainy month, offering a less humid and sunny holiday. Christmas and Easter are the two busiest travel periods, while the shoulder seasons represent the best times to arrive if you wish to escape the crowds. June to August, although rainy, offer a great alternative and lush green vegetation. Bird watchers will revel in this period, as colourful species in their breeding plumage emerge. Lightweight or tropical for most of the year, with rainwear for the rainy season. The Gambia, situated on West Africa's Atlantic coast, is a thin ribbon of land, at no point wider than 50km (30 miles), running east-west on both banks of the River Gambia. In the east, where the river dwindles, the country is barely 15km (9 miles) wide. The smallest and westernmost mainland African nation, The Gambia is essentially an enclave of Senegal with whom it shares 740km (460 miles) of land border. To the west though, The Gambia is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean and has 80km (50 miles) of coastline. The country is predominantly a low plateau, which decreases in height as it nears the Atlantic coast. The plateau is bisected by the river and is broken in a few places by low flat-topped hills and by the river's tributaries. The landscape is essentially flat, with the highest point just 53m (174ft) above sea level. In the west of the country, near the coast, the riverbanks are backed mainly by mangrove swamps, while in the inland area, which extends from central Gambia to the eastern border, the river is lined by steep, red ironstone banks covered with tropical forest. Away from the river, find wooded, park-like savannah, with large areas carpeted by a variety of trees such as baobab, silk-cotton, mahogany and oil palm. On the coast, the river meets the Atlantic with impressive sand cliffs and 50km (31 miles) of beaches, the best of which are broad, palm-fringed and strewn with shells."
africa,ghana,"They call Ghana “Africa for beginners”, which in many ways is quite the compliment. It’s a friendly and largely safe country, with a list of enticements as long as an Accra traffic jam: for a start, you’ll find sunshine, beaches, wildlife, national parks and a deeply colourful cultural heritage. The long tropical coastline is in some ways the most natural draw card for travellers, but you’re unlikely to come to Ghana for the sole purpose of lying on a beach. There’s too much going on for that. The capital, Accra, is a vibrant but often misunderstood city, a heaving metropolis of food stalls and football shirts, music and markets, swish hotels and swirling street life. It has few big sights as such, but makes for an engaging introduction to the country as a whole. Further along the coast, there’s just as much to absorb in seaside settlements like Cape Coast, once a slave port but now a cultural destination in its own right. Its dark past is testament to the various European powers that at different times held sway in the region. Inland, meanwhile, Ghana sets out its eco-credentials with habitats ranging from savannah to dense rainforest and hiker-friendly mountains to relatively arid sub-Saharan plains. Many of the individual national parks and game reserves are rather small compared to some other African countries, but the network is extensive. In the far north, the plains of Mole National Park are still home to elephants, while in the south the forested Kakum National Park has a hugely popular treetop walkway, not to mention a range of animal and birdlife. The northern city of Kumasi, the ancient capital of the Ashanti Kingdom, is another major draw. It remains the home of the Asantehene (Ashanti King) who holds court at his palace every sixth Sunday – one of many colourful traditional festivals, full of pomp and pageantry, that can be can still be seen throughout the country. 238,533 sq km (92,098 sq miles). 28,210,000 (UN estimate 2016). 110 per sq km.

However, prior to independence on 6 March 1957, the territory was known as Gold Coast, a reference to the large volumes of gold that were mined in the interior and exported by sea following the arrival of the Portuguese in the 15th century. Over the centuries that followed, Gold Coast became the site of several dozen castles, built by various European empires to protect their trade in gold and slaves. In 1874, the Gold Coast formally became a British colony, and the territory reached its present extent after WWI, when parts of what were formerly German Togoland were annexed to its eastern border to form present-day Volta Region. In 1957, the newly independent state of Ghana became the first black African country to be granted independence. Under President Kwame Nkrumah, the country underwent rapid development. A key founder of the Organisation of African Unity (now the African Union), Nkrumah also played a leading role in international affairs, by supporting the struggle for liberation in other African colonies. Nkrumah's dictatorial tendencies resulted in a 1966 coup, which was the first of several military takeovers during a 15-year period of economic and political instability that culminated in the coup led by Flight Lieutenant Jerry Rawlings on 31 December 1981. Under Rawlings's uncompromising leadership, the decade that followed was marked by sustained economic growth, but also by high levels of dissidence and repression. In 1991, Rawlings bowed to popular pressure and enacted a new constitution returning the country to civilian rule. Rawlings won the first democratic election in 1992 and was re-elected in 1996. The election of December 2000, won by John Kufuor, led to the first transfer of power from one elected leader to another in Ghanaian history, and the country’s democracy has continued to go from strength to strength. Did you know? •	Accra, the capital, is known for its carpentry workshops, where unusually-shaped coffins including cars, mobile phones and shoes are created for clients. •	The cedi, the country’s currency, is named after a sea shell that was once used as currency. •	In 1991 Ghanaian Ferdie Ato Adoboe set the world record for running 100m backwards, with a time of 13.6 seconds. There is no official state religion, and freedom of worship is a constitutional right, but religion has a strong influence on day to day life. Indeed, Ghana emerged as the world’s most religious country in a poll conducted by the Christian Science Monitor in 2012, with 96% of respondents stating that they are religious. A 2010 census claims that 71% of Ghanaians are Christian, and around 18% Muslim, making Ghana is the only West African country where Christianity is numerically dominant. Islam is the predominant faith in the north, having arrived there via the trans-Sahara trade routes as early as the 8AD. Christianity dominates further south, with Catholicism having been introduced by the Portuguese in the late 15th century. Minority religions include Hinduism, Buddhism, Baha’i, and various traditional faiths. Ghanaians should always be addressed by their formal titles unless they specifically request otherwise. Handshaking is the usual form of greeting. It is customary in much of West Africa not to use the left hand for touching food. Photography: Permission should be sought before photographing military installations, government buildings or airports. Elsewhere, there are few restrictions on photography, but it is polite to ask before photographing a street or market scene. Many official tourist sites charge addition fees for photography and/or use of a video camera. The official language is English. Local Ghanaian languages are widely spoken, including Akan, Moshi-Dagomba, Ewe and Ga.","Ghana has a typically tropical climate thanks to its proximity to the equator and low elevations – the entire country lies below 1,000m (3300ft). Daytime temperatures are high throughout the year, approaching or surpassing 30°C (86°F) on most days, and humidity is also very high, especially along the coast. Temperatures tend to drop to around 20°C (68°F) drop at night, more noticeably in the relatively dry north than the humid south. The most temperate part of Ghana is the highlands area flanking the Volta Basin, which is often pleasantly cool after dusk. There are two rainy seasons: from March to July and from September to October Rainfall is highest in the south, with some areas receiving in excess of 2,000mm each year, but the drier north more typically receives about 800mm annually. The capital Accra, together with the coast running east to Togo and Benin, lies within the Dahomey Gap, a tract of savannah that receives relatively little rain and divides the Upper Guinean forests (running westward from central Ghana) from the Lower Guinean forests (running southward from Nigeria southward to the Congo). A noteworthy climatic phenomenon is the harmattan winds, which blow in from the northeast from December to March, bringing dust from the Sahara and reducing visibility to as little as 1km (0.6 miles). Ghana is fine to visit at all times of year, but if you have the choice, aim for the northern hemisphere winter i.e. October through to April, when humidity is lowest and the weather is typically quite dry. There are also fewer mosquitoes (and a decreased risk of contracting malaria), dirt roads are in better condition, and there is less likelihood of you or your luggage being drenched in an unexpected storm. However, photographers might want to avoid the dull ambient light and grey skies associated with the harmattan in December. Light and loose is the way to go in this humid tropical climate. Bring light trousers or skirts made of a natural fabric such as cotton, combined with a stash of cotton T-shirts, and plenty of socks and underwear, also ideally must be made from natural fabrics to prevent fungal infections. Ghanaians are relatively relaxed about dress codes, but women should keep their shoulders covered and wear a skirt below the knees in the predominantly Muslim north. One sweater or sweatshirt should be adequate, since night time temperatures are seldom chilly. As for footwear, a good pair of walking shoes with solid ankle support is a must, but you'll also want sandals or thongs. If you forget anything, don't stress: there is a massive used-clothing industry in Ghana, and having new clothes made from local fabrics is quick and affordable. Ghana is situated in West Africa between latitudes of 4°N and 12°N, and longitudes of 4°W and 2°E. It is a rectangular-shaped country bordered to the north by Burkina Faso, the east by Togo, the south by the Atlantic Ocean and the west by Côte d'Ivoire. It is bisected by the Prime Meridian (0°longitude), which runs through the port city of Tema, 25km (16 miles) east of the capital Accra, and Cape Three Points, the most southerly peninsula in Ghana, is also the closest land fall to the oceanic intersection of the Prime Meridian and the Equator. Ghana's coastline is dotted with sandy palm-fringed beaches and lagoons. A narrow grassy plain stretches inland from this, widening in the east, while the south and west are covered by dense rainforest. To the north are forested hills, beyond which is dry savannah and open woodland. In the far north is a plateau averaging 500m (1,600ft) in height. In the east, the Akuapim Togo hills run inland from the coast along the Togo border. The country falls almost entirely within the Volta Basin, with the Red, Black and White Volta rivers all flowing into its northern borders from Burkina Faso. Following the 1960s construction of Akosombo Dam, about 60km (37 miles) inland of the Volta Mouth, much of the river is now submerged by Lake Volta, the world’s most expansive artificial water body."
africa,guinea,"Okay, so Guinea might not be the stuff bucket lists are made of. Tarnished by the Ebola crisis and long-term political instability, it is a country most people stay away from. But for travellers who like being far, far from the beaten track, Guinea has many enticements. A land of remote hills, virgin rainforests and plunging waterfalls, this wild, West African nation is home to some mesmerising landscapes. If you like to immerse yourself in Mother Nature, you’ll love Guinea. But don’t expect an easy time of it. The country has been mired in political instability and outbreaks of violence, and it was here that the first person died from Ebola in 2014. It is also an exceptionally poor country and beyond the capital, Conakry, it is not an easy place to travel: corruption is rife and the ubiquitous military checkpoints intimidating. Conakry is a lot of fun, though. The city has a lively nightlife and a reasonable number of international standard restaurants serving predominantly French cuisine. Its hotel scene is hardly blazing a trail – accommodation ranges from small guesthouses to slightly run down international chains – but the city has a certain charm. If chaotic Conakry wears you thin, hop on a ferry to Iles de Los, a small archipelago floating just off the coast. The antitheses to the bustling capital, these islands are blessed with clean sandy beaches, simple guesthouses and a relaxed vibe, which feels a world away from Conakry. Beyond the capital Guinea is rarely visited by tourists due to the difficulty in getting around. Public transport is crowded, uncomfortable and slow, but avoids hassle from police officers, which you are likely to attract if driving your own car. Guinea certainly isn’t for everyone, but those with a curious mind and sense of adventure will be richly rewarded. 245,857 sq km (94,926 sq miles). 12,947,122 (UN estimate 2016). 47.9 per sq km.

Portuguese explorers arrived during the mid-15th century and over the next 300 years they, along with the British and the French, made Guinea the centre of a major slave trade. In 1849, the French declared the Boke region a French protectorate. Then in 1895, the French incorporated the Boke province, the heart of the Guinea republic today, along with adjacent territory, into French West Africa. The region was a single entity comprised mostly of modern-day francophone West Africa, and governed from Dakar. After the departure of the French political power was assumed by the Democratic Party of Guinea-African Democratic Rally. By 1983, the regime's extreme mismanagement and repressive behaviour had driven an estimated two million people into exile. When the president, Sekou Touré, died in 1984 the army immediately seized power in a bloodless coup led by Colonel Lansana Conté. The Conté government straight away set about improving badly damaged political and economic links with its West African neighbours. In 1989 Conté unveiled plans for a gradual move towards democratic government. Presidential elections were held in 1993 and won by Conté. In February 1996, Conté survived an attempted coup, after which he assumed personal control of the country's armed forces. Conté was elected for a third term as President in December 2003 (after first holding a referendum in 2001 that officially removed the two-term limit on presidency). He remained in power until his death in 2008 after which Moussa Dadis Camera seized power in a coup and declared himself the head of a military junta. In 2009 soldiers brutally attacked a protest killing 157 people and raping women in the streets. Later that year Camera was shot in the head in an assassination attempt and flown out of the country for medical care. Elections were eventually held in 2010 and won by Alpha Conde. Conde survived a coup attempt in 2011 and was re-elected in 2015. Did you know? • The jazz band, Bembeya Jazz National, formed in Guinea after independence and became world-renowned for their Afrobeat rhythms. • Guinea was the only former French protectorate, which refused to join the French Community on independence. • There are 24 different ethnic groups in Guinea. The majority of the population are Muslim, with animist and Christian minorities. Although Muslim customs are less strict than in the Arab world, beliefs and traditions should be respected by tourists. Casual dress is acceptable. Street crime is relatively common. It is important to greet people and ask them how they are before starting a conversation. Guineans always use titles when addressing others, so the visitor should do likewise (Monsieur, Madame, Mademoiselle etc). Photography: A permit (applied for in advance) has to be obtained from the Ministère de l'Intérieur et de la Sécurité when photographing Government buildings, military and transportation facilities or public works.

africa,guinea-bissau,"Though better known for its military coups and government crises, Guinea-Bissau’s swashbuckling charm, faded grandeur and stunning natural assets prove some things are above politics. Sandwiched between Senegal and Guinea, this diminutive nation has a decidedly Latin vibe and is one of the few African countries to celebrate Carnival. Every February there is a riotous display of colour and culture when the streets of Bissau, the capital, are overrun with dancers festooned in traditional garb. They strut their stuff to drum beats that could raise the dead and rumbustious applause from adoring crowds. Bissau’s roads are potholed and the electricity supply is erratic, but the dilapidated capital has rugged, timeworn charm. The grandeur of its Portuguese past is well behind it: like an aged model the city’s colonial beauty has faded, but there’s still a twinkle in its eye and an affable spirit that captivates visitors. It’s small and easy to navigate, too, with a few lively bars and restaurants serving up a traditional slice of local life. For nature lovers the Bijagós Archipelago, which floats just off the coast, is a unique highlight. It is in this UNESCO-listed national park that visitors can search for rare pygmy hippos, which wallow in limpid lagoons. They’re not the only attraction: the ocean around the 88-island archipelago is home to sharks, manatees and turtles, not mention myriad migratory birds, which holiday here during the European winter. Pack your binoculars. Travelling in Guinea-Bissau is not always easy, but for those with a sense of adventure and an open mind it can be extremely rewarding.

The Portuguese had been present since the mid-15th century and had established a substantial slave trade. The territory was administered jointly with Cape Verde until 1879, after which it was treated as a separate entity and known as Portuguese Guinea until independence. Guinea-Bissau suffered a protracted war of independence (1963-1974), led on the rebel side by Amilcar Cabral, a highly respected figure inside the country, who was supported by Cuba. In 1974 a military coup in Portugal, itself partly the result of heavy losses sustained by the army in Guinea-Bissau, brought about a sudden withdrawal of the colonial authorities. The newly independent country functioned as a one-party state for the next 25 years with Joao Vieira, leader of the African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde (PAIGC), at the helm. In 1994 the government began a process of political reform, which led to multi-party elections. The PAIGC secured a clear majority in the National People's Assembly and Vieira secured the presidency. The Vieira administration was unable to tackle the country's poor and worsening economic situation. It also became embroiled in disputes with Senegal over territorial waters and alleged support for secessionist rebels in the Senegalese region of Casamance. The Casamance guerrillas' main supporter in Guinea-Bissau was Brigadier Ansumane Mane, a politically ambitious officer who in 1998 staged a rebellion against his own government. Vieira survived the attempted coup, but in 1999 Mane finally took power. From this point onwards the history becomes one of coup and counter coup. Elections took place six months later, and the PAIGC lost to the Party for Social Renewal (PRS), led by Kumba Yala. But he was also incapable of tackling the country's enormous problems and was overthrown by the military in 2003. In 2005, Joao Vieira, the former military ruler toppled in the 1999 rebellion, returned from exile in Portugal and was re-elected president only to be killed in a coup in 2009. Yet another coup followed in 2012 when Manuel Serifo Nhamadjo was installed as interim president. Jose Mario Vaz was elected President in May 2014 while the people of Guinea-Bissau hoped for stability.

africa,ivory-coast,"Ivory Coast is a country of extremes; a land of pulsating metropolises and pristine rainforests, vast churches and verdant hills, fancy restaurants and sprawling street stalls. Its reputation might be sullied by the recent civil war, but most areas are now stable and ripe for discovery. Coastal Abidjan is the unofficial capital and the entry point for most travellers. The French influence is clear to see here, not least in the food, which is served in some bistros with the kind of pomp you might expect in downtown Paris. These eateries are a stark contrast to the traditional maquis restaurants, which sprawl out onto the city’s bustling streets. Pull up a plastic pew, order some food and share a meal with locals. Dubbed the “Manhattan of Africa” the gleaming skyscrapers and manicured gardens of The Plateau give downtown Abidjan a decidedly modern feel. This commercial district is also home to St Paul’s Cathedral, which boasts impressive stained glass windows and great views across the city. While most of the action takes place in Abidjan, Yamoussoukro is the official capital. It is notable for its massive mosque and even bigger Basilica of Our Lady of Peace, which is the largest church in the world. Football is also a religion here and watching The Elephants, the national football team, offers a memorable day out for sports fans. Ivory Coast’s true beauty really shines through when you get out of the cities. There are no fewer than eight national parks in the country, including Comoé, the largest protected area in West Africa, which boasts the most biodiverse savannah in the world. Expect to see anything from lions and leopards to aardvarks and African elephants. The pygmy hippos of Tai National Park are also a big draw for naturalists, while the beautiful beaches around San Pedro,Assine and Grand Bassam attract bathers of all stripes.

Côte d'Ivoire was incorporated into French West Africa until it was granted independence in 1960. At independence, Félix Houphouët-Boigny became president, an eccentric and effective politician who dominated political life for the next 33 years through the Democratic Party of Côte d'Ivoire (PDCI). He died in December 1993 and was replaced by Henri Konan Bédié. Victory at the 1995 presidential poll, and for the PDCI at the parliamentary elections, pointed to a seamless succession. However, problems began with serious industrial unrest and the highly unpopular military intervention in the Liberian civil war. Nevertheless, a military coup in December 1999, organised by General Robert Gueï, was unexpected. An ex-minister loosely allied to Ouatarra, Gueï established a new military regime. Presidential elections were held in October 2000; the principal contenders were Gueï and Laurent Gbagbo, standing for the Ivorian Popular Front, whose main constituency is among Christians in the south. When Gueï tried to manipulate the result, he was driven into exile (where he died), leaving Gbagbo as the winner. The Rally of the Republicans (RDR) candidate, Ouattara, had been blocked from standing in the election, infuriating northern Muslims and sparking unrest. A new government, in which Ouattara's RDR was given four ministerial posts, was set up in 2002. However, fighting broke out between pro-government forces and dissident army units, and continued until 2004 with the country divided between the rebel-held north and a government-held south. In 2007 the two sides agreed to elections, but they were not held until 2010. Both Gbagbo and Ouattara claimed victory in the 2010 elections leading to violence. Gbagbo was eventually arrested and handed over to the International Criminal Court where he is being tried for triggering political unrest. Ouattara became president and has since been re-elected in a peaceful election in 2015. Did you know? • Ivory Coast is the world’s largest cocoa producer. • The Basilica of Our Lady of Peace in Yamoussoukro is the largest church in the world. • The official language of Ivory Coast is French, but it is estimated that 65 languages are spoken in the country. 34% Christian, 27% Muslim, 15% traditional beliefs. It is important to note, however, that these percentages are based on census results in 1998, of which some Muslim foreign workers may have been excluded - therefore, the Muslim percentage may be higher than is indicated here. One of the most striking features of Côte d'Ivoire, distinguishing it from many other African countries, is the extreme ethnic and linguistic variety. The size of each of the 60 groups - which include the Akar, Kron, Nzima, Hone, Voltaic and Malinke peoples - varies widely and the area they occupy may cover a whole region. With very few exceptions every Ivoirian has a mother tongue which is that of the village, along with traditions, family and social relations within their ethnic group. French has become the official language of schools, cities and government and therefore has an influence on lifestyle even at a modest level. Handshaking is normal. Small tokens of appreciation, a souvenir from home or a business gift with the company logo are always welcome. Normal courtesies should be observed and it is considered polite to arrive punctually for social occasions. Snakes are regarded as sacred by some ethnic groups. The official language is French. The main African languages are Yacouba, Senoufo, Baoulé, Betie, Attie, Agni and Dioula (the market language).","Dry from December to April, long rains from May to July, a short dry season from August to September, short rains in October and November. In the north the climate is more extreme - rains (May to October) and dry (November to April). Tropical lightweights; warmer clothing for evenings. A light raincoat in the rainy season and a hat for the sun. Casual wear is widely acceptable but beachwear should be confined to the beach or poolside. Dress tends to err on conservative - men wearing long trousers and women wearing knee-length or longer skirts, dresses and trousers. Ties need only be worn for formal occasions. Côte d'Ivoire shares borders with Liberia, Guinea, Mali, Burkina Faso and Ghana. There are 600km (370 miles) of coast on the Gulf of Guinea (Atlantic Ocean). The southern and western parts of the country are forested, with undulating countryside rising to meet the savannah plains of the north and the mountainous western border. Three rivers, the Sassandra, the Bandama and the Comoé, run directly north-south and, on their approach to the coast, flow into a series of lagoons. Birdlife is plentiful throughout the country, but particularly so near the coast."
africa,kenya,"Lions and leopards are just part of the landscape in Kenya, one of East Africa's favourite safari destination. More than 40 national parks and nature reserves are scattered between Lake Victoria and the Indian Ocean, covering every imaginable landscape and featuring just about every animal in Africa: from aardvarks to zebras. As you might expect, wildlife safaris are the lifeblood of Kenyan tourism, and the infrastructure for travellers is impressive. Jeeps, buses and light aircraft fan out daily across the country to safari lodges and tented camps, some simple and rustic, others lavish and opulent. Refreshingly, you can enjoy close encounters with nature even on a budget, with walking safaris run by tribal guides and economic-tented camps that scrimp on creature comforts, but not on creatures. Most people start their journey in Nairobi, Kenya's capital city, but few linger when there are more attractive cities strung out along the sun-kissed Kenyan coast and dotted around the Great Rift Valley. Whether you pick the interior or the coast (with its beach resorts and Islamic ruins), you can be sure to find a national park or reserve close at hand. Even Nairobi has a national park within the city limits, with zebras and giraffes just a stone's throw from the suburbs. Kenya is also a great place for cultural encounters, with more than 40 different tribal groups, each following its own unique way of life. The semi-nomadic Maasai tribe, with their multi-coloured, bead-covered adornments, is perhaps the most obvious group, but visiting any tribal village is a fascinating and enlightening experience. On appearances, Kenya would seem like the perfect holiday destination, but tourism has had its ups and downs in recent years, with political upheaval during elections and a string of high-profile militant attacks in Nairobi and along the coast. These setbacks have made a noticeable dent in Kenya's tourist industry, yet travellers still flock to the teeming plains of the Maasai Mara and trek the slopes of Mount Kenya, and the biggest decision for most is not whether to go to Kenya, but instead, which wild animal to search for first. 580,367 sq km (224,081 sq miles). 52,580,497 (2019). 79.2 per sq km. Nairobi. Republic. President William Ruto since 2022. President William Ruto since 2022.","Kenya has seen human habitation since the beginning of the Lower Palaeolithic period – the earliest subdivision of the Palaeolithic or Old Stone Age. The Bantu expansion (a major series of migrations of the original proto-Bantu language speaking group) from a West African centre reached the area by the 1st millennium AD. Over the past few millennia, Kenya has been settled by a large number of migrants from all over Africa, among the most recent arrivals being the Maasai, who crossed from present-day South Sudan in the 17th century. The mediaeval Kenyan coast was a prosperous maritime trade centre serving ships from Arabia and Asia. Many modern ports, including Lamu and Mombasa, date from this era. The Portuguese arrived on the coast in the early 16th century, followed by Omani Arabs in the 18th century, and the British in the mid-19th century. It was only in the 1890s that outsiders penetrated far into the interior, resulting in the British construction of the 'Lunatic Line' from Mombasa to Kampala (Uganda). Nairobi, founded as a staging point along this railway line, became the headquarters of the British colonial administration. In the early 20th century, the fertile highlands around Nairobi attracted an influx of European settlers. This resulted in a liberation movement demanding greater territorial, economic and political rights for locals. Led by Jomo Kenyatta, the fight for independence gathered pace after World War II, culminating in the 1950s with a bloody three-year guerrilla war between the Mau Mau and the British colonial authorities. Kenya was granted independence in 1963, and the Kenyan African National Union (KANU), led by Kenyatta, took power. Kenyatta died in 1978, and was succeeded by Daniel Arap Moi, an autocrat who banned opposition parties outright in 1982. A multi-party system was restored in the early 1990s, but Moi remained in power until the 2002 election, which was won by the National Alliance Rainbow Coalition (NARC), led by Mwai Kibaki, who became the country's third president. Over the past few years, Kenya has been plagued by terrorism. In April 2015, Al-Shabab militants carried out a massacre at Garissa University College in northwest Kenya, killing 148 people, and in January 2016, Al-Shabab claims to have killed more than 100 Kenyan soldiers in a dawn raid on a base in southern Somalia. Despite unrest, Kenya continues to invest in infrastructure projects including the multi-billion-dollar railway line linking Mombasa to the capital Nairobi and pushing for tourism. Did you know? • In 2004 Wangari Mutu Maathai became the first African woman to receive the Nobel Peace Prize, awarded to her for her contribution towards sustainable development, peace and democracy. She died in 2011 of complications from Ovarian cancer. • In the London Marathon 2019, Kenya runner Eliud Kipchoge became the first man to win four London Marathons, and set a new record of 2:02:37. • 2,493 railway workers were killed, many by lions, while building the Lunatic Line in the late 1800s during the Scramble for Africa. About 80% of Kenya's population is Christian (mostly Catholic and Protestant); Muslim 11% and others 6%. Western European habits prevail throughout much of Kenya as a result of British influences in the country. Kenyans are generally very friendly. The standard greeting of 'hello' when addressing an individual is Jambo, to which the reply is also Jambo. People are delighted if visitors can greet them in Swahili. The dress code is informal and casual lightweight clothes are accepted for all but the smartest social occasions. Because of its Muslim influence, the coast is a little more conservative than the rest of the country. Away from the beach, women and men should dress respectably and cover up bare arms and legs. Alcohol is only available in the tourist areas on the coast. Plastic bags: The possession of plastic bags is prohibited in Kenya. Persons who don't follow the rule of law will be fined for this infringement. Swahili and English are the two official languages in Kenya. Kikuyu and Luhya are widely spoken.","Kenya has three types of climate: temperate subtropical climate in the west and southwest highlands (where Nairobi is located), hot and humid along the coast, and hot and dry in the north and east. Nairobi is the capital and the largest city in Kenya and experiences a subtropical highland climate. Sitting at 1,795 metres (5,889 ft) above sea level, Nairobi's evenings are cooler. The best time to visit Nairobi is from June to August when the average high is around 23°C (73°F) and rainfall is at its lowest (although the sky is often cloudy). The period between January to February is also a good time to visit Nairobi as it is sunny and warm, with an average high of 27°C (81°F). The short rainy season from late October to December and from March to May should be avoided. Mombasa is a coastal city and the second-largest city after Nairobi, situated along the Indian Ocean. This city has a tropical wet and dry climate. Avoid April and May as these are the wettest months and the area can be affected by flooding. The best time to visit Mombasa is either July to September as sunshine is abundant, as well as from October to March for aquatic activities. Malindi, a town on Malindi Bay at the mouth of the Galana River, is also situated alongside the Indian Ocean coast and is 120km (75 miles) northeast of Mombasa. Malindi has a tropical dry savannah climate. The cooler season from June to September sees the average high at 27/28°C (81/82°F), while the average high can reach 31°C (88°F) during the hotter season from November to March. With regards to rainfall, it is not particularly abundant, as it only amounts to about 1,000 millimetres (40 inches) per year, however, there are two rainy seasons: from April to June and October to November. Masai Mara is an expansive game reserve renowned for its wealth of wildlife and the Great Migration of wildebeest to and from the Serengeti every year. This area is located just south of the equator at an altitude of between 1,500 and 1,900 metres (5,000 and 6,200 ft). The climate is pleasantly warm all year round, averaging 23°C (73°F), although it is widely classified into two seasons - dry and wet. The dry season (late June to October) is best for safari as wildlife is easier to spot given that the bush is less dense and animals gather around waterholes and rivers. During this period, the days are clear with sunny skies, with fewer mosquitos, and the average high is around 25°C (77°F). The wet season is from November to May with April being the wettest month, does result in beautiful scenery, cheaper rates and newborn animal sightings. For Nairobi and the coast: lightweight cottons and linens are advised. Warmer clothing is needed in June and July, while rainwear is advisable between March and June, and October and December. For safari: loose-fitting and light neutral tones are recommended. If you are visiting a luxury lodge, pack a nice set of clothes for dinner is recommended. Kenya covers 580,367 sq km (224,081 sq miles) and sits astride the equator. It shares borders with Ethiopia in the north, Sudan in the northwest, Uganda in the west, Tanzania in the south and Somalia in the northeast. To the east lies the 480 km (300 miles) Indian Ocean coastline. The country is divided into four regions: the arid deserts of the north; the savannah lands of the south; the fertile lowlands along the coast; and highlands in the west, where the capital Nairobi is situated. Northwest of Nairobi runs the Rift Valley, dotted with lakes and containing the town of Nakuru, while further west the Aberdare National Park is overlooked by Kenya’s highest peak, and Africa’s second tallest mountain after Mount Kilimanjaro, Mount Kenya (5,199m/17,057ft), which also is a national park. In the far northwest is Lake Turkana (formerly Lake Rudolph), and in the southwest is Kenya's share of Lake Victoria."
africa,lesotho,"Tucked away in the heart of South Africa sits the Kingdom of Lesotho, known to locals as the Kingdom of the Sky and to travellers as the Switzerland of Africa. As the nicknames suggest, Lesotho is mostly made up of the rolling highlands and dramatic, rugged peaks of the Maloti Mountains, the tallest of which stands at a shade under 3,500m (11,482ft) above sea level. Lesotho is the only independent state in the world that is entirely above 1,000m (304m) altitude. The high altitude and mountainous geography lend a spectacularly scenic backdrop to the numerous outdoor activities on offer, including pony trekking, rock climbing, fishing, abseiling, hiking, bird watching, mountain biking and even skiing on the snow-covered slopes below the Mahlasela Pass. The existence of valuable mineral and water resources led developers to build roads through some areas of Lesotho, but much of the kingdom and its villages remain remote and can only be reached on foot, by horseback or by light aircraft. But Lesotho’s remoteness is a large part of its appeal, and this also helps preserve the rich traditional culture of the Basotho people, which you can experience at a number of cultural villages dotted across the kingdom. Lesotho also boasts some prominent examples of ancient rock paintings made by the nomadic San people that once inhabited this area. Since Lesotho gained its independence from the British, poverty and unemployment have seen this protectorate lose a large percentage of its population to South Africa’s mines, while those that stayed behind have had to live with one of the world’s highest rates of HIV, which in turn has had detrimental effects on the country’s economy. But while Lesotho might not be able to boast the wealth and infrastructure of its much larger neighbour, when it comes to raw adventure and natural beauty it can certainly hold its own. 30,355 sq km. 2,160,309 (UN estimate 2016). 64.2 per sq km. Maseru. Constitutional monarchy. King Letsie III since 1996. Prime Minister Sam Matekane since 2022.","In the 1800s Southern Africa was a region of great turmoil with various tribes occupying the land and frequent battles between neighbouring clans. The indigenous tribes that occupied the area now known as Lesotho were ousted by chief Moshoeshoe who established his own stronghold at Thaba Bosiu, 24km (15 miles) east of Maseru. He gained a reputation for his ability to stave off attacks from subsequent marauders and over time, the numbers under his rule increased. However, in 1867, prompted by the increasing pressure of attacks from the Boers, Moshoeshoe asked the British for protection in and in doing so, Lesotho (then known as Basutoland) became a British protectorate, which meant being under control of Cape Colony. This caused considerable tension which finally came to a head with the Gun War of 1880, and resulting in the country coming under direct rule from London. Lesotho rejected an offer to become part of South Africa in 1910 and finally gained independence in 1966, a step which has brought its own set of problems. The country became a constitutional monarchy with elected parliament, but subsequent ruling regimes have been unstable, with military coups, governmental collapses and a monarchy in turmoil, which saw King Moshoeshoe II deposed twice, before dying in a car accident. His son King Letsie III is now king and the country is currently under democratic rule by the All Basotho Convention party, headed by Prime Minister Thomas Thabane. Much of Lesotho’s cultural legacy is tied up in its colonial one, with the architecture of older building in main towns such as Maseru bearing overtones of European influence. However, Lesotho’s past is still very much visible in the present and one can still see the cave drawings of the San bushmen and fossilised dinosaur trails that date back millions of years. In the rural areas which are often only accessible by foot or horseback, people’s way of life has not changed significantly for generations, with subsistence agricultural farming remaining the main source of income for families. As in much of southern Africa, Aids and HIV are widespread throughout Lesotho, with around 23% of the adult population being infected. The government has stepped up efforts to combat the infection’s spread, sometimes working in conjunction with philanthropic efforts by NGOs, but it remains an incalculable task to deal with the pandemic and its consequences. Around 80% Christian; mainly Anglican, Roman Catholic and Lesotho Evangelical. Indigenous beliefs account for the remaining 20%. If spending some time in rural villages, it is polite to inform the head chief. It is likely that he will be very helpful. Normal social courtesies and a friendly, warm approach will be greatly appreciated. Dress should be practical and casual but local customs should be respected (including those regarding modesty in dress). Religion plays an important part in daily life.Photography: Photographs must not be taken of the following: the palace, police establishments, government offices, the airport or monetary authority buildings. Sesotho and English.","Temperate climate with well-marked seasons. Summer is the rainy season; 85% of rainfall occurs from October to April, especially in the mountains. Snow occurs in the highlands from May to September. The hottest period is from January to February. Lesotho is a land of clear blue skies and more than 300 days of sunshine a year. During the summer, lightweight cottons with warmer wear for the evenings is needed. In winter, medium- to heavyweight clothes are advised. Waterproofing is necessary during the rainy season. Lesotho is a landlocked country surrounded on all sides by South Africa. It is a mountainous kingdom situated at the highest part of the Drakensberg escarpment on the eastern rim of the South African plateau. Its mountainous terrain is cut by countless valleys and ravines, making it a country of great beauty. To the west, the land descends through a foothill zone of rolling hills to a lowland belt along the border where two-thirds of the population live. Three large rivers, the Caledon, the Orange and the Tugela, rise in the mountains."
africa,liberia,"They say all publicity is good publicity, but Liberia might argue otherwise. Africa’s oldest republic has barely been out of the headlines in recent decades, but for all the wrong reasons; reports from the country have been dominated by two civil wars and an outbreak of Ebola. Suffice to say tourists have stayed away. But Liberia has come a long way since the dark days of its civil war. The 2013 Ibrahim Index of African Governance proclaimed this small West African nation to be the most improved country on the continent – and many are hoping Liberia will continue in this vein. Assuming it does, adventurous travellers will likely be tempted back to this small, coastal nation; a country characterised by its windswept golden beaches, luscious rainforests and verdant savannahs, where twittering birds, screeching monkeys and stomping elephants provide a wild soundtrack. But there’s more to this country than natural wonders. Founded by freed American and Caribbean slaves, Africa’s oldest republic is home to a staggering diversity of cultures; its four million odd inhabitants are comprised of more than 16 established peoples, and there’s a burgeoning Asian and Middle Eastern population, too. Art has long played an important role in Liberian culture, and the country’s various ethnic groups are renowned for their ornate wooden sculptures, particularly wooden masks, which are said to connect the living with ancestral spirits and ancient deities. Like art, religion is also woven into the fabric of Liberian life; casual ceremonies with sacred catfish hold force even while churches and mosques are full. Liberia’s tropical climate, with a long dry season from September to June and rains peaking in August, still decide everything from transport to working schedules. During the monsoon roads become rivers and, at times, the country feels very much at the mercy of nature. Yet Liberia is very much the master of its own destiny and its emergence as a credible tourist destination will depend largely on whether peace prevails and whether there is significant investment in the country’s creaking infrastructure. 111,369 sq km (43,000 sq miles). 4,615,222 (UN estimate 2016). 37.7 per sq km. Monrovia. Republic. President Joseph Boakai since 2024. President Joseph Boakai since 2024.","Little is known for sure about this slice of West Africa prior to the 14th century. However, historians believe the indigenous population of Liberia are likely to have descended from migrants fleeing the Mali and Songhey Empires between the 13th and 16th century. During this period, European traders established contact with coastal communities whose inhabitants became fluent in many languages. The slave trade both expanded this connection to the rest of the world and caused deep changes in legal and social structures within Liberia, draining the country of skilled, youthful people. As resistance to the slave trade grew, a movement began in the USA called the American Colonisation Society (ACS), which sought to return African slaves back to their motherland. Critics say the ACS was borne out of fear that freed slaves would pose a threat to American society, but, nevertheless, the group established the colony of Liberia in 1822 and sent thousands of emancipated slaves there to start new lives. Indigenous Liberians allowed the new arrivals to share their land, but were surprised when the settlers didn’t abide by the laws of the local chiefs. Scuffles ensued. So in 1847 the settlers, aided by the United States, formed a republic to reinforce their right to rule themselves and to defend themselves against a series of indigenous attacks. Using US military support, the republic not only survived but thrived and it wasn’t until 1904 that the indigenous tribes were enfranchised in this new society. However, long-term inequality and deepening poverty resulted in the Rice Riots of 1979 and a coup d’état in 1980. However, the new regime of Sergeant Samuel Doe failed to quell unrest, which simmered over in 1989 with the outbreak of the First Liberian Civil War. Peace negotiations and elections ended the war in 1997 and saw Charles Taylor appointed president. But the peace was short-lived and in 1999 the Second Liberian Civil War broke out, drawing in neighbouring Sierra Leone and Guinea. By 2003 when the fighting finally ceased, Liberia’s brutal wars had claimed an estimated 300,000 lives. President Taylor went into exile in Nigeria, but in 2006 he was arrested for war crimes and extradited to The Hague where he was found guilty and sentenced to 50 years imprisonment. As Taylor started his sentence, the new Liberian president, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, was awarded a Nobel Peace Prize. As Africa’s first elected female president, she leads a nation described in the 2013 Ibrahim Index of African Governance as the continent’s most improved country. Did you know? • Liberia was founded by the United States in 1822 and became Africa’s first republic in 1847. • The Liberian flag is based largely on that of the USA’s – the star symbolises the freedom ex-slaves were given and the stripes represent the signatories of the Liberian Declaration of Independence. • Much of the Liberia’s revenue comes from the controversial practice of providing a “flag of convenience,” which means allowing foreign ships to register as Liberian. This enables vessel owners to bypass stringent regulations set by their home countries.

africa,libya,"Travel to Libya is ill-advised at the moment due to the ongoing civil war. And that’s a shame, because this beautiful land has much to offer the intrepid traveller. One of the largest countries in African, Libya boasts a stunning Mediterranean coastline, gorgeous desert landscapes and no fewer than seven UNESCO World Heritage Sites. These ancient sites are a reminder that Libya’s history has always been tumultuous: before Gaddafi’s regime and the ensuing civil war, the country endured Greek, Roman and Italian rule. But Libya has more to offer than war stories. From the mystical desert town of Ghadames to the stunning Sahara Desert, this is a land of empty beaches, ancient mountain trails and shimmering oases. It is a land where sand dunes stretch to the heavens, palm trees reflect in desert lakes and prehistoric rock carvings decorate the dramatic Akakus Mountains. Rural Libya is characterised by neatly cultivated olive groves, fat lemons dangling from trees and remote Berber settlements. In the cities, merchants sell wares in rose-scented souks, flogging silver, spices, henna, hijabs and Tuareg scarves. The smell of spicy lentil soup and Benghazi seafood hangs deliciously in the air. The population of Libya is mostly of Arab and Berber descent. Berbers make up about 10% of inhabitants and live in more remote areas. The rest of the population lives largely in coastal cities like Tripoli and Benghazi, although recent fighting has forced many to flee. Libyan hospitality is legendary and its people love showing travellers around. But tourism faltered after the Arab Spring and has been paralyzed by the ensuing Civil War. At the time of writing, tourist visas were not being issued and most tour companies have closed their doors – many guides now work as fixers for war reporters instead. It’s impossible to say how current events will pan out, but, like many travellers, we hope the doors to Libya will swing open again soon. 1,759,500 sq km (679,347 sq miles). 6,330,159 (UN estimate 2016). 3.6 per sq km.

Under UN direction, the country was granted full independence in 1951 and King Idris became head of state, pursuing a pro-Western foreign policy while keeping up cordial relations with other Arab states. During the 1950s and 1960s, major discoveries of oil greatly improved the economic prospects of the country. Idris was overthrown by a military coup lead by Colonel Muammar Gaddafi in 1969 and in the 1980s and 1990s Libya was ostracised from the international community because of Gaddafi's support for various revolutionary and terrorist groups, most notably the 1988 bombing of the Pan Am flight over the Scottish town of Lockerbie that killed all 270 passengers on board. UN sanctions were imposed from 1992, a measure that cost Libya billions of dollars in revenue, but when Gaddafi announced in 2003 that he would give up his nuclear weapons, sanctions were lifted and in 2006 Libya was rehabilitated and taken off the US list of states sponsoring terrorism. In 2011, as part of the Arab Spring that took place across many of the Middle East and northern African countries, there was a widespread uprising against Colonel Gaddafi's rule, resulting in civil war. Libyan forces loyal to the transitional council, supported by NATO forces, were eventually successful in their aims, resulting in the unseating Colonel Gaddafi in October 2011 and his death at the hands of his own people. Under Gaddafi a multi-party state was forbidden, but dozens of new parties have sprung up in the wake of the revolution, including the Muslim Brotherhood and the Salafis. A Libyan General National Congress was elected in 2012, then dissolved after the June 2014 elections, but reconvened by a minority of its members. The country's Council of Deputies also claimed to be the legitimate government and some areas of the country fell beyond either group's control. Following UN-sponsored peace talks between the factions the Government of National Accord was formed and entered Tobruk in April 2016. Elections are due to be held within two years.

This is all the more true since the revolution, when many people seemed to break free from the shackles imposed by the Gaddafi regime. Young men drive fast cars through the streets of Benghazi, showing off the tinted windows that were banned under the late leader's administration. And while there are no nightclubs or bars in the country yet, young people like to enjoy music and hang out in shisha cafes and shwarma joints. It's important to dress modestly wherever you go, particularly if you are female. Alcohol is forbidden and most people get married at a young age, often through arranged agreements. Weddings tend to be a three-day affair with lots of singing and emphasis on beautiful outfits. Photography: In this sparsely-populated country, expect most of your shots to be of the landscapes.

The desert has hot days and cold nights. Spring and autumn are ideal times to visit, when the warm air comes up from the Sahara and meets a cooling breeze from the Mediterranean. Libya is a huge country and weather patterns vary by region. The Mediterranean coastline is the focus of most travellers' trips to Libya. There, summers are hot and dry and winters are mild, although the evenings can be worthy of scarves and hats.You'll find similar, though slightly warmer conditions to those on the other side of the ocean, such as southern Italy and Greece. Libya's coastline can be very windy, so be sure to pack a headscarf (women should of course bring one anyway as this is a deeply conservative Muslim country) to protect your ears from being blasted by the breeze. Rainfall is sporadic and rarely heavy, but drizzly days in autumn and winter are fairly common. Temperatures in Tripoli in January range from 7 to 17°C; in July, you can expect bright sunshine, blue skies and a mercury reading of between 20 and 25°C. In the winter of 2011/12, Libya's coastline had its first snowfall in decades. The desert has hot days and cold nights; the closer to the equator you travel, the hotter the days will be. With the exception of the far southern desert close to Libya's borders with Chad, southern Egypt and Sudan, humidity is generally low. Loose, long clothes in natural fabrics are recommended. A cover-up for the cooler months is advisable. Warm clothing for nights in the desert. Modest dress is advised, especially for women - upper legs and arms, shoulders and cleavage should be covered. A headscarf can be useful as extra coverage, and is essential for visiting mosques, cemeteries or other sites that bear religious significance. About 95% of Libya, Africa's fourth largest country, consists of desert (the Sahara). In the west the Sahara desert extends into Tunisia and Algeria, in the east into Egypt, and across the southern frontiers into Niger, Chad and Sudan. Only 20% of the desert features sand dunes - most of it consists of hamada (rock plateau) and, in the south, dramatic basalt mountains, the highest point of which is Bikubiti (2285m), near the Chad border. There are a few oases scattered throughout the country, mainly in the south. There are almost 1,770 km (1,100 miles) of Mediterranean coast, with a low plain extending from the Tunisian border to the Jebel Akhdar (Green Mountain) area in the east. Inland the terrain becomes more hilly. Agriculture has developed mainly on the coast between Zuwarah and Misratah in the west and from Marsa Susa to Benghazi in the east. In the uplands of the old province of Cyrenaica and on Jebel Akhdar the vegetation is more lush. Desertification is a huge problem, but the Great Manmade River Project, the largest water development scheme in the world, was built to bring water from large aquifers under the Sahara to the coastal cities. Gaddafi left the Great Manmade River Project unfinished, but there are plans to bring in new developers sometime in the future."
africa,madagascar,"Undoubtedly one of the world’s most fascinating destinations, Madagascar floats off the coast of Mozambique, in the turquoise waters of the Indian Ocean, and is home to some of the weirdest, most wonderful wildlife in existence. A cliché it may be, but there really is nowhere quite like it. Up to 90% of the flora and fauna found in Madagascar is unique to the island, which was cut adrift from the African mainland millions of years ago and has evolved in sweet isolation since. Mother Nature had a chance to experiment in Madagascar, and experiment she did. Nowadays the island is home to around a quarter of our planet’s primates and they exist in glorious variety: big and small, social and solitary, adorably cute and downright freaky. The primates’ story is played out across the animal groups: there are several hundred types of frog, dozens of bats, over a hundred snakes (mostly small, all harmless) and almost half of the world’s chameleons. It’s a similar story where flora is concerned, too. But Madagascar is not just a nirvana for naturalists: the island offers splendid beaches, scuba diving and surfing; gnarly rock climbing and caving; lazy river trips; spectacular scenery; and warm, welcoming people with interesting beliefs and cultural practices. The island is divided along its middle by a high plateau. Lush rainforest runs in a band down the eastern side, while drier deciduous forests lie to the west. In the far south is the unique arid spiny forest, home to the island’s wackiest plant life. Giant baobab trees populate the western regions. A mix of influences provides telltale evidence of the Polynesian settlers, Arabic presence, Bantu tribes-folk and European arrivals of the past, all of which have culminated in a fascinating cultural melting pot. For sheer diversity, Madagascar hard to beat. 587,041 sq km (226,658 sq miles). 24,890,000 (UN estimate 2016). 40.6 per sq km. Antananarivo. Republic. President Andry Rajoelina since 2023. Prime Minister Christian Ntsay since 2018.","Until the French invasion of 1895, for most of the 19th century Madagascar had been a kingdom, although historically it had been ruled by a variety of alliances. It remained a French colony until achieving full independence in 1960, following a bloody uprising 13 years previously. For most of the next 40 years, former military man Didier Ratsiraka held power imposing his own brand of Christian-Marxism until his policies caused spectacular economic collapse. In the early 2000s, a businessman and former mayor of Antananarivo – Marc Ravalomanana – took over the presidency after achieving a narrow electoral victory, which Ratsiraka initially refused to accept. There followed seven years of impressive economic growth for Madagascar under Ravalomanana's leadership, accompanied by extensive development such as road building. The international community was impressed by the president's resolve to triple the protected areas of the country to around 10 per cent. Sadly, during his second term in office, he began to abuse his position for personal gain and public opinion turned against him. A young former DJ named Andry Rajoelina seized this opportunity to topple Ravalomanana in a coup d'état. Rajoelina successfully forced Ravalomanana into exile and appointed himself leader. Between 2009 and 2014, Madagascar had no internationally recognised government. Most international aid was stopped, living standards across the country dropped, the economy backpedalled and the security situation worsened. Rajoelina's stated aim was to organise democratic elections, but it soon became clear that he had no intention of giving up power. During those five years he dragged his feet and deliberately derailed plans each time election dates were set, while hurrying through constitutional changes that would favour him as a presidential candidate. Eventually he realised that the international community would never accept him as rightful president, even if he were to win free and fair democratic elections. He decided to change tack and put forward a proxy candidate called Hery Rajaonarimampianina. Elections went ahead in late 2013 and Rajaonarimampianina won, having spent eye-watering sums – thought to have come from the sale of vast quantities of illegally logged rosewood timber to China – on campaigning. He assumed the presidency in January 2014, with Rajoelina subsequently declaring his intention to run for president in the future. Did you know? • In many regions, savika – cattle wrestling – is a popular recreation. • The lamba, Madagascar's national dress, is a rectangular length of cloth wrapped around the upper body. Ceremonial lamba can be made of silk or cow hide, but everyday ones are more likely to be cotton, bast or raffia pig skin. • Libertatia, a possibly fictitious anarchist colony formed by pirates, may have been based on Nosy Boroha, a small island off the northeastern coast of Madagascar. Around 52% follow animist beliefs whilst about 41% are Christian. The remainder are Muslim. Malagasy people are extremely hospitable and welcoming with a refreshingly open communicative style that can sometimes border on direct. A handshake is the usual form of of greeting between strangers meeting for the first time. If meeting a friend then three kisses on the cheek is fine. Arrangements and meetings can suffer as a result of a relaxed attitude to clock-watching. Dress is casual, except for posh hotels and restaurants where lightweight suits are advised. Note that military-style clothing should always be avoided, as wearing it can lead to arrest. Restaurants and bars are used for entertaining, with invitations to a family home requiring a good degree of personal acquaintance. An invitation to attend a special celebration is a great honour. Acts of kindness should be rewarded with a gift, but never money. Respect should be afforded to the many local taboos (fady) of the Malagasy – these are various behaviours that you shouldn't do. Although these can change from tribe to tribe and person to person (try to be informed about what they will be before travelling to a new area on the island), some fady are imposed nationwide. Examples include not pointing at tombs, and not killing a propithecus lemur. Photography: Military, airport or police establishments should not be photographed. English is not widely spoken. Malagasy (which is related to Indonesian) and French are the official languages. Local dialects are also common.","Madagascar’s highly diverse subtropical climate means it pays to do some research before you plan a trip. Rainy season runs from December to March. This is when the rainforested eastern and northern parts of the country are battered by tropical storms brought on by cyclone season, and temperatures tend to hover around 30ºC (86ºF). Despite being rainy season up north, during this period, the central parts will be a lot drier and cooler, with temperatures around 25ºC (77ºF). The southern and western coasts are the driest parts of the country. Dry season runs from April to October but tourist numbers don't start to swell until early May. Peak months are July and August, due to the timing of school holidays in Europe and the USA. If visiting for wildlife, September to December is also a good time to visit, as many of the snakes and lizards populating the island come out of hibernation during this time. The mountains, including Antananarivo, are dry, cool and windy during this time of year, shifting to warm and thundery from November to April. Due to the extreme storms and occasional cyclones, travelling to Madagascar between January and March is ill-advised. To cope with the Madagascan climate, lightweights should be worn during the summer on high central plateaux and throughout the year in the north and south. Cotton and natural fibres work better in this sweaty weather. Warmer clothes are advised for during the evenings and winter in mountainous areas. Rainwear is advisable as a precaution. Located 500km (300 miles) off the coast of Mozambique in the Indian Ocean, Madagascar is world’s fourth-largest island. Accompanied by several much smaller sibling isles, it is characterised by a central chain of high mountains, the Hauts Plateaux. This spiny ridge dominates the main island’s terrain and is a dividing line that marks Madagascar’s east-and-west differences in ethnicity, climate, and scenery. On the east coast, a skinny strip of lowlands, settled from the sixth century by Polynesian seafarers, is largely covered by dense rainforests. The broader west-coast landscape, once clad in dry deciduous forests, is now mostly grasslands. On both coasts, the climate is wetter towards the north although the east coast receives the monsoon. Semi-desert and forests of cactus-like scrub characterises the island’s southern tip with much of Madagascar’s flora and fauna is wholly unique. Busy capital city, Antananarivo, is situated high up in the Hauts Plateaux and almost denotes the island’s geographical centre."
africa,malawi,"Little Malawi is dwarfed by its much bigger southern African neighbours and this has undoubtedly affected both its tourism and its economy over the years. But thanks to a number of successful conservation and wildlife reintroduction programs, Malawi is fast developing a reputation as an up-and-coming safari destination, and tourists are slowly cottoning on to the wealth of other offerings to be found in the so-called warm heart of Africa. Malawi currently has nine national parks and wildlife reserves, six of which are especially recommended for visitors. There are also many attractive and accessible forest reserves. All the parks and reserves are uncrowded and give visitors an excellent experience of unspoiled wilderness. In 2012, lions were reintroduced into Majete Wildlife Reserve after a 30-year absence, which means Malawi is once again home to the Big 5 (lion, leopard, elephant, buffalo and rhino). As well as iconic African wildlife, Malawi also boasts diverse scenery, including deep valleys, evergreen forests and waterfalls, all presided over by the dramatic peaks of Mount Mulanje and the rugged and regal Zomba Plateau in the south. Outdoor activities are central to any visit to Malawi. You can trek, mountain bike or horse ride in entirely natural surroundings or climb peaks and plateaus. But the vast Lake Malawi remains the shimmering jewel in Malawi’s crown. Cut into the Great Rift Valley and stretching from the northern tip of the country to Mangochi in the south, Lake Malawi is Africa’s third largest lake. Some of the world’s rarest tropical fish are found here, not to mention myriad bird species. It’s a dream destination for twitching, scuba diving and kayaking, or simply relaxing by the beach. Though Malawi remains one of the poorest countries in Africa, unlike some its neighbours it is an inherently peaceful place. And what it lacks in economic capital, it more than makes up for with its natural riches and ubiquitous kindness. 118,484 sq km (45,747 sq miles). 17,749,826 (UN estimate 2016). 151.6 per sq km. Lilongwe. Republic. President Lazarus Chakwera since 2020. President Lazarus Chakwera since 2020.","The shores of Lake Malawi have been inhabited for thousands of years and recent archaeological excavations have revealed evidence of settlements dating back to the late Stone and Iron Ages. The majority of the present population descend from Bantu tribes, who arrived in the region some time before the first Arab slave traders and Portuguese explorers. British colonial settlers and missionaries, including David Livingstone, moved into the area in the late 1850s. Colonial domination became inevitable and, in 1891, the British declared the country the British Protectorate of Nyasaland. In 1953, the British federated Nyasaland with Northern and Southern Rhodesia (now Zambia and Zimbabwe), but Nyasaland seceded in 1963 following elections which gave Dr Hastings Banda a majority. In 1964, Nyasaland became independent as Malawi and, two years later, was declared a republic and a one-party state. In 1971, Dr Banda became President for Life, and during his subsequent reign retained a firm grip of the country, jailing or exiling opponents and attracting criticism for his support of South Africa’s apartheid regime. By 1993, the ailing Banda was forced to concede political pluralism in Malawi. After the adoption of a new constitution, simultaneous parliamentary and presidential elections were held in 1994. Banda and his chief henchman, the much-hated and feared John Tembo, were put on trial for their alleged role in the 1983 murders of four opposition politicians. They were acquitted in 1995, although investigations into various financial misdemeanours continued. The prosecution of Banda ended with his death in 1997, but Tembo was eventually convicted in 2003. Abroad, Malawi has aligned itself with the post-liberation government in South Africa, the main political and economic force in the region. Domestically, the HIV/AIDS pandemic has been the dominant issue: Malawi is one of the worst affected countries with an estimated one million people (just under 10% of the total population) living with the infection. Traditionally a very conservative society strongly influenced by Scottish missionaries during the colonial era, Malawi has found it hard to come to terms with its plight. Did you know? •	Blantyre, the second city, hosts an annual nsima eating contest. Winners can expect to pack away up to 3kg of the starch. •	Lake Malawi contains more fish species than any other lake. •	The lake is locally known as Lake Nyasa, which translates as ‘Lake Lake’. 80% are Christian, 13% Muslim. A recorded 4.3% of the remaining 7% have no religion (1998 census). Despite the large number of tribal backgrounds in the Malawi population, integration is well established and visitors need not be aware of any social differences. The white population is very small in number. There are some religious differences, most noticeable among the Muslim population and especially as far as alcohol consumption is concerned. Malawians place emphasis on the importance of shaking hands on meeting and departing. The special handshake, which includes grasping the thumb and putting the other hand on the forearm, is best avoided unless practised. Children and some women may curtsey as a greeting or if being made a presentation. Offering a soft drink to a visitor is common at meetings. Malawians tend to be conventional rather than casual in their dress, especially in formal gatherings. Modest dress should be worn unless at the beach or playing sport. English and Chichewa are both official. Chichewa is widely spoken but the language of the business community is English.","Varies from cool in the highlands to warm around Lake Malawi. Winter (May to July) is dry and nights can be chilly, particularly in the highlands. The rainy season runs from November to March. Around Lake Malawi, in winter, the climate is particularly dry with pleasant cooling breezes. Lightweights are worn all year in the Lake Malawi area, with warmerclothes advised in the mountains, particularly during winter and onchilly evenings elsewhere. Visitors to Nyika and Zomba should note thatthe nights can be cold. Dark or 'natural' coloured clothing should beworn for game viewing. Malawi shares borders to the north and northeast with Tanzania, to the south, east and southwest with Mozambique and to the west with Zambia. Lake Malawi, the third largest lake in Africa, is the dominant feature of the country, forming the eastern boundary with Tanzania and Mozambique. The scenery varies in the country's three regions. The Northern Region is mountainous, with the highest peaks reaching over 2,500m (8,200ft), and features the rolling Nyika Plateau, rugged escarpments, valleys and the thickly forested slopes of the Viphya Plateau. The Central Region is mainly a plateau, over 1,000m (3,300ft) high, with fine upland scenery. This is the country's main agricultural area. The Southern Region is mostly low-lying except for the 2,100m-high (6,890ft) Zomba Plateau south of Lake Malawi and the huge, isolated Mulanje Massif (3,000m/10,000ft) in the southeast. The variety of landscape and the wildlife it supports make this relatively unspoilt country particularly attractive to visitors."
africa,mali,"With a history blighted by political instability, it's hardly surprising that Mali is missing from most people’s bucket lists. But as peace slowly returns to this dusty land, travellers are trickling back to unearth the country’s cultural treasures – of which there are many. Though it’s hard to see how one of the most remote nations in the world, located deep within the Sahara Desert, ever became a centre of world learning, Timbuktu is not only a byword for long distances, but also an internationally recognised centre of knowledge: its libraries contain seminal notes on astronomy, mathematics and philosophy dating back to the 16th century. Closely linked to Timbuktu by the Saharan trade in gold, salt and slaves, Djenné is known the world over for its adobe architecture, in particular the Grand Mosque, a UNESCO World Heritage Site and the largest mud-brick building in the world. Bamako, Mali’s capital, may not have the cultural attractions of Timbuktu or Djenné, but it has a fascinating collection of architectural styles and an elegant location on the banks of the River Niger. What’s more, it is the centre of the country’s traditional music scene and Malians of all ethnicities throng to the nightclubs of Bamako to dance the night away to the sound of the kora, a lute-like instrument. The most distinct of Mali’s people are the Dogon, whose secluded, cliff-side villages cling to sheer rock faces. Deliberately isolating themselves from the influences of neighbouring tribes they have developed a culture with no similarity in the region. A land of faraway cities, intriguing civilisations and architecture like nowhere else on Earth, Mali’s position as a cultural juggernaut is well founded and its tentative steps towards stability have opened up an avenue of discovery for intrepid travellers. 1,240,192 sq km (478,841 sq miles). 18,134,835 (UN estimate 2016). 13.7 per sq km. Bamako. Republic. Transitional president: Assimi Goita since May 2021. Interim prime minister: Choguel Maïga since 2021.","Once one of the great centres of Islamic culture and wealth, Mali owes much of its reputation to its situation as a major trading centre and to the tax that is levied on its trans-Saharan route. The Ghana Empire was the first to rise in the region, expanding throughout West Africa between the 8th and 11th centuries. The second, the Mali Empire, reached its zenith in the early 14th century. After its decline, the territory became part of the Songhai Empire, which was brought to an end by a Moroccan invasion in 1591. With the decline of the trans-Saharan trading routes in salt, gold and slaves, the area enjoyed little strategic importance and was divided into small kingdoms for the next two centuries until the arrival of French colonists. Mali was absorbed into French West Africa in 1895. In 1960, together with what is now Senegal, it achieved independence as the Federation of Mali, although Senegal seceded after a few weeks. The first president was Modibo Keita, who severed ties with France and developed strong links with the USSR. In 1968, a military coup overthrew Keita and the coup leader promised a return to civilian rule. This failed to materialise until in 1991, army officer, Lieutenant-Colonel Amadou Toumani Touré, assumed power. In presidential elections later that year, the leader of the Alliance pour la Démocratie au Mali (ADEMA), Alpha Oumar Konaré, won and dominated Malian politics for the next 10 years. Konaré secured re-election in 1997 but the political environment was far from peaceful during the period of ADEMA rule. The country was beset by strikes, student protests, as well as a revolving door of prime ministers, few of whom lasted more than a year. In 2002, after a decade in the political wilderness, Touré returned to office. French approval quickly became evident when the bulk of Mali's debt to France was cancelled within months of the election. Touré won elections again in 2007, and democratic institutions continue to strengthen despite a Tuareg rebellion and French military intervention in 2012.

Mali is a landlocked republic, sharing borders with Mauritania, Algeria, Burkina Faso, Côte d'Ivoire, Guinea, Niger and Senegal. It is a vast land of flat plains fed by two major rivers, the Senegal on its western edge and the great River Niger. On its journey north the Niger converges with the River Bani, and forms a rich inland delta, the marshlands of the Macina, stretching for some 450km (280 miles) along the river's length, in some places 200km (124 miles) wide. The central part of the country is arid grazing land, called the Sahel, which has suffered great drought. At Timbuktu, the Niger reaches the desert and here it turns first to the east, then to the southeast at Bourem, where it heads for the ocean. In the desert, near the Algerian and Niger borders in the northeast, the Adrar des Iforas massif rises 800m (2,625ft). The north of the country is true desert except for the few oases along the ancient trans-Saharan camel routes. Tuaregs still live around these oases and camel routes. Further south live the Peulh cattle-raising nomads. The majority of the population lives in the savannah region in the south. The peoples of this region comprise Songhai, Malinke, Senoufou, Dogon and the Bambara (the largest ethnic group)."
africa,mauritania,"Mauritania’s is a lonely beauty. A land of endless deserts, empty coastlines and spectacular birdlife, it is lays claim to some of the most spectacular scenery in Africa and a fascinating population comprised of Arab-Berbers and black Africans. Arguably the jewel in Mauritania’s crown is the Banc d’Arguin, where the Sahara Desert slips silently into the Atlantic Ocean. This is nirvana for twitchers, particularly during the European winter, when more than two million migratory birds descend on the national park. The Banc d’Arguin is also home to the Imraguen fishermen, who catch their quarry with a little help from local dolphins. The Mauritanian coastline is a bleak and beautiful place, an empty shore littered with the occasional shipwreck or whale skeleton. Miraculously, one of the last remaining Mediterranean monk seal colonies can be found living around Cap Blanc, where there is a small nature reserve dedicated to protecting this endangered species. Inland lies the oasis settlement of Ouadâne. Concealed by coloured sand dunes, this ghost town was once a centre for intellectual thinking and its private libraries contain thousands of ancient scholarly manuscripts. It’s also home to the crumbling remains of a 14th century mosque, which dominates this UNESCO-listed town. Nearby Chinguetti, the seventh holiest city of Islam, is also worth a visit. Nouakchott, the capital, is hot and dusty and doesn’t have very much to recommend it besides a few French restaurants and bustling markets. The best thing to do in town is to watch local fishermen land their catch at Port de Peche, where every evening a colourful mass of people haul nets, carry fish and drag brightly painted boats out of the waves, singing songs as they go. It’s one of Mauritania’s many simple pleasures.   1,030,700 sq km (397,955 sq miles). 4,166,463 (UN estimate 2016). 3.5 per sq km. Nouakchott. Islamic Republic.

For over 500 years, to 1674 when the Arabs defeated them, the Almoravid Dynasty controlled the trade in gold, slaves and salt. French domination of the area was established in the late 19th century and until 1960 when Mauritania achieved independence. Since the 1970s, the country has been locked in dispute with its two northern neighbours, Algeria and Morocco, concerning the future of Western Sahara, a disputed territory ceded to Morocco and Mauritania by Spain in 1975. Mauritania's first post-independence ruler, Mukhtar Ould Daddah, was able to keep control of his poor, sparsely populated desert country only by playing his two powerful neighbours, Morocco and Algeria, off against one another. This didn't wash for long and he was duly deposed in a military coup in 1978. The dominant political figure in Mauritania for the last two decades has been Maaouiya Ould Sid'Ahmed Taya, a former army officer who first seized power in a military coup in 1984. In the early 1990s, Mauritania came under pressure to introduce representative civilian government. Elections for a presidency and a bicameral parliament were held the following year. Taya reinvented himself as a civilian politician and comfortably won the presidential race. He was elected for a third term in the hotly disputed presidential poll in November 2003. What followed was growing discontent over the government's often heavy-handed approach to political opposition, which mainly comes from the organised labour movement and Islamist organisations. Both are subject to periodic crackdowns. There are also tensions between black Mauritanians and those of Arab origin. In 2005, there was a largely bloodless coup in which a transitional government was appointed. A new constitution was passed in 2006 and elections held in 2007. These proved inconclusive and there was another coup in 2008. Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz, leader of the 2005 coup, was elected president in 2009. Did you know? • Mauritania’s coast is home to the so-called Dolphin Tribe, a fishing community that uses wild dolphins to help them haul in the day’s catch. • Mauritania boasts one of the longest trains in the world. Stretching up to 3km long (1.8miles), the train carries iron ore from Adrar to the coast. • In this country plagued by food shortages, to be fat is to be beautiful, wealthy and prestigious. Some girls under go a process of ‘fattening up’ to ensure they can make a good marriage. Islam is the official religion. Despite ethnic and cultural differences among Mauritanians, they are all bound by a common Muslim attachment to the Malekite sect. Islam has been the major influence in this country since the seventh and eighth centuries and visitors should respect the religious laws and customs. Dress for women should be uncompromisingly modest. Nearly all the population have traditionally been nomadic herdsmen. The bulk of the population is divided into two main Moorish groups, the Bidan (55%) and the Harattin (20%), with the non-Moorish population concentrated in the Senegal River area. Different classes and tribes tend to be contiguous. The official language is Arabic but French is widely spoken. The Moors of Arab/Berber stock, speaking Hassaniya dialects of Arabic, comprise the majority of the people. Other dialects include Soninke, Poular and Wolof. English is increasingly spoken.","Most of the country is hot and dry with practically no rain. In the south, however, rainfall is higher with a rainy season which runs from July to September.

Lightweight cottons and linens, with a warm wrap for cool evenings. Waterproofs are necessary for the rainy season. Mauritania is bordered by Algeria, Mali, Western Sahara (Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic) and Senegal. To the west lies the Atlantic Ocean. Mauritania consists mainly of the vast Saharan plain of sand and scrub. Most of this area is a sea of sand dunes, but in places the land rises to rocky plateaux with deep ravines leaving isolated peaks. The Adrar plateau in the central region rises to 500m (1,640ft), and the Tagant further south to 600m (1,970ft). The area is scattered with towns, small villages and oases. The northern bank of the Senegal River, which forms the country's southern border, is the only area in the country with any degree of permanent vegetation and it supports a wide variety of wildlife."
africa,mauritius,"A hypnotic blend of Indian, African and European influences, Mauritius might be synonymous with luxury beach breaks, but this destination will dazzle even the most discerning traveller, with its superb hiking, excellent mountain climbing and world-class diving. The beaches are, indeed, noteworthy of praise. Encircling the island, they are exactly what the holiday brochures promise. But beyond its celebrated sands, native forests grow over the cooler central plateau, providing a home to rare plants and animals such as the Mauritius flying fox, which can be found nowhere else on Earth. Back on the coast, a massive coral reef surrounds almost the entire island and has become a Mecca for divers thanks to its bountiful marine life. Hop out of the water and into local culture along the east coast, which is home to fine beaches and sleepy fishing communities. Village such as Petite Julie and Queen Victoria demonstrate the mixed Anglo-French heritage of the country, and it is in these sleepy outposts that you can hear sega music played in its most traditional form. The northern regions offer the best combination of beaches, cuisine and nightlife. Further west, the capital, Port Louis, is famed for its Caudan Waterfront complex of restaurants, shops and casinos, as well as the colonial-era central market and Places D’Armes. Dolphin safaris, rum distilleries and sand dunes add to the west’s appeal, though for many visitors the star attraction here is Le Morne mountain, which was used as a hideout by runaway slaves.

Sailors from Portugal were the first modern Europeans to set foot on the island, setting up a trading centre around 1510. It was finally colonised by a small Dutch force sailing into Grand Port in 1638. They named the island after Prince Maurice of Nassau, a member of the Dutch royal family, and sought to take advantage of what natural resources were available, including ebony and sugar cane. With the Dutch failing to make the colony a success, Mauritius was left uninhabited again in 1710, only to be re-colonised five years later by the French, who imported African slaves to work on the sugar plantations. Mauritius was captured by the British during the Napoleonic Wars (1803-1815), after Britain became tired of its commercial ships being attacked by vessels based there. It became part of the British Empire in 1814 while retaining many of its French influences including the language and law. After the abolition of slavery in the 1830s, Indian labourers were brought to the island, and their descendants now comprise more than two-thirds of the population, further contributing to today’s impressive ethnic diversity. Mauritius remained a British colony until 1957, when it was granted internal self-government with an electoral system based on the Westminster model. Queen Elizabeth II remained head of state. The first election based on the principles of adult universal suffrage was held in 1959, and won by the Labour Party. Despite being British for almost 150 years, French influence from the early 19th century continued to dominate the island’s culture. Full independence was granted in 1968, when the independence movement, led by Sir Seewoosagur Ramgoolam, finally triumphed, though Queen Elizabeth II remained head of state until 1992 when a presidential republic was declared. Post-independence Mauritian politics have been dominated by the Ramgoolam family (Navin Ramgoolam, the prime minister since 1995 is the son of Sir Seewoosagur) and by the two principal figures of the Mauritian Left, Paul Bérenger and Sir Anerood Jugnauth. Did you know? •	Boxer Bruno Julie gave the island its first Olympic medal at the Beijing Games in 2008. •	Because of its small size, Mauritius is the most densely populated country in Africa. •	Despite being extinct for 350 years, the Dodo is the island’s national bird. 52% Hindu, 31% Christian (mainly Roman Catholic), 15% Muslim and 2% other. Handshaking is the customary form of greeting. Visitors should respect the traditions of their hosts, particularly when visiting a private house. The type of hospitality the visitor receives is determined by the religion and social customs of the host, which are closely related. It is appropriate to give a gift as a small token of appreciation if invited for a meal. Dress is normally informal although men will need to wear a suit for particularly formal occasions. The two official languages of Mauritius are English and French (with French being the most dominant). The most commonly used languages on the street are Creole (pidgin French with other languages added to the mix), Hindi and Bhojpuri. Urdu and Chinese are also spoken. All people speak either some English or some French.","Mauritius has a tropical maritime climate, with relatively little seasonal variation in temperatures, and generally pleasant and sunny on the coast year round. Winter, from May to October is warm and dry. Summer from November to April is hot, humid and rainy. Cyclones occur between January and March. Sea breezes blow all year, especially on the east coast, and the inland central plateau around Curepipe is cooler and rainy year round. Tropical lightweights, with warmer wear for evenings and winter months. Rainwear advisable all year round. In the summer months, sun-care products and a hat are advisable and long sleeves and trousers to help prevent insect bites. Mauritius, a volcanic and mountainous island in the Indian Ocean, lies 2,000km (1,240 miles) off the south-eastern coast of Africa, due east of Madagascar. The island state stands on what was once a land bridge between Asia and Africa called the Mascarene Archipelago. From the coast, the land rises to form a broad fertile plain on which sugar cane flourishes and beyond, crater edges form a mountainous backbone. Some 500km (310 miles) east is Rodrigues Island, while northeast are the Cargados Carajos Shoals and 900km (560 miles) to the north is Agalega."
africa,morocco,"Known for its incredible cultural riches, Morocco has fascinated travellers for centuries. The name usually conjures up images of sprawling souks, walled medinas and towering minarets calling Muslims to prayer. Morocco's biggest drawing card is Marrakech (also spelt Marrakesh), a vibrant city that Winston Churchill once described as ""simply the nicest place on Earth to spend an afternoon."" This sentiment still rings true for many travellers today. But Morocco is more than just Marrakech. Tangier, in the north, sits just 13km (8mi) away from Gibraltar and is characterised by its whitewashed buildings and sandy beaches. Further down the Atlantic coast, you will soon come across Morocco's capital city Rabat, cosmopolitan Casablanca, atmospheric Essaouira, and the lively beach resort of Agadir, the latter is a firm favourite among sun-seekers and surfers. Inland, Fes (also spelt Fez) is a well-preserved medieval city famed for its high-walled medina. Talking about medinas, which essentially mean old walled towns, it is worth mentioning that the medinas of Essaouira, Fes, Marrakech and Tétouan are all on UNESCO's World Heritage list. Beyond the cities, awesome landscapes await. Like an elongated spine, the Atlas Mountains run from the southwest to the centre of Morocco, before extending eastward to Algeria and Tunisia. These rugged landscapes offer spectacular scenery from deep gorges, verdant valleys to snow-capped peaks. People come here to trek, bike, or scale Mount Toubkal, the highest peak in the Atlas Mountains. The areas are also home to the Berber people, whose unique culture, crafts and costumes make for a fascinating visit. While Morocco is generally a safe country to visit, travellers interested in the disputed territory of Western Sahara should seek the latest travel advice from their own government before departing. This sparsely-populated territory, which sits in the south of Morocco and northwest of Mauritania, is partly controlled by Morocco, a claim that the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR), whose government is in exile in Algeria, disagrees. The sovereignty issue remains a sensitive subject. 716,550 km sq (including disputed Western Sahara). 36.47 million (2020). 83 per km sq. Rabat. Constitutional monarchy. King Mohammed VI since 1999. Prime Minister Aziz Akhannouch since 2021.","Whether you're strolling through the narrow streets of a medina, shopping for spices in a busy souk, or following a tour guide up to a remote Berber village, you can't escape the power of Moroccan history and the unique influences from the Berber, Arab, African, and later Spanish and French. The indigenous Berber people are thought to have lived in Morocco, especially the Atlas Mountains range, for thousands of years. They survived through the Ancient Roman period and later a cycle of rising and falling Islamic dynasties. In 1884, Spain established a protectorate in coastal areas of Morocco and then the French came in 1912 and made Morocco their protectorate (while Spain was allowed to operate in Zones of influence in northern and southern Morocco). In 1956, Morocco gained its independence following unrest but Spain kept its two coastal enclaves – Ceuta and Melilla. Sultan Mohammed V was reinstalled; this means that the Alaouite dynasty, which has been reigning since 1666, continues to rule to this day. Did you know? • The Guinness World Records consider al-Qarawiyyin or Karueein University, founded in Fez in 859, to be the oldest in the world. • The world's largest swimming pool is in Casablanca. It is 480m (1,574 ft) long and 75 m (246 ft) wide, and has an area of 3.6ha (8.9acres). 99% of Morocco's population are Muslims (almost all Sunni Muslims). Jewish, Christians and other religions make up the other 1%. Morocco's culture is a blend of religious and ethnic traditions, encompassing Berber, Arab, African, Mediterranean, and Jewish influences. Greetings between men usually start with ""Salam Alaikum"" (peace be upon you) and may either involve a handshake or kisses on both cheeks, followed by friendly inquiries after health, happiness and family. Females may kiss on the cheeks, usually three times. Travellers should observe local courtesies. Men and women should not wear revealing clothing in public – beachwear, sleeveless tops, shorts, and clingy clothing are acceptable by the hotel pool but not in public places. Sexual relations outside marriage and homosexual conduct are punishable by law, yet Morocco has long been a destination favoured by LGBTQ+ travellers given its liberal reputation in the 1950s and 60s. While modern Moroccans are tolerant, displaying affection in public between same-sex couples is best avoided. Smoking is widespread, though prohibited in enclosed public spaces. Drinking alcohol in public isn’t allowed, and should be consumed discreetly indoors. The official languages are Arabic and Tamazight (which is a combination of three major Moroccan Berber languages). French is widely spoken, while English is understood in major tourist attractions.","Morocco's climate is very diverse, varying with the season and region. The climate is Mediterranean on the coasts, humid temperate at higher elevations, and hot and dry in the south-western part. Coastal cities in the north – Tangier, Rabat and Casablanca – all have a similar Mediterranean climate with hot and dry summers and relatively warm and wet winters. In Casablanca, August is often the hottest month with an average high of 30°C (86°F) and maybe 10mm (0.4in) of rain. January is slightly cooler, with an average high of 18°C (64°F). Rainfall is abundant from November to March. The best time to visit these coastal cities is from May to September as the period is warm and dry. Marrakech, which lies inland in the Tensift River valley, has a subtropical semi-desert with very hot summers and warm winters. Temperatures do fluctuate significantly between day and night. For more information, see the weather in Marrakech and the best time to go guide. The Atlas Mountains are popular from March to November, although the scorching heat between June and August may make travelling uncomfortable. Lightweight cottons and linens are best worn during summer, with a jacket for cooler evenings. In winter, pack light to medium-weight clothing. Waterproof gear may also be needed, depending on where and when you are going. Men and women should not wear revealing clothing in public – beachwear, sleeveless tops, shorts, and clingy clothing are acceptable by the hotel pool but not in public places. Morocco is located on the westernmost tip of north Africa, bordering the North Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea. It sits just 13km (8mi) away from Gibraltar and shares land borders with Algeria and the disputed territory Western Sahara, which is in the south. The interior of Morocco is mountainous. Like an elongated spine, the Atlas Mountains run from the southwest to the centre of Morocco, before extending eastward to Algeria and Tunisia, while the Rif Mountains run along the north coast. Often snow-covered in winter, Morocco's mountains are home to the country's significant indigenous Berber population, whose unique culture, crafts and costumes make for a fascinating visit. The long stretch of the Atlantic coast down Morocco's western side features a few vibrant cities – among them Tangier, Rabat, Casablanca, Essaouira and Agadir. The coastal part is separated from the mountainous region by wide swathes of fertile plains. The Sahara – Africa's largest desert – stretches its toes into southern Morocco. Far from being featureless, it is dotted with palm-fringed oases and traditional villages."
africa,mozambique,"Mozambique’s messy post-colonial history and poor infrastructure mean that most visitors are cut from fairly intrepid cloth. But travelling this enigmatic and underexplored country is well worth the occasional bump in the road, both literal and metaphorical. First and foremost amongst the country’s many attractions is its pristine Indian Ocean coastline – all 2,414km (1,500 miles) of it – which offers palm-fringed beaches, warm tropical waters, abundant marine life, great fishing, excellent diving, fantastic snorkeling and a number of idyllic islands from which you can enjoy all of the above in sweet isolation. And then there are the parks. Though much of the country’s big game was wiped out during the desperate days of the Mozambican Civil War (1977-1992), sterling conservation efforts have seen several national parks restored to something like their former glory. Their remoteness and relative inaccessibility, compared to the parks in neighbouring South Africa, mean you’ll never be jostling for space with the masses. Mozambique’s Portuguese heritage and faded art deco charm characterises much of the capital, Maputo, in the form of colourful, crumbling and sometimes bullet-ridden colonial buildings, which stand in stark contrast to the more modern parts of this vibrant port city. The music, the nightlife and the food are equally interesting and eclectic; head to the bustling fish market to enjoy what many locals will tell you is the best seafood in East Africa. There is also good hiking with little-visited mountains dotted throughout the Mozambican hinterland, but extreme caution should be taken due to the large amount of leftover landmines. Since peace returned to the country in 1992, Mozambique has been trying to piece itself back together and realise its substantial tourism potential. But for now, a large part of the country’s appeal lies in its relative obscurity from the more beaten paths of Southern Africa. 799,380 sq km (308,642 sq miles). 28,751,362 (UN estimate 2016). 31.7 per sq km. Maputo. Republic. President Filipe Nyusi since 2015. Prime Minister Adriano Maleiane since 2022.","Bantu tribes moved into an area, part of which is now Mozambique, from central and western Africa during the third century. The 11th-century Shona Empire, the main ethnic group in modern Zimbabwe, covered part of Mozambique and relations between the two peoples are still very close. Mozambique attracted the attention of Arab and Indian traders in the 10th century. The first European expedition to Mozambique was led by the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama, who arrived in 1498. Thereafter, Portuguese influence gradually displaced the Arabs and Indians. The Portuguese colonialists gradually moved inland, usurping the local rulers and taking over land and mineral resources. By the 18th century, they had developed Mozambique into a major centre for the slave trade, which continued to thrive for decades after its official banning in 1842. Mozambique continued as a Portuguese colony until 1951 when it became an overseas province. The economy expanded rapidly during the 1950s and early 1960s, attracting thousands of Portuguese settlers to the country. It was around this time that the first nationalist groups began to form. The main nationalist movement, FRELIMO, began a guerrilla war, which ended in 1974 following a military coup in Portugal. The new left-wing government in Lisbon had no wish to maintain an empire and independence negotiations began immediately. Mozambique became independent in 1975, and FRELIMO took power in a one-party state. Then a 16-year-long civil war ensued. The National Resistance Movement (RENAMO), set up by the white-run Rhodesian government and then backed by apartheid South Africa and the US, fought a guerrilla war against FRELIMO from 1976 until the a ceasefire was brokered in 1992. Elections were held in 1994 and won by FRELIMO. The new government was confronted with hundreds of thousands of refugees, as well as large numbers of demobilised soldiers from both sides, massive social and economic dislocation, and the destruction of virtually all health and education services. Despite some setbacks, the Chissano government made steady progress in tackling these problems during the late 1990s, and in 1999 FRELIMO prevailed once again with Armando Guebuza becoming president. In the 2015 election, he was succeeded by Filipe Nyusi, also from FRELIMO. Did you know? • Apparently the name of the country arose from Musa al Big the name of an Arab who was living on Ilha de Mozabique when the Portuguese arrived. • Over 22 years, more than 170,000 landmines were cleared from Mozambique. In some places specially trained rats were used to locate the mines. The country was declared free of the deadly weapons in 2015. • Mozambique is home to five of the seven endangered species of sea turtles. Christian (mainly Roman Catholic), Muslim and Hindu. Many also follow traditional beliefs. Shaking hands is the customary form of greeting. Casual wear is acceptable. Formal dress is seldom required. Photography: Visitors should not take photographs of soldiers, airports, bridges or government/public buildings. Only photos of beaches and other tourist sites may be taken. Portuguese is the official language. Many local African languages, such as Tsonga, Sena Nyanja, Makonde and Macua, are also spoken.","Climate varies according to area. Inland is cooler than the coast and rainfall higher as the land rises, with most rain between January and March. Hottest and wettest season is October to March. From April to September the coast has warm, mainly dry weather tempered by sea breezes. Tropical lightweights, with warmer clothing for evenings. Rainwear advisable all year round. Mozambique borders Tanzania to the north, Zambia and Malawi to the northwest, Zimbabwe to the west, and South Africa and Swaziland to the southwest. To the east lies the Indian Ocean and a coastline of nearly 2,500km (1,550 miles) with beaches bordered by lagoons, coral reefs and strings of islands. Behind the coastline, a vast low plateau rising towards mountains in the west and north accounts for nearly half the area of Mozambique. The landscape of the plateau is savannah - more or less dry and open woodlands with tracts of short grass steppe. The western and northern highlands are patched with forest. The Zambezi is the largest and most important of the 25 main rivers which flow through Mozambique into the Indian Ocean. The major concentrations of population (comprising many different ethnic groups) are along the coast and in the fertile and relatively productive river valleys, notably in Zambezia and Gaza provinces. The Makua-Lomwe, who belong to the Central Bantu, live mainly in the area north of Zambezia, Nampula, Niassa and Cabo Delgado provinces. The Tsonga, who are the predominant race in the southern lowlands, provide a great deal of the labour for the South African mines. In the Inhambane coastal district are the Chopi and Tsonga, while in the central area are the Shona. The Makonde inhabit the far north. Mestizos and Asians live in the main populated area along the coast and in the more fertile river valleys."
africa,namibia,"From the seemingly endless sand dunes of the Namib Desert to the tropical wetlands of the Caprivi Strip, Namibia is a country of epic landscapes, bountiful wildlife and few people. Its greatest assets are the rugged Namib and Kalahari deserts, which support a surprising diversity of fauna including rare black rhinos, cheetahs, and vast groups of gemsbok, zebra and ostrich. Parts of Namibia can be harsh and unforgiving, and nowhere is this more evident than along the Skeleton Coast. Shrouded in thick fog, lashed by Atlantic waves, occupied by shifting dunes, and littered with rusting carcasses of ships ran aground on its shores, this area certainly makes travellers feel like they are far removed from civilisation. Away from the dreamscape of sand and rock, the wildlife-rich Etosha National Park is another must-see. During the dry season, herds of wildebeest and dazzles of zebras congregate at waterholes scattered around the park, while predators wait patiently for a chance to pounce – the dramatic scenes of pursuit offer unforgettable experiences. Other worth-noting national parks are Ai-Ais in the south and Khaudum in the northeast. The former is home to the Fish River Canyon, Africa's largest canyon, while the latter welcomes more elephants than people to the park. Namibia's capital is Windhoek, a vibrant, modern city perching on the Khomas Highland in central Namibia. Its colonial architecture, thriving culinary scene and excellent beer make it a pleasant place to while away a few days. On the whole, Namibia is delightfully wild and unspoilt, offering plenty of off-the-beaten-track destinations for travellers to experience the ultimate safari adventure, capture stunning landscape shots, and above all, find quiet and solitude. 824,292 sq km (318,261 sq miles). 2,494,530 (2021). 3 per sq km. Windhoek. Republic. President Nangolo Mbumba since 2024. Prime Minister Saara Kuugongelwa-Amadhila since 2015.","From the rock paintings in the Twyfelfontein, anthropologists can tell us that Namibia's prehistory dates back more than 25,000 years when the first settlers moved to the area. Subsequently, a long and resilient lineage of various ethnic groups, from the San (Bushmen), Nama, Damara, Bantu, to the more recent Herero and Oorlams have been making this mostly barren land home. Although Europeans had known about Namibia since 1486 when Portuguese Captain Diago Cão sailed along the South Atlantic coast, it wasn't until 1793 that Dutch settlers from Cape Colony (now South Africa) began to take an interest in Walvis Bay due to its natural deep-water harbour. Then came German settlers and they proclaimed Namibia, then known as South West Africa, as a German protectorate in 1884. The German conquest wasn't plain sailing, however. From 1904 to 1907, the Herero people fought against German colonial troops but they lost dearly – historians believed that the war resulted in the death of 75% of the Herero population and 50% of the Nama population, making this genocide one of the darkest periods in Namibia's history. In 1915, South Africa launched an attack and eventually captured South West Africa. Although South Africa became a sovereign independent state in 1934 and gained its full independence in 1961, Namibia did not as South Africa continued to tighten its grip on Namibia, leading to uprisings and the eventual formation of SWAPO (South West African Peoples Organisation). During this period, the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution that South West Africa be renamed Namibia in June 1968, following the wishes of its people. SWAPO spent the next few decades battling to rid Namibia of the South African occupiers. In 1988, South Africa finally agreed to hand control of Namibia to the United Nations. A year later, the UN Transitional Assistance Group (UNTAG) supervised an election that resulted in SWAPO coming to power, after 106 years of colonialism and a protracted struggle for national liberation. On 21 March 1990, Namibia attained its hard-won independence. Did you know? • The literacy rate in Namibia is about 92%, one of the highest in Africa. • Namibia is one of the least populated countries in the world. • The Namib Desert is believed to be 80 million years old, making it the oldest desert in the world. Christians make up 91% of the Namibian population, of which 78% are Protestants. Sunni Muslims and Bahai followers make up 1% altogether, while the rest hold indigenous beliefs. Namibians are friendly, polite people. Some Christians in rural places can be conservative, like they may refrain from public displays of affection and consider homosexuality taboo. Interestingly though, homosexuality is legal in Namibia. Usual courtesies like handshakes and greetings should be practised when meeting new people or visiting someone's home. When food and drink are offered, it is polite to accept. When visiting indigenous communities (like San, Nama, Ovahimba, Ovazemba, Ovatjimba and Ovatwa), visitors should follow the advice of a local guide. English is Namibia's official language but Oshiwambo dialects are the most widely spoken. Afrikaans and German are also spoken among the white population.","Namibia has a sub-tropical climate with most of the country enjoying a staggering 300 days of sunshine a year, making it a year-round destination. Along the coast, the cold Benguela Current keeps the area cool and rain-free year-round, but the air can be humid and when the water vapour condenses, dense fogs are formed, especially in early mornings, lending a mysterious edge to the area. In winter (July to September), temperatures along the coast can increase a few degrees when a hot dry wind (known as Berg Wind or Oosweer) blows from the inland to the coast. In the coastal town of Swakopmund, average highs range from 20°C (68°F) in July to 28°C (82°F) in February. Windhoek, Namibia's capital, perches at 1,700m (5,600ft) above sea level in the Khomas Highland plateau, almost exactly at the country's geographical centre. The official climate classification of Windhoek is semi-arid, meaning rainfall is infrequent, although the period between January to March sees an average of 80mm (3in) of rain each month. July is the coolest month with an average high of 21°C (70°F) and an average low of 7°C (45°F). On the other hand, January is the hottest month with an average high of 31°C (88°F) and an average low of 18°C (64°F). The Caprivi Strip has a unique tropical climate, with heavy rainfall that often leads to flooding between November and April. The wet season is a prime time for birdwatching as many migrating birds are present. On the contrary, June to September is dry, so animals tend to gather around waterholes and rivers to quench their thirst, making it an excellent time for game spotting. The Fish River Canyon, the largest canyon in Africa, lies in the south of Namibia. The highlight here is a five-day 90km (56mi) hiking trail along the canyon floor to the Ai-Ais Hot Springs, which you can only hike from mid-April to mid-September. The best time to visit Namibia depends on your activities. For travellers who prefer to avoid the intense heat of high summer (December to March), travelling during the winter months (May to August) is a good option. Birdwatchers may prefer to visit the Caprivi Strip between November to April, while the best time for safari-goers is from June to September. Light cottons and linens are best, with a jacket for cooler evenings. Sun hats, sunglasses, and sunscreen are essential. Neutral colours are recommended for safaris and game viewing, while ankle-height boots are recommended for hikers as there are poisonous snakes in the desert. Insect repellent is also useful during the rainy season or if you are visiting the Caprivi Strip. Namibia is a large, mostly arid country in southwest Africa. It borders Angola to the north, Botswana to the east, and South Africa to the south. In the northeast corner, the Caprivi Strip is a narrow panhandle of tropical Namibian territory juts towards Victoria Falls in Zambia. To the west is a 1,572km (977mi) long stretch of coastline, with the northern section shrouded in fog and littered with shipwrecks. The Namib, believed to be the world's oldest desert, runs along the coast of Namibia. The northern part of it lies the famous Skeleton Coast, an area where ships have run aground in thick fog that hovers below hot, dry air. To the south of the Skeleton Coast sits the Namib-Naukluft National Park, Namibia's largest conservation area, home to desert-adapted wildlife – including chacma baboons that can go for two weeks without drinking water and the Welwitschia plants that live for more than a thousand years in this harsh environment."
africa,niger,"One of the world’s poorest nations, Niger might be a challenging destination to travel around, but rewards abound for those willing to persevere. And with political stability returning to this West African nation, it is slowly opening up to tourists. A country shaped by Saharan trade routes, visitors came and went through this land for centuries, leaving behind them a wonderful fusion of Arab and African traditions. Agadez and Zinder sprung up along these now defunct routes and today these cities retain their ancient mercantile charm. Comprised of beautiful adobe dwellings, their labyrinthine streets are home to bustling markets, which sell pottery, leather and other decorative pieces. Zinder is also renowned for its extravagant Ramadan festival, during which horsemen can be seen riding through the streets in the most flamboyant fashion. Unlike Agadez and Zinder, Niger’s capital, Niamey, was never a site of trans-Saharan trade, and remained relatively unimportant until the 20th century. It continues to be possibly the least-hurried and most relaxed capital in the region. Situated on the lush banks of the Niger River, from which the country takes its name, Niamey is the commercial centre and a great place to delve into local life. Niger’s biggest cultural event, however, occurs out in the desert town of Ingall. At the end of the rainy season the town’s population of 500 swells to several thousand as Tuareg and Wodaabe nomads attend the annual Cure Salée festival. The centrepiece is the Wodaabe gerewol, during which unmarried men adopt extravagant makeup and sing rhythmic chants in the hope of impressing a future bride. Naturalists are also well catered for in Niger, which is home to a number of national parks, most famously W Regional Park, a haven for lions, leopards, elephants, baboons and much more. Ultimately, though, it’s Niger’s ancient cities, time-honoured festivals and nomadic culture that make this friendly country so beguiling. 1,267,000 sq km (489,191 sq miles). 20,715,285 (UN estimate 2016). 14.2 per sq km.

Prime Minister Ali Lamine Zène since 2023.","Human settlement in Niger goes back 6,000 years, when what was a very fertile area supported a well-developed civilisation. In the thousand years up to the 19th century, power in the region was based on control of the great trans-Saharan trade routes, with the Hausa Kingdom dominating the area from the 13th century. This power decreased from the 18th century, as European traders reached West Africa by sea. Colonised in the late 19th century, Niger was part of the French Empire until independence in 1960. Hamani Diori was elected the first head of state, and presided over a period of stability until severe drought in 1968 instigated widespread civil unrest. In April 1974, the army staged a coup under Seyni Kountché. A series of failed coups followed, but Kountché held on until his death in 1987. He was replaced by his staunch ally, Ali Saibou. Saibou’s Mouvement Nationale pour une Société de Développement (MNSD) became the sole political party until the early 1990s, when Niger came under increasing pressure to reintroduce democracy. A National Assembly poll held in 1993 saw victory for the Alliance des Forces de Changement (AFC). The MNSD was also thwarted in the presidential election, which was won by Mahamane Ousmane of the AFC. Following legislative elections in 1995, the MNSD recovered control of the national assembly under Cissé. Over the next year, friction between Cissé and Ousmane worsened until the military stepped in once again. Army chief of staff Ibrahim Bare Mainassara took control, but quickly restored a veneer of civilian government. In April 1999, Mainassara was killed by his head of security. The uncertain political situation which followed was resolved with the holding of simultaneous presidential and legislative elections. The MNSD recovered control of both presidency and national assembly, where it forms the government with Hana Amadou as premier. The sixth republic was formed in 2009 after constitutional changes to allow then president Mamadou Tandja to extent his tenure, before unrest lead to a further coup which returned the country to elections judged free and fair by the international community.

Niger has borders with Libya and Algeria to the north, Chad to the east, Nigeria and Benin to the south, and Mali and Burkina Faso to the west. The capital, Niamey, stands on the north bank of the Niger River and has long been a major trading centre on this important navigable waterway. The river meanders for 500km (300 miles) through the southwestern corner of the country. To the east is a band of semi-arid bush country along the border with Nigeria, shrinking by 20km (12 miles) every year as over-grazing claims more land for the Ténéré Desert, which already occupies over half of Niger. This desert is divided by a range of low mountains, Aïr ou Azbine, in the eastern foothills of which lies the city of Agadez. Surrounded by green valleys and hot springs amid semi-desert, this regional capital is still a major terminus for Saharan caravans. The desert to the west of the mountains is a stony plain hosting seasonal pastures; to the north and west are mostly vast expanses of sand. There is arable land beside Lake Chad in the extreme southeastern corner of the country. The Hausa people live along the border with Nigeria and most are farmers. The Songhai and Djerma people live in the Niger valley and exist by farming and fishing. The nomadic Fulani have spread all over the Sahel. The robed and veiled Tuaregs once dominated the southern cities; the few who remain are camel herders and caravanners on the Saharan routes.

africa,nigeria,"From the loud laughter of traffic-choked Lagos to the green-fringed villages that line rivers and streams, Nigeria is one of the most exciting places to visit in Africa. Once known only for oil and chaos, the country is changing rapidly. It has a rising middle class, a dynamic arts scene and more miles of golden sand than you can shake a bucket and spade at. Its national parks are home to some of the last remaining endangered species in West Africa, while its mountains offer a cooler climate and spectacular views of the most populous country in Africa. Those 177 million people are as diverse as the nation itself; in the north, you'll see men in colourful Muslim dress lining prayer mats on Fridays, while their southern counterparts play checkers before church. The cuisine too is varied; there are hot and spicy dishes, fresh fish and meat, fast food and imported fare. But Nigeria's greatest asset – its wealth of native races and religions, its vibrant population – have also proven its downfall on countless explosive occasions, and military overthrows, coups and assassinations have been numerous. The situation is particularly fraught in northern Nigeria, which is home to the jihadist group, Boko Haram (meaning “Western education is forbidden”). For all its domestic difficulties, Nigeria remains a major regional power and lays claim to the biggest economy in Africa – if you want to feel the excitement of an emerging country, this land will blow you away. It’s full of surprises, too. Visitors can find themselves dancing the night away at a Nigerian wedding party, sipping champagne with supermodels, haggling for art in Lagos’ hipster district, Yabi, and swimming beneath cascading waterfalls in the mountains. Though Nigeria is a loud and brash destination, it also has a quieter, more reflective side that deserves to be seen. In fact it has so many faces that at times it feels more like a continent than a country. 923,768 sq km (356,669 sq miles). 181,526,056 (UN estimate 2016) 204.2 per sq km. Abuja. Republic.

In the 15th century, the Portuguese began trading but, by the end of the 19th century, the British had conquered present-day Nigeria. Full independence was achieved in 1960, but ever since the country has endured numerous changes of government and Nigeria's army has chosen to intervene on several occasions to thwart a perceived threat. The greatest crisis came about in the mid-1960s, when the eastern part of the country – styling itself the Republic of Biafra – attempted to secede. A three-year civil war followed at the end of which the secessionists were defeated and up to 30,000 people of Ibo origin were dead. General Murtala Mohammed overthrew the government in 1974 but was assassinated in 1976 and replaced by army chief of staff General Olusegun Obasanjo. A series of coups and attempted coups followed, until elections in 1993 were won by Moshood Abiola, a former publisher who had been put up as a purely token opposition candidate. The military annulled the elections and returned the country to military rule. Sani Abacha emerged as the new military strongman and, over the next five years, presided over an increasingly oppressive regime that attracted particular criticism for its treatment of the Ogoni people. After their leader, the renowned writer Ken Saro-Wiwa, was executed along with eight colleagues Abacha suffered increasing diplomatic isolation, including from Nelson Mandela. Obasanjo returned to power in elections after Abacha's death in 1998 and faced the task of dealing with growing religious conflict that continues to this day. Several northern states adopted strict sharia law in 2000 and in 2002 more than 200 were killed after Muslim outrage over the planned Miss World beauty pageant in Kaduna. After 2007 oil production began to soar although clashes between Muslims and Christians intensified as Goodluck Jonathan was elected president in 2010, with a spate of deadly Christmas Day attacks killing at least 40 in 2010. Boko Haram militants claimed responsibility for the deaths of thousands in the next few years, and a state of emergency was declared in three northern states in 2013. The attacks continued into 2014, when Nigeria overtook South Africa as Africa's biggest economy. Did you know? • In the 2014 ebola outbreak Nigeria was the first country to eliminate the threat. • Nigeria is Africa’s most populous country. • Fela Kuti, perhaps the best known musician to emerge from Nigeria, is widely credited with pioneering the fusion of local styles with American jazz and soul to produce Afrobeat. 50% Muslim (mainly in the north and west of the country), 40% Christian (mostly in the south) and 10% traditional beliefs. Shaking hands with everyone is customary on meeting and departing. In Yorubaland, it is a sign of respect for women to curtsey when introduced and to enquire after relations, even if this is a first meeting. Unless the visitor knows someone well, it is unusual to be invited to a Nigerian's home. Most entertaining, particularly in Lagos, takes place in clubs or restaurants. A small gift of appreciation is always welcome and business souvenirs bearing the company logo are also acceptable. Casual wear is suitable and a lightweight suit and tie are only necessary for businesspeople on formal meetings; on most other occasions men will not need to wear a jacket, although a tie might be expected. Women should dress modestly, and respect local customs regarding dress, particularly in the Muslim north. It is inadvisable for women to wear trousers. There are over 250 tribes in Nigeria, the principal groups being the Hausa in the north, the Ibo (or Igbo) in the southeast and the Yoruba in the southwest. The larger of the minor groups are the Fulani, Idoma, Igala, Igbirra, Kanuri, Tiv and Nupe in the north; the Efik, Ekoi, Ibibio and Ijaw in the east; and the Edo, Itsekiri, Ijaw and Urhobo in the west. A result of this ethnic variety is the diversity of art, dance forms, language, music, customs and crafts. Nigerians have a very strong sense of ethnic allegiance. The official language is English. A variation of English (Pidgin English) is also spoken. The three main Nigerian languages are Yoruba, Ibo (also spelt Igbo) and Hausa; another 400 languages are also spoken in the country.","Varies from area to area. The southern coast is hot and humid with a rainy season from March to November. During the dry season, the Harmattan wind blows from the Sahara. The north's rainy season is from July to September. Nights can be cold in December and January. Lightweight cottons and linens are worn, with a warm wrap advisable in the north. Rainwear is essential during the rainy season. Nigeria has borders with Niger to the north, Chad (across Lake Chad) to the northeast, Cameroon to the east and Benin to the west. To the south, the Gulf of Guinea is indented by the Bight of Benin and the Bight of Biafra. The country's topography and vegetation vary considerably. The coastal region is a low-lying area of lagoons, sandy beaches and mangrove swamps, which merges into an area of rainforest where palm trees grow to over 30m (100ft). From here, the landscape changes to savannah and open woodland, rising to the Central Jos Plateau at 1,800m (6,000ft). The northern part of the country is desert and semi-desert, marking the southern extent of the Sahara."
africa,republic-of-congo,"Bordered to the East by the vast Congo River, the Republic of Congo is often confused with its bigger and more notorious sibling, the DRC, on the other side of the river, and this certainly hasn’t done its tourist reputation any favours in recent years. But for those intrepid enough to give the smaller, quieter and lesser-known Congo a try, they’ll find that it boasts beautiful landscapes characterised by undulating virgin rainforest, waterfalls, lagoons, river rapids and swamps. These wild places are home to an abundance of interesting flora and fauna, most notably rare primate species such as mountain gorillas and chimpanzees. While these iconic primates are the main attraction for the handful of tourists now trickling into the country, the forest is also home to several indigenous tribes, which have maintained their traditional way of life, almost entirely removed from Western civilization. Standing in stark contrast to most of the rest of the country, Congo’s fast-growing capital, Brazzaville, is a fascinating metropolis. Looking across the Congo River to the dilapidated sprawl of Kinshasa, the DRC capital, Brazzaville is by far the prettier and more appealing of the two cities, with a burgeoning arts scene, good food, vibrant nightlife, an interesting colonial heritage and welcoming locals. Since it gained its independence from the French in 1960, the Republic of Congo has been plagued by sporadic but severe bouts of civil war and ethnic conflict, the most bloody of which followed disputed parliamentary elections in 1993 and reached its pinnacle in 1997, fuelled in part by the prize of the country's substantial offshore oil wealth, which motivated many of the warlords. A peace accord was finally signed in 2003 and since then the country has slowly but surely been reimagining itself as a peaceful destination that is no longer defined by its torrid history, and one that deserves to be noticed and appreciated. 342,000 sq km (132,046 sq miles). 4,740,992 (UN estimate 2016). 13.9 per sq km.

The region later became a major centre for the European slave trade. In 1882 the territory was occupied by France, then absorbed into French Equatorial Africa in 1910. In 1958, the territory became an autonomous republic within the French community before being granted full independence as a republic in August 1960. Abbé Fulbert Youlou, a Catholic priest, was elected President and guided the Congo into a single-party state. A series of left-wing military governments followed until elections for the Presidency were held in 1979, and brought Colonel Denis Sassou-Nguesso to power. In November 1989, the Government introduced free-market policies, promoting private enterprise and conducting several privatisations. The political reform process began in 1991 with a national conference to discuss the future of the country. This agreed to establish a Higher Council of the Republic, abolishing the principal organs of state and with a brief to prepare legislative and presidential elections for the following year. These took place in the summer of 1992, bringing to power the Union Panafricaine pour la Démocratie Sociale (UPADS) as the major party in both the National Assembly and the Senate, while its leader, Pascal Lissouba, won the presidential poll. Following the disputed elections, the country descended into a bloody civil war that culminated in 1997 after Sassou-Nguesso’s rebel troops took the capital and reinstalled their leader as President. Under the banner of United Democratic Forces, Sassou-Ngessou stood at the 2002 presidential election, securing 90% of the vote amid widespread claims of vote rigging. Kignomba Mbougou, standing for UPADS (Lissouba's party) gained just 3%. By 2003, the country was largely at peace, though sporadic violence between government troops and the Ninjas rebel group continued in the Pool region until the group disbanded in 2008. Sassou-Nguesso was re-elected in the 2009 presidential election with 78.61% of the vote amidst an opposition boycott. He has recently made clear his intentions to change the country’s constitution to allow him to stand for a third consecutive term in 2016, a move that has been met by angry protests from opposition parties and the public. Did you know? • The entire population of Republic of Congo, roughly four million, is less than half of the DRC’s capital Kinshasa. • During the World War II, Brazzaville was the capital of the French resistance in Africa. • Congo is one of Africa’s biggest oil producers, but petrol shortages are a regular occurrence in the country.

africa,rwanda,"Dubbed 'The Land of a Thousand Hills', Rwanda's lush green landscape, and the diverse wildlife that inhabits it, is indeed the country's star attraction. This small, landlocked nation in East Africa has been pulling in an increasing number of in-the-know international tourists over the last decade. But back in 1994, few would have thought that the country could bounce back from the horrifying Rwanda genocide, where an estimated 800,000 Rwandans were tragically slaughtered by Hutu extremists (an ethnic group indigenous to the region). It was one of the darkest days in modern African history. But rebound it has. Today, Rwanda is known for its progressive policies just as much as its regretful history. The country is a role model in gender equality (Rwanda's government has had the highest percentage of female members throughout the 21st century) and conservation (notably enforcing a country-wide ban on plastic bags in 2008). Similarly, the country is a pioneer in ecotourism, with the creation of cycle lanes, wetland regions and sustainable wildlife tours, the standout of which is to see a troop of mountain gorillas in the thick forests of Volcanoes National Park on the country's northern border. In fact, Volcanoes National Park was where Dian Fossey, the world's leading authority on mountain gorillas, spent many years studying the endangered species. In 1983, she published the highly acclaimed Gorillas in the Mist, which was later made into a film. It's not all about gorillas, though. Nyungwe National Park, in the south of the country, is one of the largest remaining rainforests in Africa and is home to 13 species of primates, including chimpanzees and colobus monkeys, while Akagera National Park, in eastern Rwanda, offers up opportunities to spot rhinos, lions and hippos. And although Rwanda is landlocked, Lake Kivu covers a large portion of its western border with the Democratic Republic of the Congo, offering sandy beaches and warm waters for visitors to soak up the coastal vibe. It's also worth spending a few days in the capital, Kigali. Established in 1907, Kigali has grown exponentially after becoming Rwanda's capital in 1962. The city is colourful and vibrant, with lively markets and bustling restaurants abound. It is also clean and safe. To many visitors, Kigali offers cosmopolitan fun that complements Rwanda's rural attractions. Indeed, the past of Rwanda may be bleak, but the future certainly looks bright for Rwanda. 26,338 sq km (10,169 sq miles). 12.3 million (2018) 499 per sq km (2018) Kigali Republic. President Paul Kagame since 2000. Prime Minister Édouard Ngirente since 2017.","To set Rwanda's more recent history in context, you need to go as far back as the late 13th century when pastoral Tutsi tribes arrived from the south and conquered the Hutu and Twa inhabitants of Rwanda, establishing a feudal kingdom. A unified state was established by King Kigeri Rwabuguri during the 19th century, but this lasted only until 1890 when Rwanda was annexed as a province of German East Africa. When the Belgians came in 1916 (after what turned out to be a brief occupation by Germany), they embarked on an aggressive campaign to divide the population into three different groups. In an act that helped sow the seeds of genocide, the Belgians sponsored the dominance of the Tutsi minority at the expense of the Hutu, but were forced, in the 1960s, to concede independence under majority Hutu rule. Violence between Hutus and Tutsis started to flare up, culminating in the Rwandan Genocide of 1994: a 100-day period of carnage during which some 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus were murdered, while the international community looked on. Today, peace prevails in Rwanda. While the genocide cannot be forgotten (obvious by the number of memorials scattered around the country), there have been efforts to heal divides, with talk of ethnicity outlawed. This period of calm has helped Rwanda grow into one of Africa's most progressive nations. Throughout the 21st century, there has been a higher percentage of women in parliament in Rwanda than any other county on Earth, and the country has implemented a number of pioneering conservation initiatives, including the banning of plastic bags in 2008. In the last decade tourist numbers have drastically risen, bolstering Rwanda's growing economy further. At the same time, the government has embarked on a campaign to improve infrastructure: roads have been resurfaced, an ambitious large-scale railway project is in the works, and a 10,000-seat Kigali Arena was inaugurated in 2019 – developments that, it is hoped, will help in the forging of a new, positive identity for modern Rwanda. Did you know? • Once a month Rwandans participate in Umuganda – a day of national housekeeping where everyone, including the president, undertakes community service. • Rwanda was one of the first countries in the world to ban plastic bags. • Lions were successfully reintroduced to the country in 2015 after an absence of 15 years. Roman Catholic 44%, Protestant 38%, Adventist 12%, Islam 2%, Atheist 3%, other 1%. Rwanda has a tough stance on corruption, making it one of the least corrupted countries in Africa. There is a dedicated phone number (tel: 2641) for members of the public to report acts of corruption. Begging is strongly discouraged by the government and you are advised not to give money to children who ask. During the last Saturday of every month, Rwandan citizens engage in Umuganda, essentially community work that could include litter picking, tree planting, building houses for the vulnerable, and more. Visitors are warmly encouraged to participate in Umuganda. Avoid talking about ethnicity or referencing the genocide, as this remains a very sensitive subject. Pointing with one finger is considered rude. When pointing, use all five fingers. Eating and smoking in the street is also considered rude. The official languages of Rwanda are Kinyarwanda, French and English. Swahili is also spoken in cities. Basic phrases in Kinyarwanda: Good Morning: Mwaramutse Good Afternoon: Mwiriwe Good evening: Mwiriwe Thank you: Urakoze Yes: Yee No: Oya Excuse me: Mbabarira","Despite its proximity to the equator (just 223km or 139 miles south of the equator), Rwanda's high altitude grants the country an agreeable climate year-round, with peak temperatures rarely climbing above 30°C (86°F) in the daytime or dropping below 15°C (59°F) at night. The long dry season is from June to mid-September, with July being the driest month. In addition, there are two annual rainy seasons, the first from mid-February to May and second from mid-September to December. Generally, the best time to visit Rwanda is during the long dry season from June to mid-September or the shorter second dry season from December to February. Visiting at the start or the end of the rainy seasons are ideal for travellers on a budget, with off-peak hotel rates and fewer crowds, as well as a chance of good, sunny weather. The best time to visit Kigali Kigali is a year-round destination with average highs ranging between 26°C (79°F) and 28°C (82°F). Hotels are usually busier during the peak season of June to September; although they offer good bargains during the rainy months, particularly from October to November, and from March to April. The best time to visit Volcanoes National Park The best time to visit Volcanoes National Park is during the dry season from June to mid-September, when paths are less muddy and easier to navigate. However, trekking permits are limited (to 96 per day) and are in high demand during this period, so book in advance. Gorilla treks do, however, run all year round, and the jungle is most luscious during the rainy season, which makes it a good time to visit for those who aren't fazed by getting wet. The best time to visit Akagera National Park The dry season (June-September) is the best time for spotting wildlife, as animals in the park gather at watering holes. Lightweights are required for most of the year with warmer clothes for cooler upland evenings. However, a waterproof jacket is advised, especially if visiting Volcanoes and Nyungwe National Parks. Long-sleeve clothing will help protect against mosquito bites (and therefore malaria) as well as sunburn. Rwanda is a small mountainous country in central Africa, bordered to the north by Uganda, to the east by Tanzania, to the south by Burundi and to the west by the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The country is divided by a mountain chain that runs across the country from north to south, but its highest peak is Mt Karisimbi (4,507m/14,787ft) in the Virunga Mountains, on the country's north-western border. South of Mt Karisimbi is Lake Kivu, which forms part of the western border with the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and is Rwanda's largest body of water. Central Rwanda features rolling hills giving way to savanna, plains, and swamps eastwards. Its capital, Kigali, is located in it the country's centre."
africa,sao-tome-e-principe,"The little-known islands of São Tomé e Príncipe provide unspoiled beauty and isolation from the world, in a way that's now rarely found anywhere else. The islands lie on an alignment of once-active volcanoes, with rugged landscapes, dense forests and palm-fringed beaches, situated 250km (155 miles) off the coast of West Africa. In São Tomé e Príncipe, exotic birds inhabit tropical jungles on what is one of Africa's smallest countries. The picturesque town of São Tomé lies exactly on the equator, with a smattering of colonial Portuguese architecture and attractive national parks. The history of the islands, meanwhile, is dominated by the slave trade and slave-worked plantations. The main appeal of São Tomé is perhaps its unrivalled peace and quiet. Little more than a couple of specks adrift off the coast of Gabon, the pair of volcanic islands are laid-back to say the least. The compelling Portuguese-Creole culture here revolves around leve leve, which roughly means 'take it easy'. Within a few hours of landing, the thought of rushing anywhere will seem like a distant memory. If you can muster the energy to do much beyond laying on the pristine beaches edged by swaying palm trees, you'll find the slopes of the volcanic peaks worthy of climbing for their dramatic vistas, as well as scintillating tracks through the otherworldly rainforest. There are multiple species of birds to be spotted, as well as endemic plants, and the exhilarating possibility to go whale watching. Aside from whales, turtles abound in the waters surrounding the islands. A good wander will bring you to both timeless fishing villages and historic buildings from the colonial era. Of these, roças, or plantations, are the most iconic man-made sights. The locals are keen to preserve the islands' natural wonders, and so the still burgeoning tourism industry is largely subservient to the ecological priorities of the inhabitants. None of your faceless resorts here. Expect family-run guesthouses and lodges perched on the edge of the jungle. 1,001 sq km (386.5 sq miles). 194,390 (UN estimate 2016). 193.8 per sq km. São Tomé.

They became a major transhipment centre for the slave trade until 1875 when slavery was abolished. Then a system of contract labour was introduced, which brought in people from other African countries to work on the plantations. There was, however, little improvement in the conditions of the black population and there were a number of rebellions against the Portuguese colonists over the years. It was not until 1975, following the fall of President Salazar in Portugal, that the nationalist movement, the Movimento de Libertação de São Tomé e Príncipe (MLSTP), finally forced the Portuguese government to grant it independence. São Tomé e Príncipe maintains close links with other former Portuguese colonies and with Gabon, Cameroon and Equatorial Guinea on the neighbouring mainland. Until 1984 it was also unquestionably a Soviet satellite. However, later that year, President da Costa declared São Tomé e Príncipe to be non-aligned. Da Costa was subsequently involved in mediating the talks that brought the long-running civil war in Angola to a close. In 1997, largely for financial reasons, the Government reversed one of its traditional foreign policy positions by establishing diplomatic relations with Taiwan at the expense of those with the People's Republic of China. At home, a new constitution was introduced in March 1990 allowing for the formation of opposition parties and the conducting of multi-party elections. The crucial election that followed in 1991 was dominated by the struggle between the former ruling party, the MLSTP and the main opposition party, the Partido de Convergência Democratica  Grupo de Reflexão (PCD). On that occasion the PCD narrowly won control of both the presidency and the national assembly. The most recent presidential election in July 2001 brought a comfortable victory for independent candidate Fradique de Menzes while the national assembly, returned a coalition of the MLSTP and PCD, under the leadership of the MLSTP's Maria das Neves Ceita Basptista. Democratic politics have survived in São Tomé somewhat against the odds. There has been a steady stream of coup attempts, most recently during 2003 when rebels took control of the country for several days. The political and economic stakes have been much increased by the recent discovery of substantial oilfields in Sao Tome's territorial waters. Commercial drilling began in 2005 and the government has already benifitted from the considerable windfall. Menezes has promised to work at clearing the country's debts and then plans to invest in modernising the country's public services.

africa,senegal,"Senegal is often known as 'The Country of Teranga'. Teranga means hospitality in the local tongue of Wolof, and you will indeed find Senegal to be one of the friendliest spots in West Africa. The locals are hospitable - once you get to know them, you may find yourself being invited to share a steaming cup of tea or even some delicious home-cooked meals. A simple wander around the local markets will unearth handmade fabrics and authentic arts and crafts, while on almost every street corner in the towns and cities you'll find musicians full of energy. It is also worth checking out bustling restaurants that serve up rich Senegalese cuisine influenced by the Maghrebis (inhabitants of northern Africa), French and Portuguese. Most visitors land in Dakar, the chaotic, fast-growing capital, packed with great nightlife and restaurants. However, Senegal also offers beautiful, untouched rural scenery, along with golden beaches, tropical rainforests and semiarid grasslands. Suffice to say, Senegal offers something unique for every traveller. Indeed, the diversity of Senegal is perhaps its best feature. The southern Casamance region boasts palm-fringed tropical beaches. The western region is bounded by the Atlantic Ocean, featuring a series of wetlands teeming with biodiversity, including one of the largest concentrations of migratory birds in the world. Then you have the relatively flat plains which give way to the mountainous region in the southeast – this is where the highest point of Senegal is found, reaching an elevation of 581m (1,906ft) near Népen Diakha. Adventurous travellers come to Senegal to surf some of the best waves in West Africa in year-round warm waters, hike through lush tropical rainforest-clad mountains, discover towering waterfalls or go deep-sea fishing in the depth of the continental shelf. With birds, giraffes, elephants, hippos, rhinos, lions and panthers abound, wildlife viewing is also high on the agenda among some travellers. Highbrow tourists won't be disappointed either. There are year-round music and art festivals such as the Saint-Louis Jazz Festival, as well as well-managed museums displaying some of the most interesting artefacts found in the region. You'll also find well-preserved colonial ruins and sites that remember the dehumanising Transatlantic slave trade. Senegal is easily accessible from Europe and the USA. The country offers an array of experiences, has warm temperature year-round and one of the best infrastructures in the region, so it is time to put Senegal on your radar and come for a visit. 196,712 sq km (75,951 sq miles). 16,657,759 (UN estimate 2020). 87 per sq km.

Trade with the Arabs was active and soon Islam arrived by the 11th century, although many local people still retained an element of animism. Europeans arrived in the 16th century. The Dutch purchased the Gorée Island in 1627 while the French built a factory on N'Dar, an island that became the old town of Saint-Louis. The French took over Gorée in 1677, making these two spots as active bases for slaves bound for the New World. In 1959, Senegal formed a federation with French Sudan (Mali) to create the Federation of Mali. The federation gained independence from France in 1960 but soon fell apart, resulting in two sovereign nations of Senegal and Mali. Léopold Sédar Senghor, a renown poet and politician, became Senegal's first president and ruled for 20 years. Senegal has played a prominent role in African politics since its independence. Its presidents have widened Senegal's diplomatic relationships with other parts of Africa while maintaining close economic, political and cultural ties to France. In 1982, Senegal and the Gambia (which is largely engulfed within the borders of Senegal) formed the confederation of Senegambia. But the integration didn’t work out and the federation was dissolved in 1989. Did you know? • Standing at 49m (161ft) tall, the African Resistance Monument in Dakar is the tallest statue in Africa. • Since independence in 1960, Senegal has sent athletes to every Summer Olympic Games.

Visitors should make an effort to learn greetings in one of the local languages, and a knowledge of basic French is also advisable. Handshaking between friends, regardless of how many times a day they meet, is common. Islam is the predominant religion in Senegal so visitors are advised to dress modestly. Casual wear is widely acceptable but scanty swimwear should be reserved for the beach. Smoking is prohibited in some public places (especially mosques). The official language is French. There are many local languages, principally Wolof. Other languages include Pulaar, Mandinka and Balanta-Ganja.","Situated just above the equator, Senegal benefits from a warm and tropical climate, which sees temperatures hovering from warm to extremely hot throughout the year. There are two main seasons – dry and rainy. The dry season runs from October to June in the north and from November to May in the south. This is also known as the Harmattan season, characterised by the dry and dusty wind blows from the Sahara Desert over West Africa. The dry season is often considered as the best time to visit, particularly from December to March as the days are warm. See the information below on Petite Côte and Cap Skirring if you are going on a beach holiday. The rainy season runs from July to September in the north and from June to October in the south. This period is also known as hivernage or wintering – despite the name, temperatures only drop a few degrees and the weather is still hot and humid. As the African monsoon arrives from the south, expect abundant rainfall in the south, particularly around the Casamance region. Beware that during the rainy season, it can be challenging to travel by car, especially in the south. The best time to visit Dakar Located on the tip of the Cape Verde peninsula, Dakar enjoys a mild weather with little fluctuation in temperatures, with an average high of 25°C (77°F) to 31°C (88°F) year-round. The city receives good rainfall from June to October, with August being the wettest month. The best time to visit Dakar is from November to May. The best time to visit Petite Côte A popular tourist area, Petite Côte (Little Coast) runs from Dakar to la Pointe de Sangomar. The beaches here are sheltered from currents and has a calm sea. Weather wise, the period from June to October is wetter than other months. If you want to avoid the rain, the best time to visit is from December to May. February is the coolest month with an average high of 24°C (75°F) and an average low of 19°C (66°F). The best time to visit Cap Skirring Cap Skirring is another popular resort area. Located in the south, it gets a fair bit of rain from June to October with August being the wettest month, but it gets very little rain from November to May. As it is closer to the equator than the Dakar and Petite Côte, the sea temperatures here are warmer, averaging 22°F (72°F) even during the cooler months (from January to April). Accordingly, the best time to visit Cap Skirring is from December to May. Senegal's tropical and humid climate means casual lightweight cotton clothing is recommended year-round. Long pants or long skirts, along with long-sleeved tops, are ideal. Islam is the predominant religion but the society is tolerant. Senegalese women do not wear a full-face veil so female travellers don't have to cover up but do dress modestly. Casual wear is widely acceptable but swimwear should be reserved for the beach. Mosquitoes are another thing to consider when packing. The likelihood of bites is high, so apart from long sleeves, pack some high-strength mosquito repellent. If you'll be in the Casamance region during the wet season waterproofs are essential. Sturdy shoes are necessary for any trekking and hiking activities, otherwise, normal shoes and sandals will do. Located just above the equator, Senegal is bordered by the Republic of Guinea and Guinea-Bissau to the south, Mali to the east, Mauritania to the north, and completely encloses the confederated state of The Gambia. To the west lies the Atlantic Ocean. Most land is less than 100m (330ft) above sea level, with plains constituting the majority of the country's geography, apart from the Fouta Djallon foothills in the southeast and the Bambouk Mountains on the Mali border. On the coast between Dakar and St Louis is a strip of shifting dunes. South of Dakar there are shallow estuaries along the coastline, which is fringed by palm trees. In the northern part of the country, south of the Senegal Basin, lies the arid Fouta Ferlo, a hot dry Sahelian plain with little vegetation. Senegal also hosts many environmental features, such as the five rivers that run through the country, which are the Senegal River, Saloum River, Gambia River, Geba River and Casamance River. Furthermore, there are two major lakes in the country, being Lake Retba and Lac de Guiers."
africa,seychelles,"Clichéd or not, the islands of Seychelles are about as close to paradise as you can get: once you have felt the sand between your toes and paddled in the crystal clear waters here, beach holidays will never be the same again. Made up of 115 topical islands in all, the Seychelles archipelago is a destination where white, sandy beaches are as pure as the driven snow; where frothy turquoise waters harbour colourful coral reefs and bountiful marine life; where secret coves allow you to have your very own Robinson Crusoe moment with only birds and tortoises for company. Mahé may be the biggest and the busiest of all the islands, but it has its fair share of secluded bays, which are accessible only by yacht, motorboat or on foot. Together with its sisters Praslin and La Digue, it attracts a constant surge of tourists. More adventurous travellers, on the other hand, may prefer to take a flying boat to more remote islands such as Fregate or Bird Island and enjoy secluded beaches all to themselves. These islands are especially popular with birdwatchers and nature lovers due to their abundance of wildlife. The absence of people on many of the islands means that rare plant life has thrived throughout this Indian Ocean archipelago. Tropical life abounds below the waves too, and is best viewed by going scuba diving or snorkelling, experiences which are made all the more memorable here thanks to the crystalline seas. Seychelles is more than just a natural sanctuary, though. The country is a veritable melting pot of cultures: its inhabitants descend from African, Asian and European immigrants, who have brought their customs and traditions with them to the islands. This heady mix is particularly pleasing on the palate thanks to the archipelago's fabulous fusion food. Seychelles is an extraordinarily alluring destination, and one that's guaranteed to whet your appetite for a return trip – assuming your bank balance can handle it. 452 sq km (175 sq miles). 95,850 (UN estimate 2019). 208 per sq km.

President Wavel Ramkalawan since 2020.","Seychelles is a relatively young nation, having claimed by France in 1756 and had French planters and slaves as its first settlers in August 1770. In 1811, British took control of Seychelles and made it a British Crown Colony in 1903. Despite this, the language and culture of the islands remained French with a small group of French-speaking plantation owners owning much of the land. Seychelles became an independent republic on 29 June 1976. Shortly afterwards, Seychelles underwent a period of single-party rule by the government of France-Albert René. In 1991, Seychelles amended its constitution to allow for a multiparty system of government, but the René remained highly popular and continued to serve as the President of Seychelles until 2004 when his long-term associate James Michel took over. Did you know? •	Victoria is one of the smallest capital cities in the world with just 26,500 inhabitants. •	Pirate treasures worth over €100,000 are said to be buried somewhere on the islands. •	The highly unusual jellyfish tree is endemic to the island of Mahé. 83% Roman Catholic, 2% Hindu, 1% Muslim. The people live a simple and unsophisticated island life and tourism is carefully controlled to protect the unspoilt charm of the islands. Before the international airport opened in 1971, the islands could be reached only by sea, and since they are miles from anywhere, visitors were few and far between, meaning the locals could develop their own unique language and culture. Shaking hands is the customary form of greeting in Seychelles. The Seychellois are very hospitable and welcome guests into their homes. When visiting someone's home, bringing a gift is acceptable. A mixture of imperial and metric systems operates. For example, petrol is dispensed in litres, while bars sell draught beer in half-pint measures. Casual wear is the norm but do dress up if attending a church service. Swimwear should only be worn on the beaches. The three official languages are Creole, English and French.","Lying just below the equator, Seychelles enjoys a warm tropical climate all year round. The weather is influenced by two monsoon seasons – Southeast and Northwest. Southeast Monsoon (June to September): The strong southeast trade winds bring a dry and slightly cooler weather to Seychelles, causing the average high in Mahé to dip two degrees to 28°C (82°F). Rainfall is also lower than other months, averaging 120mm (4.7 inches). The strong wind delights surfers, but not divers or swimmers as the sea is too choppy and dangerous. Northwest Monsoon (November to March): This is the rainy season, with December and January being the wettest months. Temperatures wise, the average high is around 30°C (86°F). The best time to visit Seychelles is during the transition months (April, May, and October). However, it must be said that April is hot and humid, with an average high of 32°C (90°F) and 170mm (7 inches) of rain. For the year-round warm weather, lightweight and cotton clothing is your best bet, with breathable waterproofs advisable during the rainy season. Sun hats, sunglasses and sunscreen are essential all year round. The Seychelles Archipelago occupies 400,000 square kilometres (154,400 square miles) of the Indian Ocean in the southern hemisphere, about 1,824km (1,133 miles) northeast of Madagascar. The archipelago comprises 115 granite and coral islands and atolls, most of which are inhabited. The Inner Islands refer to a collection of 43 islands clustering around Mahé, Praslin and La Digue. They are the political, cultural and economic hub of Seychelles. Unsurprisingly, 99% of the population live on the Inner Islands. 50% of Seychelles' landmass is protected as national parks and reserves, providing a sanctuary for some of the rarest species of flora and fauna on earth. Keep a lookout for Coco-de-mer, the jellyfish tree, paradise flycatcher, Seychelles warbler, Aldabra giant tortoise, to name but a few."
africa,sierra-leone,"Like one of its rough diamonds, Sierra Leone is a destination of exquisite natural beauty. But despite its lush rainforests, palm-fringed beaches, fascinating history and vibrant culture, the country remains largely unexplored and undiscovered. It’s hard to believe now, but Sierra Leone once attracted some 100,000 tourists a year. They were drawn to the country’s white sandy beaches, azure waters and swaying palms, until the horrors of civil war ravaged the country and knocked it off the tourism map. Suffice to say Sierra Leone remains somewhat overshadowed by this bitter and bloody conflict, which raged between 1991 and 2002. Dramatised in the 2006 film Blood Diamond starring Leonardo DiCaprio, the war is still one of the first things most people think about when Sierra Leone is mentioned. Happily, this negative reputation is gradually receding, and a new picture is emerging. Pioneering travellers are also trickling back to this corner of West Africa to rediscover the country’s many charms. In some ways, nothing has changed. Known locally as ‘Sweet Salone’, Sierra Leone remains one of the friendliest countries on the continent. The smiling people and relaxed vibe are characteristic of this small nation. Wherever you go, and whomever you meet, you’ll be greeted as though you are part of the family. Another thing you will notice in Sierra Leone is the abundance of wildlife. From hippos, forest elephants and chimpanzees, to bountiful birds and exotic insects, Salone is a dream ticket for nature enthusiasts. Pack your binoculars. It’s also a paradise for sun-seekers. In fact, Sierra Leone’s gorgeous sandy beaches are considered by many to be the best in West Africa. Combine this with the country’s off-the-beaten-track feel, welcoming people, and awe-inspiring scenery, and it’s easy to see why ‘Sweet Salone’ is being vaunted as an up-and-coming destination for adventurous travellers. 71,740 sq km (27,699 sq miles). 7,929,199 (UN estimate 2020). 106 per sq km. Freetown. Republic. President Julius Maada Bio since 2018. President Julius Maada Bio since 2018.","Sierra Leone has been inhabited for thousands of years. Previous to Sierra Leone’s discovery by the Portuguese explorer Pedro Da Cintra in 1462, the country was organised in small political units of independent kingdoms. After Sierra Leone’s discovery by the West, foreign trade began between the locals and Europe which soon lead to the British establishing a trading post on Bruce Island in Freetown Harbour, which was to stay a strategic point for trade for years to come. The capital city, Freetown, wasn’t founded until 1787 when freed slaves arrived from England and formed a settlement. Although the settlement failed, it was later established as a base for the suppression of the slave trade. The country prospered when the first college for higher education south of the Sahara, Fourah Bay College, was established in 1827 which meant the country was aptly nicknamed as the ‘Athens of West Africa’ for its early achievements in medicine, law and education. After several unsuccessful revolts against British rule, Sierra Leone gained independence in 1961, and adopted a parliamentary system of government under the leadership of its first Prime Minister, Sir Milton Margai, later becoming a republic in 1971. The escalating civil war in neighbouring Liberia spilt into Sierra Leone in the early-1990s and led to the darkest decade in the country’s recent history. General Joseph Momoh, Sierra Leone’s Prime Minister at the time, deployed troops to the border region to repel the Liberian rebels but the army also came under attack from the Revolutionary United Front (RUF), a home-grown Sierra Leonean movement led by Foday Sankoh, who had been collaborating with Liberian rebels. In April 1992 Momoh was deposed by Valentine E.M. Stasser, during whose reign the civil war worsened with the RUF taking control of the lucrative diamond mines. A military coup lead to Strasser being ousted in 1996, and civilians elected Ahmad Tejan Kabbah of the SLPP, who drew up a peace agreement with the RUF, but unfortunately, it was not implemented. The turbulent political situation continued into 1997 as dissident troops led by Major Johnny Koroma seized power. After intervention by ECOWAS (Economic Community of West African States) troops, supported by the international community, Kabbah’s government was reinstated in 1998. A political settlement was signed in July 1999; however, this was short-lived as the RUF refused to disarm and relinquish occupied areas. Fighting broke out again in May 2000, where the leader of the rebels Sankoh was captured. Peacekeeping forces finally brought conflict to an end in January 2002. With peace restored, former president Kabbah was re-elected in the same year. The APC’s Ernest Koroma was elected Sierra Leone's new president in 2007 with a promise to fight corruption and improve the quality of life within the country. Koroma was re-elected in 2012 in a democratic multi-party vote. The country experienced economic growth up until 2014 when Ebola struck Sierra Leone as well as the neighbouring countries of Liberia and Guinea. By the time the outbreak was contained in 2016, many lives had been lost, and the country’s economy had been devastated. In 2018, President Julius Maada Bio of the SLLP (a centre-left leaning party) won the general election with 43.3% of the vote. Did you know? •	The name of the country hails from the words ‘Sierra Lyoa,’ meaning ‘Lion Mountain Range’ in Portuguese. •	With a land area of 71,740 sq km (27,699 sq miles), Sierra Leone is one of the smallest republics in Africa. •	Sierra Leone’s diamond industry helped fund the years of military conflict. Islam is the most widely practised religion, with about 78% of the population being of the Muslim faith. This is followed by Christianity (all branches included) which make up about 20.9%. Other beliefs include traditional African religions, Buddhism, Hinduism and Judaism. Sierra Leone’s culture is a diverse blend influenced by the large amount of different ethnic groups inhabiting the country. The people of Sierra Leone are well known for their friendliness and hospitality, with a relaxed pace on life. The locals are expressive and joyful, and religious beliefs and customs are very much present in everyday life. Greetings are very important in Sierra Leonean culture, and elders are especially respected. It is common to be entertained in a hotel or restaurant, particularly for business visitors. Small tokens of appreciation are always welcome. Casual wear is suitable almost everywhere, however presentable and decent clothing is expected. Societies are a fundamental part of Sierra Leonean culture, especially exclusive or secret ones. These societies are split by gender, and the members must obey a strict code of conduct. The ‘Poro’ (male) and the ‘Sande’ (female) societies, for example, play an educational role in village culture for children who are reaching puberty. They are taught essential skills and knowledge important for their role within society. Music and dance are of huge importance to Sierra Leoneans; it is part of the fabric of normal life. Sierra Leone has an upcoming rap and reggae scene as certain rappers’ music is starting to infiltrate the charts. The most popular sports include football (soccer) fans, baseball and basketball, and several Sierra Leone-born athletes play professionally internationally. The official language is English; however, it is mainly used for governmental and media purposes. There are 23 living languages spoken within the country, the most prominent of those being Kiro, Mede, Temme and Limba. Kiro is the de facto national language as the most widely spoken language in Sierra Leone. It is mainly derived from English but has influences from other African languages, other European languages and some expressions found in the West Indies. A few useful words and phrases in Krio: • Kusheh? = Hello • Tenki = Thank you • Do ya = Please • How di bodi? = How are you?","The climate is tropical and humid all year. Between November and June, it is very hot and dry, although the coastal areas are cooled by sea breezes. In December, January and February the dry, dusty Harmattan wind blows from the Sahara. Rainfall can be torrential during the rainy season between May and November. In March there are sporadic rains, accompanied by strong winds, in the provinces when the heat of the dry season reaches its peak. If you decide to travel to the provinces during the month of March, it is advisable to bring waterproof clothing to avoid getting drenched when you least expect it. August has the most rainfall, and it is best avoided if you are looking for a sun-soaked holiday on Sierra Leone’s beautiful beaches, but it is also the time when wildlife activity is at its peak and therefore a period of the year that attracts a lot of nature lovers. There are no restrictions on clothing for men or women, with casual attire such as sleeveless shirts, flip flops and sandals the norm. Lightweight and light-coloured, cotton clothing is recommended due to the hot and humid climate. During the rainy season, it is advisable to wear wet-weather clothing, while a light jersey or jacket may be needed in the months when the Harmattan winds blow. Sierra Leone is bordered to the northwest, north and northeast by the Republic of Guinea, and to the southeast by Liberia. To the south and southwest lies the Atlantic Ocean. A flat plain up to 110km (70 miles) wide stretches the length of the coast except for the Freetown peninsula, where the Lion Mountains rise to 888m (2,913ft). In some coastal areas, sand bars have formed that stretch out as far as 112km (70 miles). Behind the coastal plain is the central forested area, drained by eight principal rivers, which has been cleared for agriculture. The land rises in altitude eastwards to the Guinea Highlands, a high plateau with peaks rising to over 1,830m (6,000ft) in the Loma Mountains and Tingi Hills area. The Mende tribe is prominent in the southeast and the Temne in the western and northern areas."
africa,somalia,"Think Somalia and what springs to mind? Pirates, Civil War, Islamic militants? Suffice to say it’s not your average holiday destination. Until 2012 the country had been without a government for two lawless decades and, although the fractured nation has witnessed a period of relative stability recently, it remains highly dangerous. Travel is possible in the northern districts of the self-proclaimed Republic of Somaliland, a quasi-independent state that has broken away from the rest of Somalia. Travellers, however, should avoid visiting other areas. And that's a shame, because behind the turmoil lies a destination of considerable beauty. Somalia has a varied landscape of mountains, deserts, tropical rainforests, undiscovered beaches and coral reefs. Sadly, much of it is under threat from unregulated logging, drought and the ongoing civil war. Modern day Somalia developed from a string of Arab sultanates, which were scattered along the northeast coast of Africa. As Arab influence waned during the late 19th century, the British, French and Italians designated these territories as protectorates. These were the subjects of various treaties, forged amid frequent clashes between the colonial powers and the neighbouring Ethiopians, and between the European powers themselves. The problems Somalia experiences today were sown in 1960, when the British and Italian Somalilands were merged. Inherited tribal rivalries and territorial disputes have dominated the country's history since. Years of fighting between rival warlords and an inability to deal with famine and disease have led to the deaths of up to one million people. The area is still extremely volatile, with attacks taking place, especially in the capital of Mogadishu. Those keen on travelling to the region would be well advised to visit neighbouring Ethiopia or Djibouti instead. But if you are set on Somalia, there are a handful of attractions to see including the Laas Geel cave complex, which offers exquisite Neolithic art and stunning rock formations Gorgeous beaches and beautiful coral reefs can also be found along the coast, but you’d have to be one dedicated beach bum to seek them out. 637,657 sq km (246,201 sq miles). 11,079,013 (UN estimate 2016). 16.6 per sq km.

As Arab influence waned, the British, French and Italians established protectorates on the Somali coast during the late-19th century. These were the subjects of various treaties, forged amid frequent border clashes between the colonial powers and the neighbouring Ethiopians.Modern Somalia was created on 1 July 1960 from British and Italian Somalilands. Inherited tribal rivalries and territorial disputes have dominated the country's subsequent history. The Somali Youth League held on to power throughout the 1960s, mostly under the leadership of President Shermake. Throughout that decade, the government aggressively pursued claims to the Ethiopian Ogaden region and parts of Kenya's Northern Frontier District, the latter resulting in a severance of diplomatic relations with the UK between 1964 and 1968. After President Shermake was assassinated in October 1969, a military coup installed Mohamed Siad Barre as president of the renamed Somali Democratic Republic. The new government built up close relations with the Soviet Union, which was especially keen to make use of the port of Berbera. However, the Soviets were also close to the revolutionary regime in Ethiopia, whose relations with Somalia deteriorated throughout the 1970s. Forced into a choice, the Soviets opted for Ethiopia, to which Siad Barre responded by building up links with the West and the USA in particular.His government collapsed in 1991 as civil war broke out and various regional factions jostled for position leaving the country without an effective central government. Various efforts backed by the international community to set a transitional government largely failed, although in 2004 the military was re-established and defeated the Islamic Court Union in the south. That lead to the formation of the militant Al-Shabaab terrorist group. However, in 2012 a new provisional constitution was enacted and the Federal Government of Somalia established with its capital in Mogadishu and in 2016 the first US ambassador to Somalia for 25 years took up his post as the United Nations welcomed a new timetable for elections towards the return of a multi-party system in 2018. Did you know? • Although home to a wealth of diverse regional cultures, all Somali food is halal. • Ancient dry stone burial pyramid structures known as 'taalo' litter the landscape. • During the early years of the civil war several autonomous regions were set up including Puntland, Somaliland and Galmudug, which survive to this day.  The state religion is Islam and the majority of Somalis are Sunni Muslims. There is a small Christian community, mostly Roman Catholic. Traditional dance, music, song and craftsmanship flourish despite gradual modern development.

Somalia is bordered to the north by the Gulf of Aden, to the south and west by Kenya, to the west by Ethiopia and to the northwest by Djibouti. To the east lies the Indian Ocean. Somalia is a semi-arid country and the scenery includes mountains in the north, flat semi-desert plains in the interior and a subtropical region in the south. Separated from the sea by a narrow coastal plain, the mountains slope south and west to the central, almost waterless plateau which makes up most of the country. The beaches are protected by a coral reef that runs from Mogadishu to the Kenyan border in the south."
africa,south-africa,"With golden beaches, jagged mountains and national parks overflowing with wildlife, South Africa is the Africa you’ve always imagined. While memories of a troubled past remain, the republic is well on the way to regaining its throne as the holiday capital of Africa, visited by nearly 10 million people every year. Topping a long list of attractions is the republic’s spectacular wildlife and natural scenery. National parks and nature reserves preserve an incredible variety of landscapes – rolling plains, towering mountains, arid deserts, coastal fynbos (shrubland) and pure blue oceans – home to an incredible variety of wildlife, from lions and elephants to great white sharks and playful penguins. South Africa's cities are no less varied. In the far south, lorded over by iconic Table Mountain, Cape Town is South Africa’s most accessible gateway, with gorgeous beaches, vibrant, multicultural neighbourhoods, famous vineyards, a lively nightlife and fine dining to rival any European capital. You’ll find a similarly cosmopolitan vibe in Johannesburg, the energetic capital, and in beachside Durban, where the hot sunshine is matched by the scorching curries cooked up by the South Asian community. In between you can lose yourself for days on safari. The undisputed top spot for wildlife spotters is world-famous Kruger National Park, where the Big Five – lions, leopards, elephants, buffaloes and rhinos – are joined by hundreds of other African species. If the landscape sounds diverse, wait until you meet the people. South Africa boasts 11 official languages and more than a dozen tribes, living alongside communities from Africa, Europe and the Indian subcontinent – little wonder this is known as the Rainbow Nation. This diversity is tangible everywhere, from the architecture and language to the nation’s spectacular cuisine. Nevertheless, huge inequality remains, still sharply marked out along racial lines. To understand modern South Africa, everyone should visit Johannesburg’s moving Apartheid Museum, and Robben Island prison, where Nelson Mandela was held for 18 years. Or you could join a township tour in Soweto, which, like the rest of your trip, you’ll never forget. 1,219,912 sq km (471,011 sq miles). 56,717,156 (2017). 46 per sq km.

A little over a century later, the Dutch East India Company set up a refreshment station at the Cape for ships and slaves toing and froing from Asia. The increasingly insatiable imperial appetite of the British meant they were never going to be far behind. As European influence and ambition gradually expanded into the hinterland, the indigenous population and various other African ethnic groups, who had migrated south over preceding centuries, were increasingly subjugated and outgunned. The white settlers’ bullying and bloodletting of black South Africans was formally institutionalised by the apartheid system of the National Party, which came to power in 1948 and whose reign was to be characterized by their forced removals of ‘non-whites’ from most urban areas and their increasingly violent suppression of anti-apartheid activists. The brutal suppression of black activism, which was carried out with callous efficiency, saw sanctions imposed by countries around the world. International isolation and increasingly violent civil unrest eventually broke the apartheid system, which officially began to dismantle in 1990 after negotiations between President FW De Klerk and the African National Congress (ANC) leader Nelson Mandela, in jail at the time on Robben Island. In 1994, South Africa’s first fully democratic elections swept the ANC to power and the iconic Mandela, finally a free man after serving 27 years behind bars, became the first president of the new South Africa, unswerving in his philosophy of forgiveness and reconciliation. But since Mandela’s retirement, South Africa’s young democracy has continued to be hampered by the legacy of apartheid, as is apparent in the stark socioeconomic and even geographical disparity between white South Africans and a small black elite on the one hand, and the vast majority of black South Africans on the other. Mandela’s successors have failed to fill his shoes, with the aloof Thabo Mbeki doing little to combat the twin ravages of violent crime and an AIDS pandemic, and current ANC leader Jacob Zuma and his cabinet better known for corruption, factionalism and philandering than effective governance. Did you know? • South Africa is the only country that boasts two Nobel Prize winners who lived on the same street. Nelson Mandela and Archbishop Desmond Tutu both had houses on Soweto’s Vilakazi Street. • There are more than 2,000 shipwrecks along South Africa’s coastlines, many of which date back at least 500 years. • In 2010, South Africa was the first African country to host the FIFA World Cup. • South Africa still has seven recognized royal families. 20 million South Africans fall within the various royal kingdoms. Around two thirds of South Africans are Christian of some form including Catholics, Anglicans, Dutch Reformed or African independent churches. Many Africans believe in traditional healers called sangomas, who give readings – including throwing the bones – and provide spiritual and emotional counselling and dispense African traditional medicines or muti. There are also significant Hindu, Muslim and Jewish communities. Johannesburg has areas that the descendants of former immigrants have made their own, including Fordsburg for the Indian community and Chinatown in Cyrildene. South Africa’s biggest cities are very westernised and hold few cultural surprises for Europeans. Handshaking is the usual form of greeting, sometimes in a more elaborate African handshake that foreigners will pick up readily. Casual wear is widely acceptable, especially in less formal Cape Town. Smoking is prohibited in public buildings and on public transport. The presence of so many diverse ethnic backgrounds certainly adds some spice outside of the main business centres. Rural areas most likely to be visited by travellers include Zulu land in KwaZulu Natal where communities are based in small traditional villages with round huts (rondevals) and a few hustling, bustling relatively poor towns. In Durban you’ll be entertained by beach-front Zulu dancers wearing full animal skin tribal regalia. A more modern form of culture is the now commercialised Gum Boot dance, performed in wellingtons and mining outfits and developed in men’s only mining hostels when entertainment was scarce. The official languages are Afrikaans, English, isiNdebele, isiXhosa, isiZulu, Sepedi, Sesotho, Setswana, Siswati, Tshivenda and Xitsonga.","Being in the southern hemisphere, South Africa’s seasons are the opposite of European seasons. The climate is seasonal, but the country enjoys at least seven months of sunshine, with temperatures dropping in the winter months of May to August. April and May are the most temperate months. Temperatures above 32°C (90°F) are fairly common in summer, and frequently exceed 38°C (100°F) in the lower Orange River Valley and the Mpumalanga Lowveld. The barren Northern Cape has some of the most extreme temperatures, sometimes cracking 40°C (104°F) in summer and plummeting to below freezing in winter. It's pleasantly warm and sunny in spring and autumn, and delightfully hot in summer (November-March) with frequent heavy tropical rains and sudden spring and summer hailstorms to cool things down. The thunder and lightning storms over Africa's big skies can be quite spectacular, but are best enjoyed through a window, not out in the open. These tropical storms can be vicious too, often causing flooding and turning urban streets into temporary streams, making driving hazardous. Wait an hour and it will all be over. Even in winters South Africa’s chill is nothing compared with European standards, with mild frost occasional, and snow a rarity. The rainiest months in Cape Town are May to August, although the weather in Cape Town is generally difficult to predict and can deliver all four seasons in one day. Christmas can be just too hot for game viewing in the safari parks, and it's also peak season for South African holidaymakers. Cape Town is a magnet for Jo'burgers at Christmas, so best avoided - visit in spring and autumn, when the weather is good and the crowds are smaller. Of the main cities, Durban is the hottest and can get remarkably hot and sticky in the summer. But it’s perfect in winter, where you can still wear shorts in temperatures that the locals consider a bit nippy. For summer in Africa you’ll need to keep cool, so pack lightweight clothes. In winter you’ll be surprised at how cold it can be in some areas, so bring a jumper or sweatshirt. You will never need a heavy coat or jacket, but a light raincoat can be useful, especially in Cape Town. For a safari bring long sleeves and long trousers, if only to protect against mosquitoes and thorn bushes. The game drives will either start out chilly with an 0600 start and end under the blazing sun, or vice versa, with a hot late afternoon start and a return after sunset, so take a wrap or pullover of some sort. The Republic of South Africa fills the southern tip of the continent and is lapped by the Atlantic Ocean to the west and the Indian Ocean to the east, and a swirling mixture of the two at the very tip. It totally encloses the independent kingdom of Lesotho, and is bordered by Namibia, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Mozambique and Swaziland to the north. A vast, interior plateau has sharp escarpments that rise above the lowland plains. Mountainous regions include the Drakensberg and Magaliesberg. The west coast is arid, while the south and southeast coasts are semi-arid, with vegetation fringed by sandy beaches and rocky coves. In contrast, the subtropical northeast has lush wetlands and coastal forests. The wildlife viewing areas are scattered throughout the country, with the famous Kruger National Park so vast that it encloses a wide variety of eco-systems.  Of its nine provinces, Gauteng, which houses Johannesburg and Pretoria in the northeast, is the smallest and most densely populated. The Northern Cape is the largest province covering between a third and quarter of the country, but containing only a tiny percentage of the population in this territory of desert and semi-desert wilderness."
africa,south-sudan,"There’s off-piste, and then there’s South Sudan. Officially the world’s newest nation, its poor infrastructure and volatile political climate will deter most from visiting this fledgling nation. But the intrepid few who do visit will discover some of the least known and most extreme natural phenomena on Earth. After a messy divorce from Sudan in 2011, the South Sudanese people are fiercely proud of their hard-fought independence and both surprised and pleased when someone choses to visit. Somewhat chaotic, and growing rapidly, the capital, Juba, has a superb location on the banks of the White Nile. Founded in the 1920s, it exhibits some excellent examples of British colonial architecture around the Hai Jalaba district, though most visitors will want to leave man-made structures behind and head for the country’s natural wonders. The vast swampy Sudd region, known locally as Bahr el Jebel or “Mountain Sea” is where the Nile forms one of the world’s largest inland wetlands. A habitat safe from poachers for large populations of hippos, it is a unique experience to explore its vast islands of reeds by canoe. Boma National Park not only boasts large populations of Africa’s most iconic wildlife species, including elephant, giraffe and lion, but also the greatest migration of mammals on Earth, when an estimated two million grazing animals flee en mass for pastures new. The region is also renowned for its traditional tribal homesteads, which dot the plains. Not content with rivers, swamps and savannah, South Sudan’s natural prowess extends to the Imatong Mountains, and the star attraction here is Kinyeti, the highest mountain in the country at 3,200m (10,500ft). The South Sudanese consider their homeland blessed and it’s hard to disagree when you see the sheer diversity of natural landscapes the country has to offer. Road travel can be uncomfortable, but the end result is certainly well worth any hardship. 644,329 sq km (248,777 sq miles). 12,733,427 (UN estimate 2016). 18.7 per sq km. Juba. Republic. President Salva Kiir Mayardit since 2011. President Salva Kiir Mayardit since 2011.","It was the great migrations of tribes that gave South Sudan its modern shape and ethnic mix. In the 15th century the Shilluk settled along the White Nile, followed by the pastoralist Dinka, and Azande from the Congo basin, two centuries later. In the mid-19th century, Egypt pushed south into the Sudd, as other foreigners were also penetrating South Sudan. The 1860s saw the expeditions of the explorers John Hanning Speke, James Grant and Samuel and Florence Baker, all attempting to map the source of the Nile. After the British crushed the Mahdist uprising in 1898, Sudan was governed as an Anglo-Egyptian Condominium, ostensibly ruled by both countries but in practice a British colony. The British enacted the Closed Districts Ordinance, effectively shutting the South off from Khartoum, with many envisaging the south becoming part of British East Africa. The split from the north began to become irrecoverable even before Sudanese independence in 1956. An army mutiny in the south in 1955 broke into full-scale civil war on independence. The war lasted until 1972, when significant political autonomy was granted to the south. Peace lasted until 1983, when the north repealed this agreement, and Islamic sharia law was introduced. There was intense hardship and famine for the civilian population, caused by drought but exacerbated by renewed war. In 2002, internationally-sponsored talks produced a rolling ceasefire. The following year a formal end to hostilities was announced. As part of negotiations, John Garang, leader of the South’s rebel army, was made Sudanese vice-president. Garang was killed in a helicopter crash several months later. His successor, Salva Kiir, was left to implement the peace deal. The needs for reconstruction were massive, and border disputes over the oil-rich Abyei region, split between north and south, dominated events. In February 2011, a referendum on Southern independence was held in a largely peaceful atmosphere, with over 98% of southerners voting to secede from Sudan. Africa’s newest nation was born six months later on 9 July. Did you know? •	Alternative names in contention for the new nation included Nile Republic, Azania, and Kush Republic. •	83% of the population live in traditional round stick and mud constructions called tukels. •	The first baby born in South Sudan, on Independence Day itself, was a boy later named Independent. •	The national anthem was chosen after holding an open competition. A mixture of Christian and traditional animist beliefs. There are many restrictions on photography: the authorities regard many sites as sensitive or strategic. Such decisions are often made on the spot and with seeming arbitrariness. English and Arabic are the official languages.",
africa,sudan,"Sudan is hardly your archetypal tourist destination, but behind the unsavoury headlines is a country of exquisite natural beauty, ancient historical attractions and inhabitants well versed in the art of hospitality. A vast country, three times the size of Texas, Sudan is as much about people as it is natural or man-made wonders. It is a nation where travellers can learn more drinking freshly prepared smoothies with the residents of Khartoum (Sudan is officially alcohol free) than they can by visiting one of the capital’s excellent museums. A relatively young city, Khartoum was built in 1821 at the confluence of the Blue and White Niles while the country was ruled jointly by Britain and Egypt. History and traditionalism jostle with modernity in the city, where stunning classical Islamic architecture in red ochre hues stands beside modern glass and steel skyscrapers paid for by the country’s oilfields (which were mostly lost with the independence of South Sudan in 2011). Centuries before colonial rule Sudan comprised a series of city-states. One of the longest lasting was Meroë, which sits some 200 km (125 miles) northeast of Khartoum. A UNESCO World Heritage Site, this ancient city features more than 200 steep-sided pyramids, which were built as elaborate royal mausoleums. They rise from the sandy dunes of the Nubian Desert and date from between 300 BC and AD 300, when the kingdom was at its most powerful. Worth visiting in itself, the Nubian Desert – in reality part of the Sahara – offers solitude and unspoiled natural beauty stretching east all the way to the Red Sea and Port Sudan, the centre of Sudan’s burgeoning diving scene. One of the least visited countries in East Africa, but one of the friendliest, Sudan has a magical mix of history, tradition and modernity that belies its status as a pariah state. 1,861,484 sq km (718,723 sq miles). 41,175,541 (UN estimate 2016). 19.1 per sq km. Khartoum. Federal republic. De facto ruler in the interim: Abdel Fattah Burhan, since 2021. Prime Minister Osman Hussein since January 2022.","Sudan’s earliest civilisations sprung up along the Nile, growing into the Kingdom of Kush during the 8th century BC. Kush conquered Egypt and adopted many facets of Egyptian culture, including burying its kings in pyramids found at Meroe. The region converted to Christianity in the AD 6th century, and then to Islam in the 14th century. Modern Egypt conquered Sudan in the 1820s, turning the country into a slave market, but within 60 years jointly administered it with Britain, which was keen to control the area around the newly-built Suez Canal. Sudanese resistance against foreign rule was led by Mahdi Mohammed Ahmed, a figure revered as both a mystic and a holy warrior. The Mahdist armies kicked both the Egyptians and British out, holding Khartoum until the British re-conquered the territory in 1898. By the mid-20th century, the Sudanese were once more clamouring for independence, which was granted in 1956. Resenting the political domination of the north, the mostly Christian and animist southerners launched an insurrection against the Khartoum government. This was the trigger for a conflict that raged on and off for five decades and claimed an estimated two million lives. President Nimeiri ended the first civil war in 1972, granting the south considerable autonomy. He set about giant infrastructure projects aiming to turn Sudan into Africa’s breadbasket, but ended up driving the economy into the buffers. Pressure from northern political parties also meant the rescinding of Southern autonomy, the return of civil war, and an army coup. A cycle of elections and coups has shaped much of Sudan’s post-independence history. In 1989, General Omar al-Bashir seized power. It wasn’t until the change of geopolitics brought about by 9/11 that Sudan started to shift from its hard-line Islamist position. Flush with money from its new oilfields it sought peace with the south, which became independent in July 2011, although clashes continue. At the same time, a struggle for resources in Darfur sprang into full rebellion. Repression from Khartoum led to President Bashir becoming the first head of state to be indicted by the International Criminal Court for crimes against humanity. Did you know? •	There are more pyramids in Sudan than in Egypt. •	Sudanese weddings can last for up to a week. •	Sudan dropped from being the largest to third largest country in Africa after the independence of South Sudan. Muslim in the north; Christian and traditional animist beliefs in the south. In the north, Arab culture predominates, while the people in the more fertile south belong to many diverse tribes, each with their own lifestyle and beliefs. Because Sudan is largely Muslim and operates Sharia, women should not wear revealing clothing., although they are not expected to wear a veil or cover their heads. At official and social functions as well as in some restaurants, formal clothes are expected. The Sudanese have a great reputation for hospitality. A curfew operates in major cities from 0000-0400. Photography: There are many restrictions on photography: a photography permit can be obtained from the External Information Office at the Ministry of Information in Khartoum. Arabic is the official language. English and many local dialects are widely spoken.","Extremely hot (less so November to March). Sandstorms blow across the Sahara from April to September. In the extreme north, there is little rain but the central region has some rainfall from July to August. The southern region has much higher rainfall, the wet season lasting May to October. Summers are very hot throughout the country, whilst winters are cooler in the north. Tropical clothes all year, warmer clothes for cool mornings and evenings (especially in the desert). Sudan is bordered by Egypt to the north, the Red Sea to the northeast, Ethiopia and Eritrea to the east, South Sudan to the south, the Central African Republic and Chad to the west, and Libya to the northwest. There is a marked difference between the climate, culture and geography of northern and southern Sudan. The far north consists of the contiguous Libyan and Nubian deserts which extend as far south as the capital, Khartoum, and are barren except for small areas beside the Nile River and a few scattered oases. This gives way to the central steppes which cover the country between 15°N and 10°N, a region of short, coarse grass and bushes, turning to open savannah towards the south, largely flat to the east but rising to two large plateaux in the west and south, the Janub Darfur (3,088m/10,131ft) and Janub Kordofan (500m/1,640ft) respectively. Most of Sudan's agriculture occurs in these latitudes in a fertile pocket between the Blue and White Niles which meet at Khartoum. South of the steppes is a vast shallow basin traversed by the White Nile, and the border with South Sudan."
africa,tanzania,"If you close your eyes and conjure up the quintessential romantic image of Africa, what you’ll most likely imagine is Tanzania: the drama of the wildebeest migration along a seemingly-endless savannah; the incongruous snow and glaciers of Mt Kilimanjaro; the iconic and statuesque Maasai warriors; the exotic palm-fringed beaches on the spice islands of Zanzibar. It’s all here. Tanzania boasts some of the most impressive national parks and game reserves in Africa. The Serengeti National Park is considered the continent’s premier spot to see wildlife roam unheeded across vast open plains. Nearby, within the steep walls of the Ngorongoro Crater lies the most densely concentrated population of African mammals on earth. Not to be forgotten, the Selous Game Reserve is larger than Switzerland, and is wild, remote and still virtually untouched by humans. Even further from the beaten path are parks in the extreme west of the country which offer the unique opportunity to track chimpanzees in their natural habitat on the fringes of Lake Tanganyika, one of Africa’s Great Lakes. Beyond its safari stalwarts, Tanzania has no less than 804km (503 miles) of sublime coastline and pearly-white beaches with some magnificent islands offshore. Known as the Swahili Coast, this was a favoured stop on ancient trading routes between the Indian sub-continent and the Middle East. Spices, jewels and slaves once passed through, bringing with them a mélange of cultural riches that remain today. Tanzania’s not short on mountains either. The striking and snow-capped Mt Kilimanjaro is Africa's tallest at 5,895m (19,341ft) and climbing it is an unforgettable experience. Its slightly smaller sister Mt Meru is arguably even prettier, and a quicker climb. Tanzania is home to more than 120 different ethnic groups and cultures, but it has seen little of the ethnic or religious-based violence that has afflicted certain other nations in the region. In fact the country is an inherently peaceful place and embraces its multicultural heritage, which adds to its broad appeal. 945,087 sq km (364,900 sq miles). 55,155,473 (UN estimate 2016). 54 per sq km. Dodoma. Federal republic. President Samia Suluhu Hassan since 2021. Zanzibar is semi-autonomous and has its own parliament and president (President Hussein Mwinyi since 2020). Kassim Majaliwa since 2015.","There are over 120 ethnic groups on the Tanzanian mainland, most of whom migrated from other parts of Africa over the millennia, whilst on the coast, the Swahili people originated from an eclectic mix of traders – Arabic, Persian and Chinese among others – who arrived from as early as the 8th century. The first European arrival was the Portuguese explorer, Vasco da Gama, who visited the coast in the late-15th century, after which most of the littoral region came under Portuguese control. The Portuguese also controlled Zanzibar until 1699, when they were ousted from the island by Omani Arabs. In the late-19th century, along with Rwanda and Burundi, Tanganyika was absorbed into the colony of German East Africa until the end of WWI. Then, following the German defeat, it was administered by the British under successive League of Nations and United Nations mandates. Tanganyika became independent in 1961, under charismatic socialist leader, Julius Nyerere, who was President until 1985. In 1964, Tanganyika joined with Zanzibar and became Tanzania. Since independence, Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM), has remained the ruling party. Tanzania proved itself an active player in regional politics, by giving support to anti-apartheid movements in South Africa, and it intervened militarily in Uganda in 1979, to overthrow the Amin regime. In 1985, Nyerere retired and was replaced by Ali Hassan Mwinyi, who introduced market forces into the economy and on the political front, amendments to the constitution allowing for the introduction of a multiparty system. Nevertheless, the CCM comfortably won the 1995 elections, when Benjamin Mkapa became president. In August 1998, Tanzania was the scene of a major terrorist incident when the US embassy in Dar es Salaam was bombed. October 1999 was marked by the death of ex-president Julius Nyerere. Mkapa won a further term of office in 2000 amid vote rigging and intimidation allegations, particularly on Zanzibar. Again in the 2005 election, Zanzibar experienced tension and some violence when the CCM candidate Jakaya Kikwete was declared the winner, a result disputed by the Civic United Front (CUF), which claimed they’d won the majority of votes. However, negotiations between the two parties in 2009 ushered in peaceful elections in 2010 following a power-sharing agreement. In 2015, John Magufuli became Tanzania’s new president and has been praised for his no-nonsense approach and zero tolerance towards corruption and frivolous government expenditure. Did you know? • Tanzania gained world fame when the celebrated American author Ernest Hemingway wrote about his time in the country in ‘The Green Hills of Africa’. • Some of the earliest remains of humans were recovered in Olduvai Gorge in Tanzania. • Tanzania shares a national anthem with South Africa and Zimbabwe. About 40-45% of Tanzania's population is Christian and about 35-40% are Muslim (most of which live along the coast and Zanzibar and the other islands). A small number follow traditional religions and there are some Asian communities including Sikhs and Hindus. When meeting and parting, hands are always shaken; this applies throughout the country in both rural and urban areas. It is the convention to use the right hand, not the left, to shake hands or pass or receive anything. The standard greeting of 'hello' is jambo. People are delighted if visitors can greet them in Kiswahili. Dress is on the whole casual but a smart appearance for formal occasions such as a business meeting or upmarket restaurant is always appreciated. Because of its Muslim influence, the coast is a little more conservative, and away from the beach it is advised to dress respectably and cover up bare arms and legs. Alcohol is only available in the tourist areas on Zanzibar, where it is also considered highly impolite to eat, drink or smoke in public during daylight hours when people are fasting during Ramadan (the exception to this is in the tourist hotels and restaurants). Kiswahili and English are the official languages. The terms Swahili and Kiswahili are used interchangeably, though the term Swahili normally refers to the people while Kiswahili refers to the language. Originating along the coast, Kiswahili is a Bantu language with many words derived from Arabic. Other African languages such as Bantu and those of Nilo-Hamitic and Khoisan origin are also spoken in more remote regions.","The climate is tropical and coastal areas are hot and humid, while the northwestern highlands are cool and temperate. There are two rainy seasons; the short rains are generally from October to December, while the long rains last from March to June. The central plateau tends to be dry and arid throughout the year.Tanzania can be visited year-round, although the best time for travelling is outside of the rainy season between June and October, when temperatures stay well below their summer peaks. Beach side locations like Zanzibar can be fine to visit during the hotter months of December to January, when ocean breezes make the high temperatures bearable (though humidity can still be high). However, this is also the time popular for typical beach holidays, especially for those travelling from Europe wanting some winter sunshine, and hotels can book up early especially for the Christmas and New Year period. Tropical clothing is worn throughout the year, but in the cooler season, from June to September, jackets and sweaters may be needed, especially in the evenings. Clothing appropriate to temperatures below zero is required on the higher slopes of Kilimanjaro and Meru. Also note that it can get very cold at night on the rim of the Ngorongoro Crater and early morning game drives may be chilly before the sun comes up. The United Republic of Tanzania lies on the east coast of Africa and is bordered by Kenya and Uganda to the north; by Burundi, Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo to the west; by the Indian Ocean to the east; and by Zambia, Malawi and Mozambique to the south. The Tanzanian mainland is divided into several clearly defined regions: the coastal plains, which vary in width from 16 to 64km (10 to 39 miles) and have lush, tropical vegetation; the Masai Steppe in the north, 213 to 1,067m (698 to 3,500ft) above sea level, which gives rise to two prominent mountains, Kilimanjaro, 5,895m (19,341ft) above sea level and Africa's highest peak, and Mount Meru, 4,565m (14,973ft); and there's a high plateau known as the Southern Highlands in the southern area towards Zambia and Lake Malawi. Savannah and bush cover over half the country, and semi-desert accounts for the remaining land area, with the exception of the coastal plains. Over 53,000 sq km (20,463 sq miles) is inland water, mostly lakes formed in the Rift Valley and Tanzania's share of Lake Victoria and Lake Tanganyika, both on its western border. Lake Victoria covers 69,490 sq km (26,832 sq miles), which is Africa's largest lake and 49% of it lies in Tanzania. With maximum depths of 1,470m (4,821ft), Lake Tanganyika is estimated to be the deepest lake in Africa and is 673km (420 miles) long and averages 50km (31 miles) across; 41% of its area lies in Tanzania. The United Republic of Tanzania includes the islands of Zanzibar and Pemba, about 45km (28 miles) off the coast to the northeast of the country."
africa,togo,"A great introduction to Africa, ever smiling Togo is a melting pot of more than 40 tribes that together have managed to create a relaxed yet offhand charm in a country so small you can drive across it in under an hour.  Even its biggest city, the capital, Lomé, feels more like a town and is small enough to comfortably traverse on foot. Experience Togolese joie de vivre at the Grand Marche, which occupies an entire city block and sells everything from artisan products to fresh fruit. Better yet head to the Fetish Market, where fetish priests will fix you up with your own protective charm. Voodoo and other animist beliefs are not just for tourists, with half the population following such practices. Togoville, on the banks of Lac Togo, is the historic home of voodoo in the country, and is a great place to learn more about religious customs and the meaning of shrines. Meanwhile, the lake itself is becoming something of a weekend retreat for the burgeoning middle-class and its desire for fine food and exciting nightlife. Few leave the palm-fringed Atlantic beaches of Lomé and Aneho, but those who do head off the beaten track and into the hills or savannah will be richly rewarded. The hills offer superb hiking among the dense green foliage of coffee and cocoa plantations, and are where you can find the Kloto carvers, famed for creating multiple connected rings from a single piece of wood. The savannahs of the north, by contrast, offer the chance to witness a more traditional way of life. Considered a symbol of Togo itself, Koutammakou is home to the remarkable takienta mud houses of the Batammariba people, structures that need to be seen to be believed.

Lomé. Republic. President Faure Gnassingbé since 2005. Prime Minister Victoire Tomegah Dogbé since 2020.","At the turn of the 15th century, Togo was populated by Kwa people and tribes from along the River Volta. Over the next 200 years, they were joined by Ewe people from Nigeria and Ane from Ghana and Côte d'Ivoire. During the 18th century the coast was occupied by Danish colonialists, but by the late 19th century Denmark had been replaced by Germany, which established the Togoland protectorate. The administration was overthrown by a joint Anglo-French force early in WWI. Then, in 1922, the country was divided into a French-controlled eastern region and a British-controlled western sector, both governed under a League of Nations mandate. After an UN-sponsored referendum in 1956, the British sector merged with the neighbouring colony of Gold Coast (Ghana), while the French sector became the Republic of Togo. Civilian government lasted just a few years before a military coup brought Lieutenant-Colonel Etienne Eyadéma to power in 1967. Eyadéma's authoritarian style spawned several coup attempts, though he remained in office until his death in February 2005. Earlier, in August 1991, Togo had been at the vanguard of a democratic revolution sweeping Africa, with a national conference convened to chart a path to democracy. The conference stripped Eyadéma of executive powers and installed a transitional administration. In November, the administration made a serious tactical error by banning Eyadéma's party, the RPT. The army mutinied, and only the arrival of French paratroopers brought the violence to a halt. When elections were eventually held in 1993, after multiple postponements, opposition parties boycotted or were disqualified. Tension only eased when the RPT lost power in 1994, although Eyadéma was convincingly re-elected president in 1998, and then again in 2003. On his death, the constitution was hastily changed and Eyadéma's son, Faure, assumed power. International condemnation forced him to resign just 20 days later until elections were held. Against a backdrop of violence and accusations of vote rigging and intimidation, Faure won the election with 60% of the vote. As president he oversaw the formation of a transitional unity government to prepare the country for benchmark elections in 2007 that were considered largely free by international observers. Did you know? •	At the time of his death Eyadéma was the longest-serving leader in modern African history, having held the presidency for 38 years. •	After WWI it was considered that the then German colony should instead be administered by Czechoslovakia. •	The name Togo means ‘water shore’ in Ewe. 50% traditional or animist, 35% Christian and 15% Muslim. Music and dance are the most popular forms of culture. The Togolese have had a varied colonial heritage which has resulted in the variety of Christian denominations and European languages; the voodoo religion is a strong influence in the country and many young girls, after fulfilling an initiation period, will devote their lives to serving the religion and the voodoo village priest.

africa,tunisia,"From broad sweeps of beach overlooked by a tumble of sugar-cube houses, to grand ancient ruins and the vast, rolling dunes of the Sahara, Tunisia encapsulates everything that’s enticing about North Africa. Lose yourself in the maze of medina alleyways inTunis, explore the Maghreban mosques of Kairouan and stand on the shimmering salt flats of Chott El Jerid. Tuck into freshly baked brik at a bustling street market, pretend to be a Roman gladiator at El Jem’s impressive amphitheatre and hoist yourself onto a camel for a trip into the desert. Traditionally, sun-seeking tourists came to Tunisia for its beaches – lining the Mediterranean, the long, rambling coastline is impressive. There are also tiny coastal villages where fishermen haul in the day’s catch on quiet beaches and cobblestone streets are lined with blooming bougainvillea. But Tunisia is so much more than a seaside destination where visitors lounge on the sands all day long. Join the locals at a café after the last notes of the call to prayer have faded, or puff on apple-scented shisha as you watch old men play dominos. Alternatively, get scrubbed and steamed on a marble slab under the tiled domes of a hammam. Or haggle in the souks, sipping glasses of mint tea while you barter for the best price. Suffice to say the age-old traditions of Tunisian life are still alive and well. Regarded as one of North Africa’s most politically moderate countries, Tunisia balances traditional Islamic culture with modern influences. Beyond the ancient medina, the cities are full of restaurants, cafes and bars, many of which have a European air about them. Though tourism took a hit in recent years after a number of suicide attacks on tourists and the authority. The Tunisian government is working to improve security in major cities and tourist resorts. 163,610 sq km (63,170 sq miles). 11,375,220 (UN estimate 2016). 67.4 per sq km. Tunis. Republic. President Kaïs Saïed since 2019. Ahmed Hachani since August 2023.","Like much of North Africa, Tunisia's history is one littered with conquests that completely changed the country's path. The most famous people of the ancient world to mark the area of modern-day Tunisia were the Phoenicians, who settled here in the 1st millennium BCE and went on to found their legendary capital of Carthage. The Phoenicians' expanding regional power brought them to the attention of the Ancient Greeks, and later Rome, leading to the Punic Wars. After three wars, Rome emerged victorious and it is largely their mighty monuments that have survived in Tunisia today. As Rome waned, the region fell first into the hands of the Byzantine Empire, but it was the Arab Conquest of the 7th century CE that changed the land forever, introducing Islam and a sophisticated culture. Further invasions in the 11th to 13th centuries by Arab tribesman, then Almoravids and Almohads transformed the region even further, bringing near-total Arabisation, new cities and sparkling mosques. By the 16th century, the Ottoman Turks had incorporated Tunisia into their vast empire, though left little mark on the masses. They held sway until the 19th century 'Scramble for Africa' by European empire builders. The Italians were initially most prominent, until French troops invaded from the neighbouring colony in Algeria, and made Tunisia a French protectorate in 1881. Independence from France was achieved in 1956, and Habib Bourguiba became the country’s first president. His government was responsible for many of the facets that still shape Tunisia today, from widespread public education to female emancipation. Bourguiba was succeeded by President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali in 1987, who billed himself as a great moderniser, and announced major economic reforms. Despite this, his regime was guilty of numerous human rights offences and widening inequality, while cronyism and corruption became norms in the latter years of his dictatorship. At the same time, nearly all forms of opposition to Ben Ali's government were repressed through a powerful security apparatus. In December 2010 rising disenchantment with the regime led to widespread public demonstrations over unemployment, poverty, and freedom of speech, which became known as the Jasmine Revolution and was the trigger for the Arab Spring that swept across the region. Ben Ali was forced to step down as president in January 2011, ushering in a new democratic era. Did you know? • The Berbers are believed to have arrived in modern-day Tunisia around 2000 BCE; there remains a small but significant Berber minority. • During the French protectorate, Tunisians could become French citizens – only if they renounced their 'Muslim' status. • Until independence, there were almost 100,000 Italians living in Tunisia. The principal religion is Islam; there are small Roman Catholic, Protestant and Jewish minorities. Arabic in culture and tradition, Tunisia is a liberal and tolerant Muslim society with many equality laws enshrined in the Tunisian Constitution brought in by the country's first president Habib Bourguiba. Polygamy is outlawed, women are free to choose whether to wear the headscarf, and have the right to ask for divorce, work, run their own businesses, and have access to abortion and birth control. Although cities like Tunis, Sfax and Sousse can seem extremely liberal and modern, it is important to remember that in more rural areas local life is much more traditional. Outside of resort areas visitors should dress modestly out of respect for their culture. Most Tunisian men would not be caught dead wearing shorts once off the beach and in the countryside it is practically unheard of. Likewise, once away from touristy areas, women should avoid wearing skimpy, revealing clothing. When visiting mosques and other religious buildings, both sexes should make sure their clothing covers their upper arms and knees, and women should wear a headscarf. On a separate note, Tunisians take a lot of pride in their dress and although informal clothing is now very acceptable among younger Tunisians, visitors will garner more respect if they don’t dress scruffily. Shaking hands is the usual form of greeting. Women greeting other women and men greeting other men will often also kiss each other the cheek. It is common to place your right hand across your heart after shaking hands. This is also a polite way of showing your thanks. Occasionally, among more religious people greeting people of the opposite sex, this is used as a greeting instead of shaking hands. Hospitality is important in Tunisia and a small gift in appreciation of hospitality or as a token of friendship is always well-received.  The official language is Arabic. French is the second language, English, German and Italian are spoken mainly in tourist resorts. Hello/hi = salaam Good morning = sbaah al-kheer Good evening = masaa al-kheer Goodbye = bi-salaama Yes = naam No = La Please = min fadlak Thank you = ayshik You're welcome = blaa imzeeya What is your name? = waash ismek? My name is = asmee How are you? = kee raak? I'm fine = la bas ilhamdulilah Where are you from? = minaan inta? I'm from = ana min","The areas of northern Tunisia that draw the most tourists have a typical Mediterranean climate, with hot, dry summers and mild, occasionally rainy winters. Along with destinations like Egypt and Turkey, Tunisia has claimed a good slice of the Mediterranean summer holiday market, making June to August a popular time for coastal resorts. Spring and autumn both offer their own enticements though, both in terms of an appealing climate and a lessening of tourist traffic. This is the best time to visit the desert regions of the south and central Tunisia, as in summer the temperatures can climb to stifling heights, whilst in winter the Sahara can be bitterly cold at night. Winter is low season in Tunisia and hotel prices often drop during the months of December to February. There are still plenty of sun-filled days but temperatures drop substantially once the sun has set and you need to come prepared for rain. If you’re visiting Tunis, December to March are the rainy season so pack an umbrella with you. May is a lovely time to visit as temperatures averaging 21C (70F). July and August are dry, but hot, averaging 28C (83F). Sousse, located on the Gulf of Hammamet, has largely the same weather pattern as Tunis, though it is slightly cooler in comparison. If you are travelling in summer, lightweight clothing made from natural fibres such as cotton and linen are best to cope with the heat. Unless you will be exclusively staying on a resort, pack some longer sleeved tops, and long trousers or skirts for off-the-beach wear. In winter you'll need a rain jacket and a warm pullover to put on for the evenings. It's a good idea to bring these if you're travelling in spring and autumn as well. The Republic of Tunisia lies on the North African coast, 130km (80 miles) southwest of Sicily and 160km (100 miles) due south of Sardinia. Dwarfed by its neighbours, sandwiched between Algeria to the west and Libya to the east, Tunisia is just over 163,000 sq km in size. It may be small but Tunisia has a landscape which varies from the cliffs of the north coast, to the woodland of the interior, from desert to rich, arable land, and from mountains to salt pans below sea level. The 1,148 km (713 miles) Mediterranean coastline is dotted with small islands, notably Djerba in the south and Kerkennah in the east. The coastline is backed by lush pasture, orchards, vineyards and olive groves and is the most populous area of the country. The north of the country is increasingly mountainous with rolling pine-clad hills a large feature of the landscape. South of Gafsa and Gabès the central region's countryside becomes starker with semi-arid plains as the Sahara begins to exert its influence. The desert region of the Sahara is one of Tunisia's most famous features. Its diverse environment of mammoth salt pans, vast sand plains and towering dunes, interspersed with lush oases forms the landscape of the south."
africa,uganda,"A reputation for political instability and the looming shadow of Idi Amin have long – and unfairly – blighted Uganda’s fledgling tourism sector. Now, though, things are looking up for the East African nation once described as “the pearl of Africa” by Winston Churchill. And a brief look around is enough to show you why. From the second you step off the plane, the overwhelming impression of Uganda is one of rich natural diversity, friendly locals and a burgeoning cultural scene that is currently producing some of the most exciting artists in Africa. Culturally, much of the action happens in the capital, Kampala, a hilly urban sprawl ringed by farmland and perched on the muddy banks of Lake Victoria. While most foreign travellers confine themselves to the city centre or the diplomatic quarter, Kololo, its worth venturing into the bustling bars and clubs of Kabalagala, where expats and locals meet for a slug of the local Nile beer and a friendly game of pool. Away from the capital, Uganda’s towns and cities have little in the way of diversions (although Jinja’s location on the banks of the River Nile has made it a favourite with thrill-seeking rafters). Instead, head west towards the Congo border where, along with the fascinating pygmy people of Fort Portal, Uganda’s natural wonders reveal themselves. A popular spot for wildlife watching is Queen Elizabeth National Park, which is home to four of the Big Five, a flock of flamboyant flamingos and the rare tree-climbing lions of Ishasha. The star attraction, though, is the iconic mountain gorilla, which can be found further south in Bwindi Impenetrable Forest. While you’re down there it’s also worth taking a detour to Lake Bunyonyi, a mountain retreat famed for its stunning vistas and freshwater crayfish. More natural wonders await in northern Uganda, home to the magnificent Murchison Falls, and in the east, where visitors will find the outstanding desert crags and ossified anthills of Kidepo. Regardless of where you go in Uganda, when it comes to leaving, it will be with a reluctant heavy heart. 241,038 sq km (93,072 sq miles). 41,487,965 (UN estimate 2016). 157.1 per sq km. Kampala. Republic. President Yoweri Kaguta Museveni since 1986. Prime Minister Robinah Nabbanja since 2021.","Before the arrival of Europeans in the 19th century, the Buganda Kingdom had become the ascendant dynasty in the region, having edged out other contenders with well-developed armed forces and agriculture. From the 1840s, Muslim traders entered the region from the Indian Ocean coast. In 1862, British explorer John Hanning Speke became the first European to visit the kingdom, soon followed by a number of Christian missionaries, who were welcomed by the Bugandan king, Mutesa. The territory, renamed Uganda, officially became a British protectorate in 1894. The country officially gained its independence from Britain in 1962, and most of its post-independence history has been characterised by politically inspired violence. President Obote, who banned opposition parties in 1969, was overthrown by the notorious and murderous Idi Amin, who remained in power until he was deposed by a joint force of Tanzanian forces and Ugandan exiles in 1979. Obote subsequently returned to office but he too found himself fighting guerrilla groups – the remnants of Amin's army and Yoweri Museveni's National Resistance Army (NRA). The third major military force in the country was the Uganda National Liberation Army (UNLA), led by Tito Okello. In July 1985, Obote was overthrown once again, this time by a military council with Okello at its head. The Okello government lasted just six months, and the NRA took control of the capital in 1986, establishing the National Resistance Council to govern the country. By the early 1990s, Museveni had succeeded in restoring order and a measure of prosperity to most of the country. Presidential elections, comfortably won by Museveni, were held in 1989. Museveni continues to hold the presidency today, having won subsequent elections in 1996, 2001, 2006 and 2011. For decades after Museveni came to power in 1986, two regions of northern Uganda, Gulu and Kitgum, continued to be embroiled in a civil war. This resulted in a civilian death toll of 10,000 people, most at the hands of the extremely violent Lord's Resistance Army (LRA), a quasi-religious anti-government outfit that terrorised the border regions of northern Uganda by deliberately targeting civilians. While the Ugandan army failed to formally end the war, the LRA hasn't been active in northern Uganda since 2005 and the region and its people have finally been able to join the rest of the country in a prolonged period of relative peace and stability. Did you know? • Winston Churchill dubbed Uganda the “Pearl of Africa” when he visited in 1907. • Uganda has repeatedly been ranked in the top 25% in alcohol consumption. • In 2016 nearly half of Uganda’s population were under the age of 14, making it the youngest country in the world after Niger. 84.5% Christian and 13.7% Muslim with the remaining being atheist, or belonging to traditional religions. There are tiny minorities that practice Hinduism and Judaism. Visitors to the country will generally find Ugandans to be warm, friendly and relaxed.Shaking hands is the normal form of greeting and it’s considered rude not to greet a person properly before rushing into asking them a question. Most people will know ‘Hello’, but the Swahili ‘Jambo’ is also used. Casual dress is usual for most occasions in the daytime or evening. Ugandans have adopted a socially conservative culture and expressing emotions or affection in public is best avoided. Expressing anger is also frowned on and generally counter-productive, so try and keep calm in frustrating situations.  Drug abuse is illegal and widely condemned, as is homosexuality. There has been much publicity in recent years regarding Uganda’s hardline approach to homosexuality, with the government proposing in 2009 – it was later overturned in 2014 – an Anti-Homosexuality Bill which would have included death penalties for anyone proved to be indulging in same-sex activities. While the bill provoked strong international condemnation, homosexuals in Uganda still regularly face persecution, outings in the media or through the church, eviction, arrests and violence. As such, any LGBTQ+ travellers to the country are advised to be extremely cautious. Photography: Since 1992, photography has been allowed in all areas with the exception of airports or military installations. However, some areas are still sensitive and it is advisable to take local advice. Commercial photographers should consult the Ministry of Information for a permit. If taking a photograph of people, ask their permission first. English is the official language, with Swahili, Luganda and other Bantu languages like Nyoro (by the Banyoro) and Tooro (by the Toro people) are also spoken.","Uganda has a warm tropical climate, with temperatures ranging from 25-29°C (77- 84°F), apart from in the mountainous areas, which are much cooler; the top of Mount Elgon is often covered with snow. The hottest months are December to February. Evenings can feel chilly after the heat of the day with temperatures around 17- 18ºC (63-64°F). Most regions of Uganda, apart from the dry area in the north, have an annual rainfall of between 1,000mm and 1,500mm. There is heavy rain between March and May and between September and November, making road travel difficult in parts of the country. The best time for trekking is during the dry seasons, between January and February and June to August. Wildlife viewing is best at the end of the dry seasons, when game is more concentrated around water sources.   Lightweight clothes with a warm cover-up for the evenings are advised. Short or revealing clothes should be avoided - women should avoid shorts in particular. Knee-length skirts or dresses are more acceptable. Take a pair of good walking shoes or boots for forest trekking, and long-sleeved tops to protect against mosquitoes. If you’re planning to go to mountainous areas, be sure to take warm clothing, as temperatures drop substantially. White clothes won’t stay white for long with Uganda’s red dust roads, so go for darker colours. Travellers can also pick up bargains at second-hand clothes markets in Kampala, Jinja and Fort Portal, which sell trousers, boots and fleeces. Landlocked, Uganda lies between the eastern and western sections of Africa’s Great Rift Valley. The country shares borders with South Sudan to the north, Kenya to the east, Lake Victoria to the southeast, Tanzania and Rwanda to the south and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) to the west. Whilst the landscape is generally quite flat, most of the country is over 1,000m (3,280ft) in altitude. Mountainous regions include the Rwenzori Mountains that run along the border with the DRC, the Virunga Mountains on the border with Rwanda and the DRC, and Kigezi in the southwest of the country. An extinct volcano, Mount Elgon, straddles the border with Kenya. The capital city, Kampala, lies on the shores of Lake Victoria, the largest lake in Africa and second-largest freshwater inland body of water in the world. Jinja, located on the lake, is considered to be the start point of the River Nile, which traverses much of the country. The varied scenery includes tropical forest, a semi-desert area in the northeast, the arid plains of the Karamoja, the lush, heavily populated Buganda, the rolling savannah of Acholi, Bunyoro, Tororo and Ankole, tea plantations and the fertile cotton area of Teso."
africa,zambia,"Vast lakes and wetlands, long and life-giving rivers, breathtaking African sunsets and a rich tradition of guiding all contribute to Zambia’s immense appeal as a safari destination. Its most famous landmark, Victoria Falls, which it shares with Zimbabwe, attracts nature lovers and thrill-seekers alike. Visit in March or April, when the falls are in full spate, and you’ll be bowled over by the rainbows, the roar of the cascading water and the dense, drenching clouds of spray. Livingstone, the closest urban hub to the falls and once Zambia’s colonial capital, has a number of accommodation options, colourful markets and a busy restaurant and nightlife scene. The mighty Zambezi River itself is glassy-smooth above the falls and wild below. It’s perfect for booze cruises, canoe safaris and adrenaline activities such as white-water rafting and river surfing. There are a plethora of beautiful riverside lodges dotted along its banks. Beyond the falls, Zambia is not as high-profile a safari destination as Kenya, Tanzania or South Africa, but it’s a favourite with those in the know. Packed with untamed wilderness and fascinating wildlife, minus the crowds, Zambia is the African bush at its most raw and romantic. The country’s excellent safari lodges and camps will put you fully in touch with your wild surroundings. You’ll fall asleep to the hooting of owls, the whooping of hyenas, the distant roar of lions, and the loud munching of hippos grazing nearby. Almost a third of Zambia’s landmass is given over to national parks and game reserves, but South Luangwa National Park is the cream of the crop for sheer density of big game. It’s also the home of the legendary African walking safari. Another of Zambia’s drawcards is the people. The country is home to a staggering 72 different ethnic groups, each of whom have their own distinctive cultural traits and traditions, but all of whom are unfailingly warm and welcoming. 752,614 sq km (290,586 sq miles). 16,717,332 (UN estimate 2016). 20 per sq km. Lusaka. Republic. President Hakainde Hichilema since 2021.","The original inhabitants of Zambia were nomadic San hunter-gatherers. The first people to introduce agriculture and copper mining were Bantu settlers who started arriving in the 4th century. In 1855, Dr David Livingstone became the first British explorer to visit Zambia and ‘discovered’ the Victoria Falls (so-named in honour of Queen Victoria) on his famous exploration of the Zambezi River. The town of Livingstone was later named after him, and would serve as the capital for a time. Cecil Rhodes and the British South African Company colonised Zambia in 1889, then in 1924 the company ceded administrative control to the British Crown, whereupon it became the colony of Northern Rhodesia and serious European exploitation of Zambia’s main natural resource, copper, began. The colonial authorities ceded independence in 1964 and the country was re-named Zambia. The pre-independence elections were won by Kenneth Kaunda's United National Independence Party. Zambia soon became involved in the war in Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe). Kaunda closed the southern border and gave safe haven to cadres from Joshua Nkomo's ZAPU party and its associated guerrilla army, ZIPRA. Relations with the Zimbabweans improved after Zimbabwe became independent in 1980 and Kaunda's foreign policy focused elsewhere. However, a decline in global copper prices caused economic decline in Zambia throughout the 1980s and 1990s. Meanwhile, Kaunda became a major regional statesman. He played a significant part in the initiatives leading to independence in Namibia and South Africa and, in the 1990s, chaired both the Organisation of African Unity and the 'front-line' group of Southern African states confronting the South African apartheid regime. During 1990, domestic unrest, sparked by price rises, developed into demands for a more democratic system of government. The principal opposition, the Movement for Multi-party Democracy (MMD) led by Frederick Chiluba, won a substantial majority in the ensuing 1991 election, which marked an end to single-party rule. In the years since, Zambia’s inherently peaceful democracy has prevailed despite the occasional scare. In January 2015, Edward Lungu became the latest Zambian president, after his predecessor Michael Sata died in office. Did you know? • Iron and copper have been mined in Zambia for over 2,000 years. • Zambia’s is one Africa’s most urbanized countries. • In 2015, the Global Peace Index rated Zambia the most peaceful country in Africa. Around 30% of the population is Christian (Protestant and Roman Catholic), a smaller number are Muslim and Hindu, and a small minority have traditional animist beliefs. Zambian culture, traditions and folklore remain prominent and long-standing tribal customs and crafts are practised throughout the country, particularly in the rural areas. These include rituals and ceremonies to mark rites of passage such as coming-of-age or marriage, and colourful annual festivals to commemorate revered ancestors celebrate the changing seasons. Most Zambian festivals feature traditional music, drumming and dancing. Visitors to the more remote rural areas should expect to be met with curiosity. Shaking hands is the normal form of greeting. Gifts are often offered to visitors as a sign of gratitude, friendship or honour. One should never refuse a gift but accept it with both hands. Same-sex sexual activity is illegal for both males and females in Zambia and social attitudes towards LGBT people are mostly negative. English, Bemba, Nyanja, Tonga, Lozi, Lunda, Kaonde and Luvale are the official languages. Zambia also has over 70 local dialects.","Although Zambia lies in the tropics, the height of the plateau ensures that the climate is seldom unpleasantly hot, except in the valleys. There are three seasons: the cool, dry winter season from May to September; the hot, dry season in October and November; and the rainy season, which is even hotter, from December to April. Lightweights or tropical with rainwear. Zambia is a vast, land-locked tropical plateau in southern Africa bordered by Angola to the west, the Democratic Republic of Congo to the north, Tanzania to the northeast, Malawi to the east, Mozambique to the southeast, Zimbabwe and Botswana to the south and the Caprivi Strip of Namibia to the southwest. The Zambezi River, together with Lake Kariba, forms the frontier with Zimbabwe and lies at Zambia’s lowest point in altitude. Victoria Falls, formed by the Zambezi tumbling over a cliff into the Batoka Gorge, is one of the most spectacular sights in Africa (if not the world). Lake Kariba, which was created by the construction of the Kariba Dam in the 1950s, is the world’s largest reservoir by volume. The Zambian capital, Lusaka, lies roughly in the centre of the country, a region of thinly wooded bush. In the east and northeast, the country rises to a plateau 1,200m (3,937ft) high, covered by deciduous savannah, small trees, grassy plains or marshland. In central Zambia, South Luangwa National Park, east of Lusaka, and Kafue National Park, west of Lusaka, are magnificent expanses of riverside grassland, woodland and forest with some of the densest and most diverse populations of wild animals in Africa."
africa,zimbabwe,"After a difficult decade or so, stability is returning to Zimbabwe and pioneering tourists are gradually trickling back to the country. They are richly rewarded for their endeavours: with its abundance of natural wonders, welcoming locals, fascinating heritage and good climate, Zimbabwe is one of the most remarkable countries in Africa. The jewel in its glistening crown is Victoria Falls. Straddling the border between Zimbabwe and neighbouring Zambia, this waterfall is officially the largest on the planet and hearing the roar of all that cascading water makes for an unforgettable experience. As well as awe-inspiring natural spectacles, Zimbabwe offers some of the best wildlife in southern Africa. From the forested mountains of the Eastern Highlands to the sun-washed grasslands of Hwange National Park, the country is teeming with flora and fauna, including the Big 5 (elephant, rhino, leopard, buffalo and lion). Roughly 11% of Zimbabwe's land has been set aside for parks and wildlife estates, but it can do big cities too. The two most populous are Harare and Bulawayo, which serve up an impressive selection of cultural attractions, hip bars and fine dining restaurants. Between these two urban hubs lie the astonishing late Iron Age stone ruins at Great Zimbabwe, which shoot down theories that sub-Saharan Africa had no great civilizations. It’s not all smooth sailing, though. Whilst Zimbabwe’s fragile economy is slowly improving, there is still widespread poverty and the government lacks the resources to deal with the ravages of the HIV pandemic, which affects an estimated one in four people here. Corruption is rife too, and roadblocks manned by officials looking for any excuse to fleece you can hinder cross-country travel. But for the most part Zimbabwe remains a peaceful place full of peaceful people, who desperately need tourism to help build a better future for this incredible corner of Africa. 390,757 sq km (150,872 sq miles). 15,966,810 (UN estimate 2016). 36.4 per sq km. Harare. Republic. President Emmerson Mnangagwa since November 2017.","Present-day Zimbabwe was the site of a large and complex African civilisation in the 13th and 14th centuries. It was populated by descendants of the Bantu tribes, who had migrated from the north around the 10th century. Evidence of their mainly pastoral lifestyle may still be seen in the ruins of Great Zimbabwe, near the town of Masvingo. The first contact with Europeans was with the Portuguese at the end of the 15th century. Relations between the two were fairly stable until the 1830s, when the region was thrown into upheaval by the northward migration of the Ndebele people from South Africa. At this point, a new aggressive breed of colonists arrived in the form of British mining interests led by Cecil Rhodes's British South Africa Company (BSAC). The BSAC took control of the country – which they called ‘Southern Rhodesia' – until 1923, when it became, nominally, a British colony. Between 1953 and 1963, Southern Rhodesia formed part of the Central African Federation with neighbouring Northern Rhodesia (now Zambia) and Nyasaland (now Malawi). In 1965, to resist decolonisation, the settlers – with South African support – issued a Unilateral Declaration of Independence (UDI). This triggered a bitter civil war between the white minority government and fighters for African independence, ending only in 1980, with the granting of independence and the holding of a general election under British auspices, which was won decisively by Robert Mugabe's ZANU party. Modern Zimbabwe has seen its fair share of suffering and instability. The economy all but collapsed in the wake of the forced and often violent removal of farmers during a violent land redistribution programme. Still today, there is widespread famine, which has been cynically manipulated by the government so that opposition strongholds suffer the most. The government lacks the resources or machinery to deal with the ravages of the AIDS pandemic, which affects roughly a quarter of the population. All of the above has provided fodder for increasing international scorn towards the aging and dictatorial President Mugabe, who was previously considered a great liberation hero. A historic power-sharing deal signed in 2008 between President Mugabe and Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) leader Morgan Tsvangirai put an end to pre-election violence and pledged to improve the country’s economy and the lives of Zimbabweans. It has since ushered in a new spell of peace and relative stability that has seen tourists slowly coming back to Zimbabwe. Did you know? • In 2008, Zimbabwe recorded a monthly inflation rate rise of roughly 96.6 billion %. • Robert Mugabe is the world’s oldest living head of state. He is 91. • Contrastingly, Zimbabwe’s life expectancy is around 41 years old, almost the lowest in the world.

Urban culture in Zimbabwe is greatly influenced by Western culture and education but, in rural areas, traditional values and crafts continue. Shaking hands is the customary form of greeting. European courtesies and codes of practice should be observed when visiting someone's home. Return invitations are appreciated. Giving a token of appreciation is optional. It is an offence to make derogatory or insulting comments about President Mugabe. Visitors should be aware that an open hand is the political symbol of the main opposition political party, the Movement for Democratic Change, and that a friendly wave may therefore be interpreted as a provocative political gesture. Casual wear is suitable for daytime and men are only expected to wear suits and ties for business meetings. Smart restaurants or hotel bars require male guests to wear a jacket and tie. Smoking is common, although it is prohibited on public transport and in some public buildings.

The highveld landscape is dotted with kopjes (massive granite outcrops). Along the eastern border for some 350km (220 miles) is a high mountainous region of great scenic beauty, rising to 2,592m (8,504ft) at Mount Inyangani, the country's highest point."
antarctica,antarctica,"Amidst the solitude of Antarctica, adventurous travellers can discover an ethereal landscape that lingers in the memory. Very few have ventured onto this appealingly inaccessible continent, but those who have rave about the privilege of gazing upon towering mountains, bulky glaciers and luminous, dreamlike icebergs. Perhaps more than anywhere else, Antarctica reminds those who visit it of the awesome (and savage) power of nature. Antarctica is welcoming more tourist-orientated cruises and ferries to the region every year, and facilities are continually developing, with more accommodation, culinary and travel options available. There is now ample opportunity to ascend Mount Erebus, the southernmost active volcano on Earth; to fly via helicopter or venture by boat to penguin colonies; and to really make the most of a terrain that teems with wildlife, with a multitude of birds, seals, albatrosses and enormous whales. Some argue that Antarctica is changing, and by man-made causes rather than natural ones. Many regard the increasing focus on tourism as disconcerting and wish to preserve Antarctica in its elemental state to avoid any potential environmental damage. Antarctica is still a magical experience that most, given the chance, would find hard to resist. Those who do visit should be aware of their impact upon the landscape and do their utmost to limit the effect of their stay. Perhaps the reason behind the fascination with Antarctica is its function as a symbol of endurance and survival. Before Antarctica was first spotted (in 1819), the continent was the subject of constant speculation, spoken of in almost mythical terms as Terra Australia Incognita (The Unknown Southern Land). Humans first occupied the continent in 1899, but Antarctica seemed inhospitable and incomprehensible and, in many ways, it still is. 14,000,000 sq km (5,405,430 sq miles). 0. Antarctica has no government and is regulated under the Antarctic Treaty System.","Antarctica is the coldest, driest (its annual rainfall is comparable to that of desert regions) and windiest continent on Earth. It also has the highest elevation. The main human activity undertaken in Antarctica is scientific research and it was at the British Halley research station that the hole in the ozone layer was discovered in 1985. It was this discovery, perhaps more than any other event, bar nuclear accidents, to bring ecology to prominence in the international political agenda. The constitutional position of Antarctica is governed by the terms of the Antarctic Treaty of 1959, which came into effect in 1961 and was signed initially by Argentina, Australia, Chile, France, New Zealand, Norway, the UK, Belgium, Japan, South Africa, the USA and Russia. The first seven of these countries have historic claims to the ice-bound continent (none of which were, or are, generally recognised) and the Treaty preserves the status quo, neither recognising nor rejecting the old claims, but forbidding their expansion in any way. The terms of the Treaty also forbid, absolutely, the assertion of new claims. The Treaty applies to all land and ice shelves below 60º South. A further 38 countries have since signed the treaty. In May 1994, the International Whaling Commission agreed to the creation of a whale sanctuary around Antarctica below 40º South. In May 1997, it was suggested by the World Meteorological Organisation that the long-term outlook for the ozone layer over the Antarctic was improving, although it will take some years for this to be conclusively proved. Even depending on a significant reduction of CFCs and other harmful emissions, it is unlikely that the hole will repair itself permanently (if, indeed, it does at all) before 2060 at the earliest. Antarctica's first zero-emission research station, Princess Elisabeth, opened in 2009 and runs solely on renewable energy. Did you know? • Norwegian explorer Roald Amundsen lead the first expedition to reach the South Pole, on 14 December 1911 a month before the doomed British expedition led by Robert Falcon Scott. • Mount Erebus on Ross Island in the world's southernmost active volcano and was the scene of the crash of a New Zealand sightseeing flight in 1979 that killed all 257 people on board. • There are no indigenous peoples associated with Antarctica, but it is reckoned there is a working population of about a thousand researchers and technicians during winter months, rising to as many as 5000 in the summer.","It is imperative to wrap up warm in Antarctica given its sub-zero temperatures. Required clothing is a mix of foundation or base layer clothing (thermal tops, thermal trousers, gloves, socks), insulating layer clothing (fleeced tops, woollen sweatshirts, jackets, trousers) and outer or shell layer clothing (waterproof and windproof trousers, jackets, mittens and gloves). Scarves, insulating head gear, waterproof and insulated boots, goggles and sunglasses are also essential items. Antarctica is the largest remaining wilderness on Earth and is still relatively untouched by human impact. It covers an area of 14 million sq km (5.4 million sq miles) around the South Pole and is covered with an ice sheet 4km (2.5 miles) deep. It has no permanent human population other than a small number of personnel at over 60 research stations run by 30 different nations. Antarctica is the coldest and windiest continent."
asia,afghanistan,"An essential stop on the hippie trail in the 1960s, beautiful Afghanistan has been devastated by years of war. Renowned for its epic countryside and rugged mountains, travellers came to interact with local communities, breathe clear mountain air and explore ancient sites such as the giant Buddha statues of Bamiyan. They were happy times. Sadly, those days are gone. The Taliban destroyed most of the country’s monuments, while the US and its allies ruined what was left of Afghanistan’s creaking infrastructure. With thousands of peacekeeping troops still operating in the country and pockets of fighting continuing, it will be some time before Afghanistan is restored to its former glory. Consequently, travellers are advised against visiting Afghanistan. Nevertheless, some adventurous tour companies are offering trips to the country, and there have been reports in some quarters of increased bookings and interest. Afghan authorities put tourist numbers at less than 20,000, though they claim it is slowly increasing. Tending to take in the historic but war-ravaged city of Kabul, mountain villages, ancient fortifications and some surviving Buddhist sites, tours are generally conducted in small groups and tend to be expensive. Guides make the point that for many ordinary Afghans, life has continued much the same as it has for centuries. Indeed of the few travellers that do make it to the country, they tell of the surprising normality of Kabul, with little signs of the instability reported by international media. The country also remains a fascinating melting pot of ethnic and tribal groups. Despite hopes that tourism could return to this historic country, almost every area of Afghanistan remains dangerous as insurgents continue to threaten the fragile democracy. If you do decide to travel to Afghanistan, personal security is recommended, as is a reputable tour company and full travel insurance.

Head of government: Mullah Mohammad Hassan Akhund, since September 2021.","Important ancient kingdoms of Afghanistan include the Median and Achaemenid Empires. In the 4th century BC Alexander the Great reached the country, leaving behind a Hellenic legacy that would linger for centuries. The Kushan Empire from the 1st to the 3rd centuries AD found Afghanistan at perhaps its ancient peak, expanding through India, and Hinduism and Buddhism became prominent in the country. That was until the 7th century, when Islam reached the country. Although Arab armies made inroads into the country, full-scale conquest was difficult due to the resilience of mountain tribes. Genghis Khan and Timur were successful conquerors, in the 13th and 14th centuries respectively, while Babur, a descendant of Timur, used Kabul as a base to conquer much of India in the 16th century. The Persians also held sway for a time, until in the 18th century an Afghan tribal leader called Ahmad Shah united much of present-day Afghanistan. For nearly a century starting in 1838, Britain attempted to control Afghanistan, but in 1919, the country declared independence. By the 1950s, the Afghan government was courting economic and military assistance form the Soviet Union. In 1963, a constitutional monarchy was declared, leading to destabilising power struggles, then a republic was declared after a coup by Mohammed Daud. The Soviets, however, had other ideas, and ousted him in what became a proxy struggle of the Cold War. As the Soviet Union attempted to strengthen the new regime, the US-backed Mujahedeen destabilised the country, leading to the Soviet invasion of 1979. By 1985, half of the country's population was displaced by war. Although a peace treaty was signed in 1988, the 1990s saw the civil war continue. In 1996, the Taliban seized control of Kabul and much of the country. Then, following 9/11, the US invaded Afghanistan. Elections followed the ousting of the Taliban, but the country remains highly unstable, with whole regions still controlled by warlords. The US has technically withdrawn military forces, but a large number of personnel remain to support the Afghan army and security services. Did you know? • Human civilisation in Afghanistan dates at least as far back as 4000 BC. • The territory has always been an important link between the Middle East and civilisations in India, Central and Eastern Asia, making it the victim of various conquering armies. • In May 2015, representatives from the Taliban and the Afghan government held informal talks. Islamic majority with 89% Sunni Muslims, 9% Shi'ite, and Hindu and Sikh minorities. Outside Kabul, Afghanistan is still very much a tribal society. Religion and traditional customs have a strong influence within the family, and there are strict male and female roles in society. It is considered insulting to show the soles of the feet. Women are advised to wear trousers or long skirts and avoid revealing clothing. Homosexuality is illegal, as is alcohol, narcotics and pork products. Handshaking is an acceptable form of greeting, though nose-rubbing and embracing are more traditional. Eye contact between men and women should be avoided.Photography: Care should be taken when using cameras. Military installations should not be photographed. The principal languages are Pashto and Dari Persian. Some English and Russian may also be spoken.","Although occupying the same latitudes as South-Central USA, the mountainous nature of much of Afghanistan produces a far colder climate. Being landlocked, there are considerable differences in temperature between summer and winter, and day and night in lowland regions and in the valleys; the southern lowlands in particular have intensely hot summers and harsh winters. Spring and autumn are the most hospitable times to visit: April-June, and September-October. Landlocked Afghanistan shares its borders with Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Tajikstan to the north, China to the northeast, Pakistan to the east and south and Iran to the west. On the eastern tip of the Iranian plateau, central Afghanistan is made up of a tangled mass of mountain chains. The Hindu Kush is the highest range, rising to more than 7,500m (24,600ft). The Bamian Valley separates the Hindu Kush from Koh-i-Baba, the central mountain range and source of the Helmand River. To the north and southwest of these mountains, alluvial plains provide fertile agricultural soil. To the northeast is Kabul, the capital; the other major cities are Jalalabad, Kandahar, Mazar-i-Sharif and Herat."
asia,azerbaijan,"The original 'East-meets-West' destination, Azerbaijan sashays between space-age cityscapes and Arabian Nights exotica, taking in some of the most extraordinary landscapes in Caucasia en route. Sitting at the crossroads between Europe and Asia, this former Soviet Republic is marginally bigger than Ireland, yet boasts an astonishing variety of natural wonders – from snow-capped mountains and bubbling mud volcanoes to sandy deserts and subtropical forests. The northern hinterland is arguably the prettiest region thanks to the Caucasus Mountains, which rise to the misty heights of 4,466m (14,652ft). These lofty peaks are home to bears, wolves and leopards, not to mention nomadic shepherds, who move their flocks up and down these mountains in search of fresh pastures as they have done for thousands of year. Meanwhile, along the boulevards of downtown Baku, nouveau riche residents butterfly between expensive boutiques. The capital's exclusive shops, modern architecture and luxury hotels – spoils of Caspian Sea oil – jar somewhat with the UNESCO old town. Though oil has transformed the economy in recent years, Azerbaijan has always been of strategic importance. Nestling on the shores of the Caspian Sea, the camel caravans of the Silk Road once passed through the land, which, over the centuries, has been incorporated into the Persian, Turkish and Russian empires. Today Azerbaijan is a sovereign state and, although Islamic, the mood is determinedly secular. Alcohol is not only readily available, but proudly produced. Grapes have been cultivated here for millennia and local vineyards develop some excellent wines. Azeri cuisine is also enjoying a renaissance thanks a profusion of new eateries popping up in downtown Baku. 86,600 sq km (33,400 sq miles). 9,915,179 (UN estimate 2016). 112.9 per sq km. Baku. Republic. President Ilham Aliyev since 2003. Prime Minister Ali Asadov since 2019.","Over the centuries, Azerbaijan has enjoyed only brief periods of independent statehood, in between longer periods spent incorporated into major regional empires. Amongst the first to arrive were the Arabs, who marched into The Caucasus in the 7th century and established Islam as the predominant religion. They were followed by the Seljuk Turks who, by the 11th century, had leveraged their growing influence on the region and made Turkish the main language in the territory. Thereafter, Azerbaijan was influenced by both the Ottoman Turks, lying on the border of their empire, and the Iranians, from whom they acquired an adherence to the Shia branch of Islam. In 1812, the Russians, in the course of their march southwards, took over the northern part of Azerbaijan; the southern part remained a province of Iran. A series of wars ensued between the two powers, from which Russia emerged victorious. But then came WWI, which, in 1917, brought about the collapse of the Russian Empire and, consequently, Azerbaijan's freedom. The years that followed were prosperous for the young nation. A Caspian Sea oil boom brought great wealth to the country and transformed its capital, Baku, into an industrial centre. But this golden era was short lived. In 1920 the Russians returned, marching into oil-rich Azerbaijan to establish a puppet state known as the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic. The most prominent politician to emerge during the Soviet period was Heydar Aliyev, successively head of the Azerbaijan KGB, leader of the Republic itself, and then a full member of the Soviet Politburo. He would play a decisive role in post-Soviet Azerbaijan, the seeds of which were sewn when the Soviet Union crumbled towards the end of the 1980s. During this time the issue of Nagorno-Karabakh – an autonomous enclave inside Azeri territory with an overwhelming Armenian majority – proved critical to Azerbaijan's political development. Serious internal problems and a failure to make any progress on Karabakh led to a military coup and paved the way for the return of Heydar Aliyev. He succeeded in tackling the two most pressing issues: stabilising the political situation in the country and negotiating a truce in the Nagorno-Karabakh War. The 1994 settlement in Nagorno-Karabakh did not favour the Azeris, although they continue to make vigorous diplomatic efforts to address the status of the territory. Aliyev was twice re-elected by huge majorities. Elections in November 2000 gave the party two-thirds of the parliamentary seats. Ilham Aliyev inherited his father's office in 2003, through an election the international community widely believed to be unfair. While Azerbaijan remains a stable country, it is still mired in corruption, and continues to be a dictatorship in all but name with widespread human rights abuses. Did you know? • Hitler said that if he couldn't take over the Baku oilfields, the war would be lost. The German army was on its way there when they were defeated by the Russians in the battle of Stalingrad in 1943. • The name of Azerbaijan’s 'exclave' in Armenian territory, Nakhchivan, means Noah's Colony. Azeris believe survivors of the Great Flood settled here. • Azerbaijan was the first Muslim country in the world to offer universal suffrage, giving women the vote in 1918. Mostly Shia Muslim although there are Russian Orthodox and Jewish communities. Foreign women should dress modestly, especially in the rural areas, and cultivate a certain coolness of manner. Both men and women should avoid wearing shorts as this will attract unwelcome attention. Although mostly Muslim in population, Azerbaijan is a largely secular society that views religion as a private matter. Handshaking is the normal form of greeting. Business cards are invariably exchanged at any kind of official meeting, and not infrequently on first meeting socially as well. It's always a good idea to give gifts to people you meet, business contacts. Flowers, post-cards, picture books and alcohol make excellent presents. Azeri. Russian is widely spoken; English may be spoken in Baku and other main centres.","The best time to visit Azerbaijan is during spring (March-June) when the weather is warm and the foliage is in full bloom. The summer months (July-September) can be oppressively hot and humid, particularly in the capital, Baku, but they are also the best months to go hiking in the mountains. Although temperatures along the Caspian coastline remain mild throughout winter (November-February), the mercury dip well below freezing further inland. The mountains at this time of the year are covered in snow and very treacherous. Though downpours do occur throughout the country, most of the rainfall is confined to the west. Light-weight clothing is fine for low-lying destination in the summer months, but coats and sweaters are advised at other times. Bring warm clothing if you are heading to the mountains, which remain chilly throughout the year. Azerbaijan is bordered by the Russian Federation, Georgia, Iran and Armenia. Much of Southwestern Azerbaijan in the ethnically Armenian region of Nagorno-Karabakh is occupied by Armenian forces following the Armenia-Azerbaijan war (1988-1994). Azerbaijan also includes the exclave of Nakhchivan, which is located between Turkey, Iran and Armenia."
asia,bangladesh,"India’s sleepy eastern cousin, Bangladesh slumbers gently under monsoon skies at the mouth of the Jamuna River, one of the world’s great deltas. Formerly East Pakistan, this intriguing backwater gained independence in 1971 after a civil war that still plays a major role in the national psyche. An influx of tourists was predicted following independence, but this has yet to materialised, meaning visitors have Bangladesh’s many and varied attractions to themselves. Those attractions range from Mughal palaces and gleaming mosques to palm-fringed beaches, tea-plantations and jungles full of snarling Bengal tigers. Bangladesh’s frenetic capital, Dhaka, was once the main port for the whole of Bengal, and its rickshaw-crammed streets present a faded mirror to Kolkata across the border. Dhaka is a city of rain-washed colonial buildings, gaudy film posters, docksides thronging with boats and the constant cacophony of car horns and rickshaw bells. It can be a shock for the senses, but the blow is softened by friendly, inquisitive locals and delicious Bengali cuisine. South of Dhaka, the Jamuna River breaks down into a tangle of jungle-choked waterways as you enter the Sundarbans, one of the last refuges of the Bengal tiger. Here, as elsewhere in Bangladesh, the best way to get around is by river – legions of boats ply every waterway, from tiny coracles to the paddleboat ‘rockets’ that chug between Dhaka and Kulna. The south of Bangladesh is something else again; tropical beaches give way to forested hills that hide a host of Buddhist and animist tribes. Then there’s Sylhet, in the heart of tea plantation country, where foreign remittances have built a miniature version of England amidst the monsoon hills. Above all else, Bangladesh is place to leave the mainstream travel map. Let the crowds mob the beaches of Goa and the forts of Rajasthan; in Bangladesh, you won’t have to queue to be amazed. 143,998 sq km (55,598 sq miles). 162,910,864 (UN estimate 2016). 1,173.3 per sq km. Dhaka. Republic. President Mohammad Shahabuddin Chuppu since 2023. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina Wajed since 2009.","In ancient history, Bangladesh was ruled by a succession of animist, Buddhist and Hindu empires, including the Pala dynasty in the 8th century, whose kings constructed the vast monastic complex at Paharpur. Hinduism experienced a major revival under the Sena dynasty in the 12th century, but it was soon replaced by Islam, introduced first by Arab traders and Sufi missionaries, and later by conquering armies sent east by the Muslim sultans of the Indian plains. Successive Muslim dynasties established rival capitals across the country before the Mughals cemented control in 1575, and developed Dhaka as the capital of the province of Bengal. When the British arrived in the 18th century, Mughal control of Bengal had waned and power was devolved to wealthy local families – the nawabs. The British East India Company gained ownership of Bengal after the Battle of Plassey in 1757, ruling by proxy through allegiances with powerful nawabs. The division of Bengal into Hindu and Muslim enclaves by the British in 1905 sowed the seeds of rebellion against colonial rule. The Bengal region was divided in 1947 along religious lines in what was known as the Partition of India, which saw predominately-Hindu West Bengal become a province of India and predominately-Muslim East Bengal become a province of Pakistan, known as East Pakistan. In the years that followed, the independence movement gathered pace and Bengal continued to be marginalised. Disputes over language and political power came to a head in 1970, when the pro-independence Awami League won an overwhelming majority and West Pakistan sent its armies to suppress the east, plunging the country into civil war. India intervened in 1971 on the side of East Pakistan, but by then perhaps three million Bengalis had been killed by Pakistani forces. Bangladesh formally came into being on 17 December 1971, but weak governments provided the opportunity for a string of military takeovers. Democracy was finally restored in 1991. Since then, Bangladesh has faced severe challenges: from the devastating 2004 tsunami to a succession of severe cyclones that have flooded large parts of the country. Today, Bangladesh is regarded as one of the nations most vulnerable to the effects of climate change. Did you know? •	The Bengal tiger is Bangladesh’s national animal, but it’s an endangered species with only 440 individuals thought to live in the country. •	Bangladesh officially has six seasons: summer, rainy, autumn, cool, winter and spring. •	In Bangladesh, smiling is considered by some people to be a sign of immaturity. 90% Muslim, 9% Hindus and 1% Buddhist and Christian minorities.

asia,bhutan,"Closed to the outside world until the seventies, Bhutan may have opened the door to tourism, but it remains something of an enigma to modern travellers. Nestling high up in the Himalayas, Bhutan's mysterious reputation is thanks largely to the government, which requires all visitors to join pre-planned guided tours in a bid to limit the impact of tourism on the country's culture and environment. On one level, this is restrictive; footloose, freewheeling, make-it-up-as-you-go trips are not an option here. The trade-off, however, is that these restrictions have preserved one of the most fascinating cultures on earth, in a pristine mountain environment that has changed little over the centuries. To visit Bhutan every visitor, whether alone or in a group, must make all their travel arrangements through a Bhutanese tour operator, or associated organisation, and pay a fixed daily fee of US$200-250. However, before you baulk, this fee includes all meals, accommodation, transport and guides. Having made this investment, travellers are then free to explore this mesmerising mountain kingdom, known to its people as Druk Yul, or ""Land of the Thunder Dragon."" Some tour the ancient dzongs (fortress monasteries) in the valleys surrounding the capital, Thimphu. Others seek out snow leopards and yetis – known here as migyur – in remote national parks. Those with the stamina and budget take on the legendary Snowman Trek, a 24-day odyssey over high Himalayan passes.Wherever they go, visitors will encounter exquisite scenery and the famously friendly Bhutanese people, who, though fascinated by foreigners, remain in touch with the value, and values, of their traditional way of life. By subscribing to a ""high value, low impact"" brand of tourism, Bhutan has made concessions to the modern world, but on its own terms. And that seems to be working for this magical kingdom, which regularly polls as the happiest place in Asia. 38,364 per sq km (14,812 sq miles). 784,103 (UN estimate 2016). 19.3 per sq km. Thimphu. Constitutional monarchy. King Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck since 2006. Prime Minister Lyonchhen Tshering Tobgay since 2024.","The ancient history of Bhutan is shrouded in mystery, as few records survive, but early Tibetan manuscripts talk of states called Monyul and Lhomon in the area now covered by Bhutan. The Buddhist history of Bhutan is known with more certainty as a written history was maintained after Mahayana Buddhism was introduced into the country in the 7th century by the Tibetan king Songtsen Gampo. Widespread conversion to Buddhism followed some time after. According to local legend, the Indian ascetic Guru Rinpoche (Padmasambhava) converted the Bhutanese people after subduing eight classes of demons and converting the local king. For the next thousand years, Bhutan existed as a series of rival monarchies in separate mountain valleys. Bhutan first became a coherent political entity around the 17th century as Tibetan lamas established a centralised administrative and political structure over the area. Bhutan was officially unified under Ngawang Namgyal, who subdued rival Buddhist sects and founded the first of Bhutan’s dzongs (fortress monasteries). Amazingly, Namgyal’s death in 1651 was kept secret for 54 years to prevent the kingdom from fragmenting. His heirs ruled Bhutan until the 18th century, when the British Empire started nibbling away at its southern borders, seizing Bhutanese territory and imposing tithes on the Bhutanese rulers. In 1907, the Tibetan diarchal system, with power split between equal political and spiritual leaders, was abandoned and a hereditary monarchy was established, with Ugyen Wangchuck elected as the first Druk Gyalpo (Dragon King). His successors introduced some elements of modern government, but it was only when Jigme Dorji came to power in 1952 that Bhutan modernised in any meaningful way. Tourism to Bhutan began in 1974, after the Bhutanese government agreed to open its formerly restricted territory to outside visitors. In 1991, Bhutan’s policy of a daily tourist fee was introduced, allowing visits only on organised trips arranged through local agencies, to protect Bhutan’s traditional culture from outside influences. Bhutan is still nominally a monarchy, governed by the 5th Druk Gyalpo, Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck, but an elected parliament makes most decisions. The move to democracy was not without problems, and many refugees fled to Nepal in the 1990s, where they continue to live in a legal limbo. Bhutan has also become entangled in conflicts between Assamese and Bodo separatist guerrillas and the government of India. Did you know? •	Rather than measuring prosperity in GDP (Gross Domestic Profit), Bhutan measures prosperity by the happiness of its people, or GDH (Gross Domestic Happiness). •	The Bhutan constitution requires 60% of the country to remain under forest cover. •	Bhutan was the first country in the world to recognise the rights of the environment in its constitution. The Tantric form of Mahayana Buddhism (Drukpa Kagyu) is the state religion; the majority of Bhutanese people follow the Drukpa school of the Kagyupa sect. Those living in the south are mainly Hindu. The lifestyle, manners and customs of the Bhutanese are in many respects unique to the area. The strongest influence on social conventions is the country's state religion, and everywhere one can see the reminders of Buddhism and the original religion of Tibet, Bonism. There are no rigid clan systems and equal rights exist between men and women. The majority of the Bhutanese live an agrarian lifestyle. In 1989, it was made compulsory for citizens to wear national dress and failure to comply at official functions or in government buildings incurs a fine; the men wear a gho, a robe resembling a dressing gown with upturned white cuffs and knee-high socks, whilst the women wear a kira, a sari-like garment that is furnished with ornate brooches, and worn over a blouse. Bhutan has outlawed the sale of tobacco products, and also banned smoking in public places. Healthcare and education are free. The political leaders of the country have also been religious leaders historically. For years the country has deliberately isolated itself from visitors, a policy which is now to some extent being reversed. But Bhutan continues to bear the hallmarks of seemingly peculiar customs borne from legacy and legend. Giant phalluses can often be seen painted onto walls, etc, in order to ward off evil spirits and ensure good crops and healthy children. Climbing some of the Himalayan peaks is banned due to the belief that the mountains are the repository of the gods and all life, animal or plant, is treated with respect as a divine gift. Dzongkha is the official language. A large number of dialects are spoken, owing to the physical isolation of many villages. Sharchop Kha is spoken in eastern Bhutan. Nepali is common in the south of the country. English has been the language of education since 1964 but there is growing emphasis on learning Dzongkha to strengthen national identity.","The climate varies with altitude, with the highest temperatures and rainfall occurring in the south which bears the brunt of the monsoon between June and September.Temperatures drop dramatically with increases in altitude though days are usually very pleasant with clear skies and sunshine. Nights are cold and require heavy woollen clothing, particularly in winter. Generally, October, November and April to mid June are the best times to visit - rainfall is at a minimum and temperatures are conducive to active days of sightseeing. The foothills are also very pleasant during the winter. Lightweight cottons in the foothills, also linens and waterproof gear, light sweaters and jackets for the evenings. Upland areas: thick, warm clothing for evenings, particularly during the winter months. Bhutan is located in the eastern Himalayas, bordered to the north by China and to the south, east and west by India. The altitude varies from 180m (590ft) in the narrow lowland region to over 7,300m (23,950ft) in the Himalayan plateau in the north, and there are three distinct climatic regions. The foothills are tropical and home to deer, tigers, leopards and the rare golden langur monkey as well as much tropical vegetation, including many species of wild orchids. The Inner Himalaya region is temperate; wildlife includes bear, boar and sambar, and the area is rich in deciduous forests. The High Himalaya region is very thinly populated, but the steep mountain slopes are the home of many species of animals, including snow leopards and blue sheep."

Its two non-contiguous territories, situated on the northern coast of Borneo in South-East Asia, are home to some of the region's most pristine rain forest habitats. The country only gained independence in 1984, but has the world's oldest reigning monarchy and centuries of royal heritage. At the helm of the only remaining Malay Islamic monarchy in the world, the Sultan of Brunei comes from a family line that dates back over 600 years. The current sultan, His Majesty Sultan Haji Hassanal Bolkiah, has been on the throne for 43 years and is one of the world's richest individuals. Visitors to the ""Abode of Peace"" (the literal translation of darussalam) will find the country surprisingly laid-back and relaxing.

The country’s with China and India dates back at least a thousand years before the kingdom of Brunei was founded in the seventh century. Its kings converted to Islam around the 15th century and the Sultanate of Brunei was the region’s dominant force for almost 200 years, winning a brief war with Spain before slipping into decline. The Bruneian Empire crumbled with the loss of much of its territory to the White Rajahs – a dynastic monarchy of the English Brooke family – of Sarawak in the 19th century and Brunei became a British protectorate in 1888. Oil, discovered in the Seria area in the 1920s, changed Brunei forever. It was black gold that helped fuel Japanese interest in Borneo during World War 2 and just eight days after the attack on Pearl Harbor, Japan landed 10,000 troops on Brunei and occupied the country until June 1945 when Australian forces retook Brunei town.   Returned to British governance, a new constitution was written in 1959 introducing self-government and in the early 1960s oil – together with the failed Brunei Revolt of December 1962 – made it economically advantageous for the country to remain outside the Federation of Malaysia. Sultan Haji Hassanal Bolkiah, the country’s current absolute ruler and one of the world’s richest people, became Brunei's 29th sultan in 1967. He rules under a national philosophy known as Malay Islamic Monarchy, which promotes Islamic traditions and values and loyalty to the sultan. The activities of political parties are severely restricted. Brunei became self-governing except in foreign affairs and defence in 1971 and became fully independent from Britain in 1984. The country maintains close military, economic and cultural ties with the UK. In 2013 Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah declared his intention to impose Sharia Law on the nation’s Muslims, about two-thirds of the population, making Brunei the first and only country in the region to incorporate Sharia Law in its penal code. Did you know?  Brunei is the first country in Asia to ban shark finning.  Under Sharia Law, Christmas decorations are banned in public places but local and foreign Christians are still allowed to celebrate Christmas.  Brunei has technically been under martial law since the Brunei Revolt of 1962 and Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah also serves as the country’s Prime Minister, Finance Minister and Defence Minister. Islam is the official state religion of Brunei, and about two-thirds of Bruneians are Muslims. Buddhists (mainly Chinese) make up about 13% of Brunei's population; Christians are 10%. Visitors should dress modestly. Shoes must be removed when entering mosques and Muslim homes. Some Bruneians do not shake hands with people of the opposite sex. It is impolite to point with the index finger (the right thumb should be used instead). Food may be served without cutlery: eat using the right hand only. It is widely regarded as discourteous to refuse refreshments or to eat in public during Ramadan. Visitors should note that there are severe penalties for all drug offences, and that the legal system in Brunei is partly based on Shariah law and can, occasionally, apply to non-Muslims, including visitors. Dress is informal except for special occasions. Women should ensure that their head, knees and arms are covered. Malay is the official language. English is widely used and Chinese dialects are also spoken.","There is no good or bad season to visit Brunei.

asia,cambodia,"It might be one of Southeast Asia's smallest countries, but Cambodia can compete with the big boys when it comes to must-see sights. Once the preserve of trailblazing backpackers, this formerly war-torn nation is now firmly established on the Asia travel circuit. That luxury yachts ply their trade on Tonle Sap, Southeast Asia's largest freshwater lake, is a mark of just how far Cambodia has come. Carving the country in two is the mighty Mekong River, which remains the lifeblood of Cambodia, running as it does from the bustling capital, Phnom Penh, to Vietnam's Mekong Delta. A journey down this iconic waterway is one of the great pleasures of Southeast Asia – boats of all shapes and sizes drift, chug and spray their way along the Mekong, carrying piglets, clay pots, bananas, motorcycles, you name it. Away from the water, the ravages of war have become unlikely tourist attractions in Phnom Penh and other cities. Crowds gather at former prison camps and the notorious Killing Fields to contemplate Cambodia's darkest hour, a period of unimaginable suffering that took place under the brutal regime of Pol Pot. The crumbling remains of the Khmer Empire are the biggest draw in Cambodia, though. After building up a kingdom that stretched into neighbouring Thailand and China, the Khmers fell, leaving behind an extraordinary collection of temple complexes, most notably Angkor Wat, which owns the bragging rights to being the largest religious monument in the world. Then there are more typical Southeast Asian attractions – frenetic cities crammed with rickshaws, strange and exotic food, blissful beaches, tropical jungles teeming with wildlife, and a densely-forested hinterland full of tribal villages. There are few places that have been through as much as Cambodia, but this optimistic nation has belied its tumultuous history and emerged as one of the warmest, most welcoming destinations in Southeast Asia. 181,035 sq km (69,900 sq miles). 15,827,241 (UN estimate 2016). 86.8 per sq km. Phnom Penh. Constitutional monarchy. King Norodom Sihamoni since 2004. Prime Minister Hun Manet since 2023.","Little is known of the early history of Cambodia, although there is evidence of habitation in parts of the country dating as far back as 4000 BC. It is also known that Chinese and Indian traders exchanged goods with people living on the coasts of present-day Cambodia and Vietnam as early as the AD 1st century. According to Chinese chroniclers, a Hindu kingdom known as Funan flourished between AD 300–550, but the power of this trading empire declined for reasons unknown and their territories were claimed by the Chenla dynasty, which was divided into two parts – Land Chenla and Water Chenla – in the 8th century. During this period Cambodian power spread westwards into parts of Thailand. Cambodia’s golden era came with the arrival of the Khmer dynasty, which ruled from the 9th to the 15th centuries and made the kingdom of Kambuja (from where modern-day Cambodia gets its name) one of the most powerful in Asia. The Khmer established their most famous capital at Angkor, founded as a Hindu spiritual centre but later converted to Buddhist worship. A long period of decline followed, before the country fell under French colonial control in the 1800s. Independence was finally achieved in 1953, coinciding with the French being driven from Vietnam, after which Norodom Sihanouk was appointed king. His first reign lasted until the 1970s, when a coup d’etat by the prime minister led to Cambodia being caught up in the Vietnam War. American air raids on Cambodia played a direct role in the rise of Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge, who seized control after a brutal insurgency in 1975. During the four years of Khmer Rouge rule, tens of thousands of people were executed in a systematic campaign of genocide, targeting academics, the wealthy, the educated, city dwellers and even people who wore glasses. In 1979 the Vietnamese army captured Phnom Penh and occupied Cambodia, which was renamed the People's Republic of Kampuchea. Following UN intervention, Sihanouk returned to the throne in 1993, before abdicating in 2004 in favour of his son, Norodom Sihamoni. In the subsequent elections, the left-wing Cambodian People’s Party came to wield most of the power, led by prime minister Hun Sen. The most important ongoing issue facing Cambodia is the clearance of land mines and unexploded ordnance left behind from American bombing and the civil war, which continue to kill hundreds of people every year. Did you know? •	The Cambodian flag is the only national flag to feature a building – Angkor Wat. •	There are an estimated four million unexploded landmines still scattered around the Cambodian countryside •	Cambodia is one of the only countries in the world that has never had a McDonalds restaurant. 95% of the population are classified Buddhist (Theravada), the remainder are Muslim and Christian. Buddhism was reinstated as the national religion in 1989 after a ban on religious activity in 1975. Sensitivity to politically-related subjects in conversation is advisable. Avoid pointing your foot at a person or touching someone on the head, as it’s considered insulting. Women should keep their shoulders covered and should not wear shorts when visiting pagodas. Photography: Permitted, with certain restrictions such as the photography of military installations, airports and railway stations. It is considered polite to ask permission before photographing Cambodian people, especially monks. Khmer is the official language and spoken by 95% of the population. Chinese and Vietnamese are also spoken. French was widely spoken until the arrival of the Pol Pot regime and is still taught in schools. English is commonly spoken in Cambodia. It's estimated that over 50% of the population are conversational in English, but travellers in rural areas may find in hard to communicate in smaller villages. Learning a few basic Khmer words will get you far, and earn you respects from the locals.","Being located in the tropical zone north of the equator, Cambodia has a monsoon climate. Monsoon season runs May - November, meaning that the most pleasant season for visitors is generally the dry season, stretching from November/December - April. Immediately after the monsoon, the blanketing green of the countryside can be stunningly beautiful. In the north, winters are generally colder, while throughout most of the country temperatures remain fairly constant. The average year-round temperature in Cambodia is 27.7°C (the highest monthly average being 35°C, the lowest monthly average being 21°C). There is often seasonal flooding in Phnom Penh and the rest of Cambodia in late July and early August, and, because the majority of roads are dirt, travel may be disrupted at these times. At the peak of the wet season it can rain as often as two in every three days. While the rain may affect certain outdoor activities when travelling (many hiking, biking or boat cruise companies will cancel excursions), the temperature is pleasant and in the larger cities the rainfall acts as a burst of refreshment for the dusty roads. Do bear in mind when hiking during the region in monsoon season that leeches are plentiful; leech socks and regular leech checks en route are advisable. Lightweight clothing is worn all year. Gumboots, umbrellas and raincoats are advisable during the monsoon season - because when it rains, it pours. Rain may continue solidly for days on end. Bordered to the west by Thailand, to the north by Laos and to the east by Vietnam, Cambodia is a roughly circular country with a southern coastline giving onto the Gulf of Thailand. The landscape comprises tropical rainforest and fertile cultivated land, with lush highlands rising in both the northeast and southeast. Rivers are a central feature of its make-up, with Phnom Penh situated at the confluence of the Bassac, the Tonle Sap and the mighty Mekong. A large inland lake, also called Tonle Sap, sits close to the Angkor Temple Complex in the north. There are numerous beaches and offshore islands along the southwest coast. However, Cambodia’s main landscape is its jewel, comprising tropical rainforest and fertile cultivated land, with lush highlands rising in both the north east and south east. This rich, nutritious land also includes a wealth of nature, including rare and endangered species such as Indochinese tigers, Asian elephants and freshwater Irrawaddy dolphins. Unfortunately Cambodia suffers from high rates of illegal trading in endangered wildlife and logging, and man is fast wiping out these incredible creatures and their habitat. Around Cambodia visitors can find various eco-camps and rainforest preservation trips offering excursions, education and an alternative form of income to locals previously involved in illegal trade."
asia,china,"Colossal, dizzying and fiercely foreign, China isn’t easily compared to anywhere else on the planet. Home to approximately one fifth of the human race, it variously dazzles, befuddles, frustrates and thrills. The key visitor attractions are renowned around the globe – think the Great Wall, the Forbidden City, and the Terracotta Warriors – but it’s the sheer scale and off-kilter energy of the place that leave the most lasting impression. The economic drive of recent times means many of China’s cities are as shaped by modernity as anywhere you care to mention, but it’s also somewhere underpinned by dearly held customs and a near-unfathomable amount of diversity. China's landscapes unfurl across the map in vast swathes of territory, and its sights, sounds and infinite oddities collectively amount to one of the world’s truly great travel experiences. The food’s fantastic too, and getting to grips with the different regional cuisines can be hugely enjoyable. In other areas, tradition only counts for so much. The pace of development in its key cities – Shanghai, Beijing, Guangzhou and increasingly others – has thrown up skylines to rival almost any in the world. They’re emblematic of the ‘new’ China, a powerhouse both economically and politically; somewhere eager to make the rest of the world sit up and take notice. Even the ego-driven rulers of the past, from Qin Shi Huang through to Mao, would surely be amazed at just how influential their country has become. Shift away from the urban sprawl and out into China’s rural areas, however, and you’re confronted with a very different reality. The scenery veers from lush terraced rice paddies and the harsh peaks of the Himalayas to the gorges of the UNESCO-protected Yangtze River. In some of the rural heartlands, indeed, the tableau of life can seem little changed from 50 years ago, at least on the surface. China is full of endless quirks and contradictions, but that’s half the charm. 9,596,960 sq km (3,705,406 sq miles). 1,382,323,332 (UN estimate 2016). 142.5 per sq km. Beijing. People's Republic. China comprises 23 provinces (China considers Taiwan its 23rd province), five autonomous regions, two special administrative regions and four municipalities directly under central government. President Xi Jinping since 2013. Premier Li Qiang since 2023.","The planet’s most populous nation also stands as one of its most influential – certainly on the political stage – but the concept of collective dominance is by no means a new one to the country. In broad summary, its history has alternated between periods of disunity and periods of strong national togetherness. The first time the Chinese were truly united into a single empire was under the Qin Dynasty – builders of the initial stretches of the Great Wall – in the 3rd century BC. Power then passed into the hands of the less controlling Han Dynasty for four centuries, after which there was a long period of bitter internal conflict. The last dynasty, the Qing, survived until 1911, when Sun Yat-sen founded the Republic of China. The Japanese invaded in 1937, resulting in eight years of brutal occupation. When the invaders were eventually repelled, civil war ensued between nationalists and Mao Zedong’s communists. In 1949, the victorious communists founded the People's Republic of China, giving rise to the notorious Cultural Revolution and, among other things, the still ongoing occupation of Tibet. Even Chinese historians remain divided on the legacy of Mao, who may have helped assimilate China into a single-minded nation but was also responsible for horrific injustices on a monumental scale. He died in 1976, and only a few years later his successor, Deng Xioaping, felt bold enough to announce that Mao’s leadership had been ‘70% good, 30% bad’. By the end of the 1980s, there was widespread agitation in favour of political reform, and action against the corruption that had become widespread. The situation came to a head in May 1989, when several thousand students and workers occupied Tiananmen Square. The army was sent in and the square cleared, with great loss of life. As the 1990s progressed, those at the top of Chinese politics were gradually replaced. Jiang Zemin, who was appointed president in 1993, typified the new generation of leaders. Vice-President Hu Jintao took over the presidency from Jiang in 2003, and saw the country’s role as a forward-looking, although still tightly controlled, economic powerhouse become more defined. Hu was followed by current incumbent Xi Jinping, who came to power in 2013 promising to quash corruption. He has since had to deal with a deeply uncertain Chinese economic climate. Did you know? • There are more Christians in China (some 54 million) than there are in Italy. • It was reported in 2013 that Chinese police in Xinjiang were working with geese, the birds apparently being ‘better than dogs’ at tackling crime. • Ke-tsiap, a spicy Chinese fish sauce, gave its name to ‘ketchup’. China is officially atheist, but the stated religions and philosophies are Buddhism, Daoism and Confucianism. There are 100 million Buddhists and approximately 60 million Muslims, 5 million Protestants (including large numbers of Evangelicals) and 4 million Roman Catholics, largely independent of Vatican control. Cultural differences may create misunderstandings between local people and visitors. The Chinese do not usually volunteer information and the visitor is advised to ask questions. Hotels, train dining cars and restaurants often ask for criticisms and suggestions, which are considered seriously. Do not be offended if you are followed by a crowd; this is merely an open interest in visitors who are rare in the remoter provinces. The Chinese are generally reserved in manner, courtesy rather than familiarity being preferred. The full title of the country is 'The People's Republic of China', and this should be used in all formal communications. 'China' can be used informally, but there should never be any implication that another China exists. Although handshaking may be sufficient, a visitor will frequently be greeted by applause as a sign of welcome. The customary response is to applaud back. Anger, if felt, is expected to be concealed and arguments in public may attract hostile attention. In China, the family name is always mentioned first. It is customary to arrive a little early if invited out socially. When dining, guests should wait until their seat is allocated and not begin eating until indicated to do so. If using chopsticks, do not position them upright in your rice bowl as the gesture symbolises death. Toasting at a meal is very common, as is the custom of taking a treat when visiting someone's home, such as fruit, confectionery or a souvenir from a home country. If it is the home of friends or relatives, money may be left for the children. If visiting a school or a factory, a gift from the visitor's home country, particularly something which would be unavailable in China (a text book if visiting a school, for example), would be much appreciated. Stamps are also very popular as gifts, as stamp-collecting is a popular hobby in China. A good gift for an official guide is a Western reference book on China. Conservative casual wear is generally acceptable everywhere and revealing clothes should be avoided since they may cause offence. Visitors should avoid expressing political or religious opinions. Photography: Places of historic and scenic interest may be photographed, but permission should be sought before photographing military installations, government buildings or other possibly sensitive subjects. The official language is Mandarin Chinese. Among the enormous number of local dialects, large groups speak Cantonese, Shanghaiese (also known as Shanghainese), Fuzhou, Hokkien-Taiwanese, Xiang, Gan and Hakka dialects in the south. Inner Mongolia, Tibet and Xinjiang, which are autonomous regions, have their own languages. Translation and interpreter services are good. English is spoken by many guides and in hotels. Many taxi drivers do not speak English, even in big cities.","China’s extreme size means it has a great diversity of climates, but being located entirely in the northern hemisphere means its seasonal timings are broadly comparable to those in Europe and the US. The northeast experiences hot and dry summers and bitterly cold harsh winters, with temperatures known to reach as low as -20°C (-4°F). The north and central region has almost continual rainfall, temperate summers reaching 26°C (79°F) and cool winters when temperatures reach 0C (32°F). The southeast region has substantial rainfall, and can be humid, with semi-tropical summer. Temperatures have been known to reach over 40°C (104°F) although this is highly unusual, but during summer temperatures over 30°C (86°F) are the norm. Winters are mild, with lows of around 10°C (50°F) in January and February. Central, southern and western China are also susceptible to flooding, and the country is also periodically subject to seismic activity. Early autumn around September and October, when temperatures are pleasant and rainfall is low, is generally seen as an optimum time to visit. Spring is also popular, for similar reasons, and the many tourists visit in March or April. Be aware that if visiting during Chinese New Year a large number of businesses will be closed and public transport, in particular rail routes, can be enormously busy. If arriving in winter, heavyweight clothing and boots are recommended to cope with what can be extreme cold. Likewise, lightweight clothing should be packed for a visit at the height of summer. China is bordered to the north by Russia and Mongolia; to the east by Korea (Dem Rep), the Yellow Sea and the South China Sea; to the south by Vietnam, Laos, Myanmar, India, Bhutan and Nepal; and to the west by India, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan. China has a varied terrain ranging from high plateaux in the west to flatlands in the east; mountains take up almost one-third of the land. The most notable high mountain ranges are the Himalayas, the Altai Mountains, the Tian Shan Mountains and the Kunlun Mountains. On the border with Nepal is the 8,848m (29,198ft) Mount Qomolangma (Mount Everest). In the west is the Qinghai/Tibet Plateau, with an average elevation of 4,000m (13,200ft), known as 'the Roof of the World'. At the base of the Tian Shan Mountains is the Turpan Depression or Basin, China's lowest area, 154m (508ft) below sea level at the lowest point. China has many great river systems, notably the Yellow (Huang He) and Yangtze River (Chang Jiang, also Yangtze Kiang). Only 10% of all China is suitable for agriculture."
asia,east-timor,"Following its indepedence on 20 May 2002, East Timor became the only Asian country to be located completely in the Southern Hemisphere. The Portuguese first arrived on the island in the early 16th century and by the 1550s had occupied the eastern part. The Dutch took control of the western part, which became part of the Dutch East Indies and, after independence, Indonesia. In 1975, the new left-wing Portuguese government relinquished all of its colonies. East Timor then enjoyed just a few days of independence, before the Indonesians annexed it as their 27th province. There was little local resistance and the international community largely acquiesced. In the aftermath, the main independence movement faced a savage counter-insurgency, during which the Indonesian army killed over 100,000 East Timorese. Finally, a referendum was offered to East Timor in 1999, and 80% opted for independence. Violent reprisals by the military followed, but the country eventually became independent. Colonial architecture, Portuguese fortresses and other treasures from the 100-year Portuguese occupation can be found all over the country. However, many towns and villages were destroyed during the Indonesian occupation and the fighting in 1999, and these are only slowly being rebuilt. Many houses are still erected on stilts in the traditional way, using local materials such as grass, bamboo, tree trunks and palm leaves. Despite the tragic recent history, East Timor's immaculate reefs, little-trodden mountain paths and rich, traditional cultural that has endured in the face of war make it a true hidden gem. Hiking in the hills will bring you to otherworldly jungle caves, while exploring settlements away from the capital of Dili give a taste of village life. Well off the beaten track, East Timor is still getting back on its feet, but is a raw and compelling destination. 14,919 sq km (5,760 sq miles). 1,211,245 (UN estimate 2016). 82.5 per sq km. Dili. Republic. President José Ramos-Horta since 2022. Prime Minister Taur Matan Ruak since 2018.","In May 2002, after 450 years of foreign occupation, East Timor became the 21st century’s first new nation. Timor’s pre-occupation history is sketchy. The migration of various peoples along the South-East Asian monsoon track evidently led to the population of the island by a civilisation that had no written records but worked in iron and had a relatively sophisticated agricultural system. The Portuguese arrived in the early 16th century and by the 1550s had occupied the eastern part as the Dutch took control of the west, which became part of the Dutch East Indies. The Japanese invaded in 1942, occupying the territory until its liberation in 1945 when Portugal regained possession and remained until the Carnation Revolution of 1974 after which the new government dissolved its colonial empire. Just nine days after East Timor declared independence in November 1975 it was invaded by Indonesia and in the savage counter-insurgency that followed, more than 100,000 East Timorese lost their lives either as a direct result of fighting or through hunger and illness. In June 1999, Indonesia’s President Habibie announced a referendum offering independence or integration, but after 80% opted for independence the Indonesian army went on an orgy of destruction that displaced hundreds of thousands of people. In October 1999, a UN transitional administration was set up, pending elections, which were eventually held in April 2002 and Xanana Gusmão was installed as the new nation’s first president. More than 200,000 refugees returned to the fledgling nation. In 2008 the new president, José Ramos-Horta was injured in an assassination attempt. UN peacekeeping forces were deployed until the mission ended in December 2012. Did you know? •	Xanana Gusmão is a distinguished poet. A former freedom fighter, in prison in 1993 he was awarded the Great Cross of the Portuguese Order of Liberty. •	East Timor competed at the 2014 Winter Olympics after Alpine skier Goutt Goncalves became its first athlete to qualify for the Games. •	According to the East Timorese creation story a crocodile transformed into the island to return a favour to the boy who helped it recover from sickness. Christian majority with 86% Catholic. Islam and animist beliefs are also practised. Most social courtesies are fairly formal. Many conventions will be similar to those of Indonesia (despite their political and religious differences) and many old East Timorese conventions will doubtless come to the fore in the coming years. Tetum is the main dialect and is the official language along with Portuguese; English is often used for administrative purposes (due to the high numbers of English-speaking relief and UN workers still working in East Timor). More than 30 other languages are also used in East Timor.","Tropical monsoon climate. It is very hot and dry from July to November with the western monsoon bringing the rains from December to March. It is cooler and more humid in the mountain region. Lightweights with rainwear throughout the year. Warmer clothes are needed for cool evenings and mountain areas. East Timor makes up the eastern half of the island of Timor (the western half belongs to Indonesia) which is situated off the northern coast of Western Australia. Also included within East Timor is the Oekussi Ambeno enclave on the northwest coast of the island, as well as the islands of Ataúro (Pulo Cambing) and Jaco (Pulo Jako). East Timor is mountainous in the interior."
asia,china,"Steamy and gargantuan, Hong Kong has evolved into one of Asia’s most lovable cities. Its incredible skyline – part neon, part steel-and-glass, part towering hills – is one of the most majestic in the world, but it’s a mere backdrop to the 24-hour flurry of activity that makes Hong Kong what it is. From its boat-buzzed waterfront to its packed dim sum restaurants, its incense-smoked temples to its clattering teahouses, its street markets to its old-world hotels, Hong Kong is a destination teeming with energy. For travellers, the best advice is to go with the flow. Situated at the mouth of the Pearl River Delta on China’s southwestern coast, Hong Kong is a city that has a remarkable mix of Eastern and Western influences. The handover of this territory from Britain to China was back in 1997, but the centuries of British rule still have a lasting legacy, tangible in everything from the grand period architecture to the local passion for horse-racing. Even the name of Hong Kong’s centrepiece – the iconic Victoria Harbour – harks back to another era, and today there’s an international flavour to the destination that sets it apart from other Chinese cities. The gastronomy, nightlife and shopping are all world-class. Hong Kong Island, with its glistening skyscrapers and high-end shopping malls, is in many ways the heartbeat of the city. Get down to street level, however, and the laneways, wet markets and traditional Chinese haunts are a reminder that beyond the city lies a working class populace still making ends meet the old fashioned way – and often the hard way. It’s also worth remembering, of course, that there’s far more to Hong Kong than the city itself. Its natural attractions include hiker-friendly ranges, volcanic landscapes, pristine woodlands, sleepy islands, protected marine parks and miles of golden beaches. 1,104 sq km (426 sq miles). 7,346,248 (UN estimate 2016). 6,468.4 per sq km. Hong Kong. Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China. President of China Xi Jinping since 2013. Chief Executive John Lee since 2022.","Although Hong Kong is largely thought of in terms of its development from the colonial era onwards, humans have settled in the area since the late Stone Age. It came under the influence of China around 200 BC, with serious settlement by Han Chinese beginning in the 12th century AD. It is thought that they displaced the original inhabitants, whose descendants are now known as Tanka and traditionally live on boats. Regular contact between China and Europe began with the arrival of the Portuguese, who established a trading settlement in nearby Macau in 1557. Their influence had declined, however, by the time the British started trading in the south of the Chinese mainland around 1750. The problem was that although they wanted goods such as tea and porcelain, the Chinese were not interested in buying anything from them. The solution was to import opium from India, and when the Chinese authorities – alarmed at both the cost and the growing addiction rate – tried to block it, the British sent in gunboats. They seized Hong Kong in 1841 in the First Opium War, and a year later the Treaty of Nanking gave the British control of Hong Kong, plus the right to trade in five Chinese ports. A few years later the British took the Kowloon peninsula as a result of the Second Opium War. Then, in 1898, the New Territories were leased from China for 99 years. The British rule of Hong Kong was interrupted only by the four-year Japanese occupation during World War 2. In the years after the war, free market policies and an abundance of cheap labour helped Hong Kong’s economy grow on the back of financial services and textile manufacture. It was in December 1984 that an agreement was signed for the terms of the reversion to China, with guarantees that the territory would enjoy a high degree of autonomy, especially in the economic field. The slogan 'one country, two systems' was coined by the Chinese to describe the regime and only in foreign affairs and defence would the new Special Administrative Region be subject to the diktat of Beijing. China has largely stuck to the concept although it is often argued that the mainland has covert influence over Hong Kong politics and today, despite the lack of true democracy, Hong Kong seems to have grown again in confidence and is becoming more comfortable with its unusual political position. Did you know? • Hong Kong's Central-Mid-Levels escalator is the longest outdoor covered escalator system in the world and the total travel time is 20 minutes. • Hong Kong’s oldest university was established in 1911. • Hong Kong comprises of 261 islands; many are unpopulated and unreachable. Buddhist, Confucian and Taoist, with Christian and Muslim minorities; but there are also places of worship for most other religious groups. Handshaking is the most common form of greeting. In Hong Kong, the family name comes first; so Wong Man Ying would be addressed as Mr. Wong. Most entertaining takes place in restaurants rather than in private homes; during a meal, a toast is often made saying ""yam seng"" (meaning ""drink to success""). There may be up to 12 courses served in a meal, and although it is not considered an insult to eat sparingly, a good appetite is always appreciated and it is considered cordial to taste every dish. It is customary to invite the host to a return dinner. Informal wear is generally acceptable, although some restaurants and social functions often warrant formal attire. Smoking is widely acceptable, but is now prohibited in most public places. Cantonese and English are the official languages, with Cantonese the most widely spoken. Mandarin is growing quickly as a second language. English is widely spoken, especially in business circles.","Hong Kong has a subtropical climate with four seasons, and weather strongly influenced by two monsoons: the north-northeast monsoon from October to March and the south-southwest monsoon from April to September. Spring – from February to April – is warm and humid, with average temperatures of around 23°C (73°F). Weather is generally pleasant but the skies can be quite overcast. By summer, the humidity (around 80% is normal) and temperatures are higher. Heavy rain is a feature throughout the south-southwest monsoon, but particularly from June to August when thunderstorms are also common. Between July and September there is the risk of tropical cyclones, which come in from the South China Sea. There’s a well-organised warning system in place, whereby winds are numbered 1, 3, 8, 9 or 10 – anything rated as an 8 or above is taken very seriously and means the closure of schools and businesses. Autumn is, certainly in terms of climate, an excellent time to visit Hong Kong. Temperatures are pleasant both day and night, and humidity also falls. There’s also less rain – average rainfall in October is 101mm (4.3 inches), compared to 328mm (12.9 inches) in September. Winter is even drier but can be surprisingly cold, particularly in the evenings: mostly between 15–20°C (59-68°F), although it can be higher than this, and sometimes the temperature dips as low as 10°C (50°F). Overall, the best months to visit are the periods between the monsoons (March to April and October to November) when humidity is low, the skies are clear and the temperature is warm but not too hot. That said, there are plenty of indoor attractions in Hong Kong, so rain need not spoil a trip. Lightweight clothing and a light raincoat are recommended during the warmer months, while warmer clothes are useful in winter. It should be noted that even during the hottest weather, a jacket or pullover will be required for the sometimes fierce air conditioning indoors. The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) consists of three main territories – Hong Kong Island, Kowloon and the New Territories – plus more than 260 smaller (and mostly uninhabited) islands, located where the Pearl River meets the South China Sea. Both Kowloon and the New Territories are located on the Chinese mainland, separated from Hong Kong Island by the narrow Victoria Harbour. One of the world’s deepest natural harbours, this has been key to Hong Kong’s economic success. The SAR is hilly, with land on Hong Kong Island rising to its highest point at Victoria Peak (552m/1,811ft); in the New Territories, the mountain of Tai Mo Shan reaches 957m (3,140ft). Much of the developed land on Hong Kong Island, most notably the northern areas such as Central – site of many of the city’s best-known skyscrapers – is the product of reclamation projects. The same can be said of much of Kowloon on the other side of the harbour. The combination of hills and developed lowlands means that very little of the land within Hong Kong (only around 6% of the 1104 sq km/426 sq miles) is used for agriculture."
asia,india,"As beautiful as it is bamboozling, India is an endlessly fascinating country that challenges and surprises even the most seasoned traveller. Stretched between the golden beaches of the Indian Ocean and the snow-capped peaks of the Himalayas, India dazzles with an incredible tapestry of natural and man-made wonders. Home to some of the world’s most iconic monuments; its astounding temples, mystical monasteries, frenetic cities, pristine national parks, lavish palaces and mesmerising markets will capture and inspire your imagination. Visiting India is an exciting assault on the senses. Sights, sounds, smells and sensations are all experienced at maximum intensity. It can feel intimidating on day one, but eventually, the noise and chaos become an ordinary part of everyday life. The sensory stimulation becomes strangely addictive. Presided over by an extraordinary array of gods and deities, approximately one-sixth of the planet's population can be found here, living in anything from high-rise apartments and inner-city shantytowns, to simple huts in remote villages. India is one of the world's great melting pots, where an incredible diversity of cultures, religions and ethnicities live in unexpected harmony. An explorers paradise, you could spend a lifetime discovering the relics left behind from ancient empires and trekking its dramatic landscapes. From its tiger-filled jungles to the frozen Himalayan deserts, India’s veritable bounty of breath-taking scenery is sure to leave you awe-struck. On the first trip, almost everyone finds time for the so-called ‘Golden Triangle’; zipping from the colonial capital, Delhi, to the Taj Mahal at Agra, then on to Jaipur, the colourful capital of Rajasthan. With more time to spare, you can discover 36 UNESCO-listed sights ranging from creaking mountain railways and ancient fortresses to mangrove forests and temples overflowing with multi-armed deities. Don’t expect to absorb all India has to offer in one visit; the country is best appreciated like a buffet table, with repeat visits to sample the next tantalising platter.

The intervening 5,000 years have seen hundreds of invasions and the rise and fall of myriad empires, from the Muslim Mughals who built the Taj Mahal, to the Portuguese – the first European powers to arrive and the last to leave, in 1961 – and the French, who carved out their own Indian enclave at Puducherry (Pondicherry). The most well-known of India’s colonisers were the British, who came as traders in the 17th century, and, through the machinations of the East India Company, managed to take over the entire subcontinent. Under British rule, railways were built, great cities rose and government was centralised, but the maharajas and sultans were reduced to servants of the empire, and India became an engine to further the fortunes of a foreign power. The Indian Mutiny in 1857 marked the transition of power to the British monarchy, and also the beginning of organised resistance to British rule. While India fought alongside Britain in two world wars, intellectuals and spiritual leaders were sowing the seeds of rebellion. These ideas were crystallised by one man: Mahatma Gandhi, a former lawyer who preached a doctrine of equality to be gained through passive resistance. In 1942, Gandhi launched the ‘Quit India’ campaign, which started with gestures of civil disobedience, strikes and non-violent demonstrations and ended with Indian Independence in 1947. Tragically, communal tensions between Hindus and Muslims led to India being wrenched apart, with Muslim areas separating to become West and East Pakistan (now Bangladesh). Millions died in the process and a Hindu zealot in Delhi killed Gandhi himself in 1948. Over 70 years later, and the consequences of Partition are still felt, with India and Pakistan existing in a state of some tension. Nevertheless, in other areas, India is boldly marching forwards. India has become a major technology hub, and the Indian economy is predicted to overtake China. The Indian Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, is spearheading reforms and speeding development, despite accusations of bias towards the Hindu community. Did you know? •	India is the world’s largest democracy, with over 800 million eligible voters. •	Many of the most common terms in the English language are from India, including shampoo, jungle, mugger, dinghy, loot and bungalow. •	India was the source of all the world’s diamonds until the discovery of diamond deposits in Brazil in the 18th century. About 80% Hindu, 14% Muslim, with Sikh, Christian, Jain, Parsi and Buddhist minorities. The traditional Hindu greeting is to fold the hands, tilt the head forward and say Namaste. Indian women generally prefer not to shake hands. All visitors are asked to remove footwear when entering places of religious worship. Most Indians also remove their footwear when entering their homes; visitors should follow suit. Many Hindus are vegetarian and many, especially women, do not drink alcohol. Most Sikhs and Parsis do not smoke. Women are expected to dress modestly and men should also dress respectfully. Women should not wear short skirts and tight or revealing clothing, although there is a more casual approach to clothing in Goa. Hindi is the official language of India and, used by about 40% of the population, India’s most widely spoken. English is also enshrined in the constitution for a wide range of official purposes. In addition, 22 regional languages are recognised by the constitution. These include Bengali, Gujarati, Oriya and Punjabi, which are used in respective regions, and Tamil and Telugu, which are common in the south. Other regional languages include Kannada, Malayalam and Marathi.","The weather is mainly hot most of the year with significant variations from region to region. The coolest weather lasts from around the end ofNovember to the beginning of March, with fresh mornings and evenings, and mostly sunny days. The really hot weather, when it is dry, dusty and unpleasant, is between March and June. Monsoon rains occur in most regions in summer anywhere between June and early October. Western Himalayas: Srinagar is best from March to October; July to August can be cold and damp in winter. Shimla is higher and therefore colder in winter. Places like Gulmarg, Manali and Pahalgam are usually under several feet of snow from December to March and temperatures in Ladakh, which is a high-altitude desert, can be extremely cold. The mountain passes of Ladakh are accessible from July to October. Northern Plains: Cities like New Delhi, Varanasi, Lucknow and Patna experience an extreme range of temperatures and are typically warm from April to mid-June, falling to almost freezing at night in winter between November and February. Summers are hot with monsoons between June and September. Central India: Madhya Pradesh state escapes the very worst of the hot season, but monsoons are heavy between July and September. Temperatures fall at night in winter. Western India: November to February is most comfortable, although evenings can be fairly cold. Summers can be extremely hot with monsoon rainfall between mid June and mid September. Eastern India: Weather in states like Orissa (which is flood-prone) are defined by cooler weather from October to February, scorching heat from March to May and unavoidable drenching from the monsoons from June to October. Southwest: The most pleasant weather is from November to March. Monsoon rains fall anywhere between late April and July. Summer temperatures are not as high as Northern India although humidity is extreme. The coast benefits from some cooling breezes. Inland, Mysore and Bijapur have pleasant climates with relatively low rainfall. Southeast: Tamil Nadu experiences a northeast monsoon between October and December and temperatures and humidity are high all year. The hills can be cold in winter. Northeast: March to June and September to November are the driest and most pleasant periods. The rest of the year has extremely heavy monsoon rainfall. Lightweight, loose-fitting clothes are best along the coast and during the dry season in most of India between March and June. When the heat becomes intolerable, you may sweat a lot and want to change a few times a day. Layer up if you’re visiting the highlands even in the summer as temperatures can drop significantly at night. Also, wrap up warmly if you’re visiting the northern plains, particularly from November to February. To avoid offending local sensibilities, female travellers should wear clothes that cover the arms and legs, and pack a cotton scarf to cover your head/neck for extra modesty, especially when visiting temples and holy sites. At tourist seaside resorts such as Goa and Mumbai, female travellers can swim in bikinis but beyond tourist areas, it is best for female tourists to swim in t-shirts and shorts as they can help deflect unwanted attention. India shares borders to the northwest with Pakistan, to the north with China, Nepal and Bhutan, and to the east with Bangladesh and Myanmar. To the west lies the Arabian Sea, to the east the Bay of Bengal and to the south the Indian Ocean. The Andaman and Nicobar Islands are Indian territory but lie off the coast of Thailand in the Bay of Bengal. Sri Lanka lies off the southeast coast, and the Maldives off the southwest coast. The far north-eastern states and territories are all but separated from the rest of India by Bangladesh as it extends northwards from the Bay of Bengal towards Bhutan. India is separated from the rest of Asia by mountain ranges, forest, and desert -the Himalayan mountain range in the north, the Thar Desert in the west and the Chin Hills and Patkai ranges in the east. The Indus River runs through the northern disputed territory of Jammu & Kashmir. The most sacred of rivers, the Ganges, is in the east."
asia,indonesia,"Spread across the equator, Indonesia is a series of emerald jewels scattered across a broad expanse of tropical sea. This is one of the world's great adventures in waiting - hidden away in dense jungles on secret islands are tribes still living in isolation from the modern world and animals hardly known to science. Indonesia is the fourth most populous nation on Earth with an incredible legacy of people, culture and geography just waiting to be explored. This archipelago boasts more than 18,000 islands, from tiny islets not much bigger than a palm tree to rugged expanses of land like Borneo, shared with the Malaysian states of Sabah and Sarawak. Many visitors come specifically to seek out their own island paradise, complete with white-sand beaches, swaying palms and emerald waters. Below the waters, there are some of the world's best dive sites, swarming with huge sunfish, giant rays, sharks, porpoises, turtles and a blindingly colourful array of tropical fish. For others, the attraction is cultural. A fascinating range of civilisations has developed across these tropical islands, from animist tribes in remote jungle villages to the elaborate Hindu kingdoms of Bali and Java. In Indonesia, timeless temples jostle for space with golden-domed mosques and beach resorts crowded with sun-seekers and surfers. The surf resort of Kuta in Bali has become one of the world's favourite tropical escapes, and the beach parties rave through till dawn every day of the week. Those in search of a real escape can venture to the volcanic islands that drift eastwards towards Australia. There are towering volcanoes to be climbed, national parks to be explored and tropical rainforests to be trekked. You might even get lucky and meet a babirusa endemic to Sulawesi or the world's largest living reptile on the island of Komodo, home to the eponymous Komodo dragon. Best of all, flights and ferries link all of the major islands, so you can island-hop right across the archipelago, stopping only when you find your own perfect piece of Southeast Asia. 1,904,569 sq km (735,358 square miles). 269,544,949 (2019) 140.08 per sq km. Jakarta Republic. President Joko Widodo since 2014. President Joko Widodo since 2014.","The discovery of the remains of 'Java Man' suggests that Indonesia was inhabited by early humans as early as 1.5 million years ago, but little evidence remains of early tribal civilisations. In the 7th century, Indonesia fell under the influence of the Srivijaya kingdom, bringing Hinduism and Buddhism to the islands for the first time. Islam arrived in the 13th century, and Java and Sumatra became powerful sultanates, while other islands continued to follow Hindu, Buddhist and Animist traditions. The Portuguese were the first Europeans to settle in Indonesia in 1512, establishing trade posts for valuable spices such as nutmeg and cloves. Dutch and British traders followed in their footsteps. A century later in 1602, the Dutch established the Dutch East India Company (VOC), took over major trade routes and eventually established colonial rule over the archipelago. The start of the 20th century saw the beginnings of an Indonesian independence movement known as Sarekat Islam, which gained huge popularity, despite suppression from the Dutch colonial regime. The Japanese invasion in WWII lead to the withdrawal of the Dutch, but some four million Indonesians died as a result of the occupation. The subsequent surrender of Japan at the end of the war lead the then-president Sukarno to pronounce Indonesia's independence on 17 August 1945, but democracy was quickly replaced by an increasingly authoritarian regime with power residing ultimately with the president and a series of appointed councils. To unify this disjointed collection of kingdoms and sultanates, the Sukarno regime launched a massive propaganda campaign based on concepts of national heroes and national identity. In 1965, General Suharto seized control in a military coup and brutally suppressed opposition in a reign lasting until 1998. The independent islands of West Irian and East Timor were annexed, and farmers from Muslim majority islands were strategically settled on other islands. Eventually, opposition to Suharto's rule reached a critical level during the East Asian Financial Crisis. Suharto was forced to step down in 1998 and was replaced by B. J. Habibie. The presidents that followed included Abdurrahman Wahid, Megawati Sukarnoputri, Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono and Joko Widodo. Indonesia has faced a few major earthquakes in recent years and the country has managed to rebuild and continue to attract tourists to the archipelago. Did you know? • There are more than 150 volcanoes in Indonesia, and 127 of them are still active. • Indonesia is the most populous Muslim nation in the world. • The National Institute of Aeronautics and Space said Indonesia has 18,307 islands according to its survey, but other surveys show different figures, so no one really knows exactly how many islands they are in Indonesia. 87% Muslim, 10% Christian, 1.7% Hindu, with the remaining practise Buddhism or other faiths. Social courtesies are often fairly formal. Using a few words of the local language will be appreciated. When visiting private homes or religious buildings, take off your shoes. When drink or food is served, it should not be touched until the host invites the guest to do so. Never pass or accept anything with the left hand, as this is seen as unclean. Public displays of affection between men and women are frowned upon, and kissing in public will attract a great deal of unwanted attention. Touching a stranger of the same sex while in conversation is very common. Smiling is a cultural tradition and Indonesians smile frequently, even in an uncomfortable or difficult situation. Visitors should avoid losing their temper as saving face is very important in Indonesian culture; tourists should avoid putting others in a situation where they may feel embarrassed or ashamed. Both men and women should take care to dress in an appropriate way for their surroundings. Before taking photographs of someone, ask for permission first. Bahasa Indonesia is the official national language of Indonesia. Altogether, there are an estimated 700 indigenous languages and dialects spoken in the archipelago. Most formal education, administration, media and other forms of communication are conducted in Indonesia. English is widely spoken in tourist areas.","Indonesia is split by the equator, which results in a tropical climate across the archipelago with relatively even temperatures year-round. Inland and around the mountainous regions, temperatures average at 26°C (79°F) while the coastal regions averaging 28°C (82°F). While temperatures are relatively constant, rains do not follow the similar pattern. In general, Indonesia also has two monsoon seasons: the northeast monsoon (December to March) and the southwest monsoon (June to September). These monsoon seasons either bring an abundance of rainfall or a dry spell, depending on the geographical region you are visiting. Jakarta: the sprawling capital of Indonesia is situated on the northwest coast of Java and is sheltered from the south-west monsoon. Jakarta has a tropical monsoon climate and is characterised by one long wet season, which runs from October to May and a short dry season, which runs from June throughout September. Year-round, the temperature is warm, with an average high temperature of 31°C (88°F) and an annual average low temperature of 26°C (79°F). The prime time to experience Jakarta is from June to mid-October, during the dry season when the skies are clear. Bali: Bali allures tourists with its beautiful beaches, forested volcanic mountains and cultural sites. Located a few degrees south of the equator, this island experiences a tropical climate throughout the year. The rainy season is from November to May while the relatively dry season (some showers are still likely) is from June to October. The dry season is a good time to see Bali at its best, as there is little rain, low humidity and plenty of sunshine, with an average high of 31°C (88°F). Avid surfers can enjoy Bali's breaks all-year-round, but the best months for surfing is during the dry season. Sumatra: the island of Sumatra receives abundant rainfall throughout the year. Medan, the capital of North Sumatra province, has a tropical climate with no real dry season, although February is slightly drier than the other months. Palembang, the capital of South Sumatra province, also sees plenty of rain throughout the year, although July is slightly drier than the other months. Given the year-round tropical climate and humidity of Indonesia, lightweight and loose clothing, including cottons and silks, are recommended. Rainwear is essential, and a jacket might be needed due to the rough winds along the coast or in the mountains. Warmer clothes can be necessary for the cooler evenings and highland areas – thicker cotton and woollen garments work best. It is regarded as inappropriate for swimwear to be worn anywhere other than the beach or at sports facilities. To avoid sunburn or sunstroke, wearing a hat and sunscreen are advised. When visiting temples or other religious sites, you should wear clothing that covers your arms, shoulders and legs. Indonesia lies between the mainland of Southeast Asia and Australia in the Indian and Pacific oceans. It is the world's largest archipelago country. Indonesia is made up of five main islands - Sumatra, Java, Sulawesi, Kalimantan (part of the island of Borneo) and New Guinea - and 30 smaller archipelagos. In total, the Indonesian archipelago consists of about 18,307 islands according to the National Institute of Aeronautics and Space; 6,000 of these are inhabited and stretch over 4,828km (3,000 miles), most lying in a volcanic belt with more than 400 volcanoes, the great majority of which are extinct. The landscape varies from island to island, ranging from high mountains and plateaux to coastal lowlands and alluvial belts. The high incidence of volcanoes in Indonesia is due to its location along a stretch of the Pacific Ring of Fire. The collision of various tectonic plates means that around 90% of the world's earthquakes occur within this area, with Indonesia suffering from frequent earthquakes and volcano eruptions."
asia,japan,"From kimono-clad geishas singing traditional songs in Kyoto to manga-crazed teenagers whizzing around Akihabara 'Electric Town' in Tokyo, Japan is a fascinating land of contrasts, a heady mix of tradition and modernity that often bewilders but never bores. Nowhere in the world blends the old and new quite like Japan. The speed of new technological developments here is matched only by the longevity of its ancient customs and traditions. The country is a pioneer in the fields of design, technology and fashion. You can set your watch by the trains, eat meals that look like works of contemporary art and relieve yourself in the most technologically advanced toilets on the planet (some even talk to you). Paradoxically, Japan's embrace of the cutting edge is offset by its revered cultural traditions and celebrated historic achievements. Ancient castle ruins, atmospheric Shinto shrines and fascinating festivals are never far away, with cultural highlights including the striking Osaka Castle and Kyoto's iconic Temple of the Golden Pavilion. There's also evidence of Japan's dramatic recent history in cities like Hiroshima and Nagasaki, where nuclear bombs were dropped with devastating consequences during WWII. If you love nature, you will adore Japan. This is a country swathed in natural beauty. Ski the powdery slopes of Hokkaido, revel in the springtime beauty of the 'sakura' cherry blossoms, frolic in the sun-drenched beaches and turquoise waters of subtropical Okinawa, or climb up the iconic Mount Fuji. Wherever you go, good food is guaranteed – from fresh sushi and sashimi to charcoal-fired meats and sizzling sauces; Japan is a joy for gastronomes. It is also a land of wild eccentricities, where you can watch men strip at the festival of Hadaka Matsuri or get amorous in one of the country's many short-stay love hotels. These facets might jar somewhat with Japan's polished image, but they help make it one of the most exciting destinations on the planet. 377,915 sq km (145,913 sq miles). 126,476,461 (UN estimate 2020). 334.62 per sq km (129.2 sq miles).

Prime Minister Fumio Kishida since 2021.","Influence from the outside world, followed by long periods of isolation, has characterised Japan's history. In the feudal era (12th-19th century), a new ruling class of warriors emerged: the samurai. One of the most famous and successful samurai, Oda Nobunaga, conquered numerous warlords and had almost unified Japan when he was assassinated in 1582. Toyotomi Hideyoshi succeeded him and united the land in 1590, but war broke out following his death. Tokugawa Ieyasu defeated the rival Western Army in the Battle of Sekigahara in 1600 and was appointed shogun (military governor of Japan). The Tokugawa shogunate began the isolationist sakoku (locked country) policy that spanned the two and a half centuries of tenuous political unity known as the Edo period. In 1854, the US Navy forced the opening of Japan to the outside world. Ensuing economic and political crises led to the Boshin War and the establishment of a centralised state unified under the name of Emperor Meiji. The Meiji period (1868-1912) saw major economic and social changes, which in turn transforming Japan into an industrialised world power that embarked on a number of military conflicts to expand the nation's sphere of influence, including two Sino-Japanese Wars (1894-1895 and 1937-1945) and the Russo-Japanese War (1904-1905). On 7 December 1941, Japan attacked the US naval base in Pearl Harbor, followed by a declaration of war against the allied forces. This act brought the US into WWII and, on 8 December, the Allied forces consisting of the USA, UK, Netherlands and several other countries declared war on Japan. After the devastating atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945, Japan surrendered. The war cost Japan millions of lives and left much of the country's industry and infrastructure destroyed. Japan later achieved exceptional growth to become one of the world's most powerful economies in the 1970s. In the early years of the 1990s, the Japanese economic bubble burst, ushering in an era known as the 'lost decade' – an economic crisis from which the country has only recovered in recent years. The 2011 earthquake, which occurred off the coast of Japan and unleashed a devastating tsunami on the Tōhoku region, still looms large in the country's memory. It killed nearly 16,000 people and triggered equipment failures at the Fukushima Nuclear Power Plant, which resulted in the largest nuclear meltdown since the 1986 Chernobyl disaster. Did you know? •	Napping on the job may be frowned upon in many countries, but snoozing at work is acceptable in Japan. The practice, known as inemuri, is used to demonstrate the sleeper's dedication to their work. •	Melons are big business in Japan, with the rare black Densuke watermelon, grown only on Hokkaido, selling for around ¥28,000. •	Vending machines can be found at almost every street corner in Japan. They sell everything from batteries and rice to beer. Shintoism and Buddhism are the most common religions (most Japanese follow both religions, although religion does not play a major everyday role in most Japanese lives). Marriages are traditionally conducted at Shinto shrines and funerals at Buddhist temples, as Shintoism sees death as impure. Christians aren't common - only about one percent of Japan's population consider themselves Christians. Japanese manners and customs are vastly different from those of Western people. A strict code of behaviour and politeness is recognised and followed by almost everyone. However, Japanese people do not expect visitors to be familiar with all their customs but do expect them to behave formally and politely. A straightforward refusal traditionally does not form part of Japanese etiquette, and a vague 'yes' does not always mean 'yes'. (The visitor may be comforted to know that confusion caused by non-committal replies occurs among Japanese too.) When entering a Japanese home, shoes must be removed. Bowing is the customary greeting, but handshaking is becoming more common for business meetings with Westerners. The honorific suffix 'san' should be used when addressing all men and women; for instance, Mr Yamada would be addressed as Yamada-san. Table manners are very important, although the Japanese host will be very tolerant towards a visitor. However, it is best if visitors familiarise themselves with basic table etiquette and use chopsticks. Exchange of gifts is also a common business practice and may take the form of souvenir items such as company pens, ties or high-quality spirits. Japanese is the official language. Some English is spoken in Tokyo and other large cities but is less usual in rural areas. There are many regional dialects, and there are distinct differences in the intonation and pronunciation between eastern and western Japan.","The climate in Japan is mostly temperate with four distinct seasons, except for the Hokkaido area and the Okinawa region. Tokyo, on the main Honshu island, has a humid subtropical climate characterised by warm and wet summers and mild winters. January is usually the coldest month with temperatures averaging 5°C (41°F) while August is the hottest month with an average high reaching 31°C (88°F). The summer heat, along with high humidity levels, can make travelling uncomfortable. Precipitation in Tokyo amounts to 1,530mm (60in) a year, meaning rainfall is abundant (especially from June to October), so umbrellas or raincoats are essential. For more information, see the weather in Tokyo and the best time to go guide. Hokkaido, the northernmost island, is also Japan's coldest region. Winters are long and harsh with plenty of snowfall, making it a prime destination for snow sports. Ski resorts here often open from early December to April. Sapporo, Hokkaido's capital and host of the 1972 Winter Olympic Games, has an average temperature of -3°C (27°F) in February, so wrap up warm if you visit during this period. On the other hand, the Okinawa prefecture is about 1,600km (1,000mi) south of Tokyo. The archipelago here enjoys a sub-tropical climate with very mild but rainy winters. Summers here are long, usually lasting from May to September, with average highs swing between 27-32°C (81-90°F). Typhoons can hit Japan, most likely during August and September but can occur from June to October. They bring strong winds and torrential rains. Powerful typhoons may damage buildings and cause transport disruptions. There is a danger of landslides in rural areas too. In general, the best time to visit Japan is from March to May, and from late September to November. April is recommended for visitors who are after the spectacular views of cherry blossoms. Equally, October is the month for those in search of colourful autumnal leaves. Most visitors avoid the summer months as they are rainy and muggy. In Japan, lightweight cottons and linens are required throughout summer in most areas. To avoid sunstroke and sunburn, it is advisable to wear a hat. Summer is also the wettest period in many parts of Japan, so take an umbrella or a raincoat. Depending on the region, light to medium weight clothing is best during spring and autumn, while medium to heavyweight clothing is recommended for winter months. Much warmer clothes will be needed in the mountains all year round. Thermal innerwear is recommended if trekking, climbing or skiing. The archipelago of Japan is separated from the Asian mainland by the Sea of Japan and split into four main islands: Honshu, Hokkaido, Kyushu and Shikoku. About 70% of the country is covered by hills and mountains, a number of which are active or dormant volcanoes, including Mount Fuji, Japan's highest peak, reaching 3,776m (12,388ft). Japan sits on major seismic fault lines and is susceptible to frequent earthquakes. A series of mountain ranges run from northern Hokkaido to southern Kyushu. The Japanese Alps (the most prominent range) run in a north-south direction through central Honshu. Lowlands and plains are small and scattered, mostly lying along the coast, and composed of alluvial lowlands and diluvial uplands. The coastline is long and has very varied features. For example, the deeply indented bays with good natural harbours tend to be adjacent to mountainous terrain. Many of Japan's major cities are located on the coastline and have an extremely high population density. Okinawa, a chain of islands in the East China Sea, is Japan's southernmost prefecture. Geographically, it is closer to Taiwan than to the four main Japanese islands. Its distinct subtropical climate and pristine beaches are the main drawcards."
asia,kazakhstan,"Unexplored by many, Kazakhstan is a curious yet little-known land of vast plains, mountainous horizons and beautiful culture. Bordering Russia in Central Asia, it's truly massive in size – this is, after all, ranked as the world's ninth biggest country. It's also the most economically successful of those countries surrounding it, known fondly as the 'stans'. This is largely thanks to oil reserves, as well as other natural resources. The upshot? You can expect more modern, higher-quality hotels, restaurants and travel options compared to some of the country's poorer neighbours. South Kazakhstan is a focus of Central Asian history, featuring many famous monuments. It is a scenically diverse region where the snow-capped peaks, lakes and glaciers of the Tian Shan range give way to steppe and desert. The desert is home to the Singing Barkhan - a sand dune 3.2km (2 miles) long, which, as it crumbles, produces a peculiar singing sound. Almaty was until very recently the former capital of Kazakhstan and it enjoys a beautiful setting between mountains and plains. Still the country's biggest city, it is a hub of modern architecture, cool fountains, parks and spectacular mountain views. You can also expect irreverent nightspots, trendy cafes, and palatial malls there. The present capital of Nur-Sultan (Astana) is following in its predecessor's footsteps as a modern metropolis, with its space-age buildings clinging to the northern steppe. The truth is, though, that travellers are more likely to be attracted to Kazakhstan's natural wonders. It's a beautiful country in its own haunting way, where intrepid travellers will enjoy hiking through the lofty mountains and down in the valleys of the Tian Shan. Its sparseness can seem mind-boggling, but you'll find plenty of wildlife if you look for it, especially in the lake-strewn steppe. It's also worth seeking out the underground mosques and villages that are scattered about the land. All in all, Kazakhstan is a special, unique country well worth discovering despite it being low on the radar of most tourists. 2,724,900 sq km (1,052,089 sq miles). 17,855,384 (UN estimate 2016). 6.7 per sq km.

Soon after, the Saks, Savromat, Kangues and Usuns occupied the area and later, the Huns. By the fourth century AD, most of the Saks and Usuns had moved west and individual states appeared, such as Westturkic Khanate, which was established by Turkish tribes trading on the Silk Road. During the eighth and ninth centuries the Kimak tribes arrived of which the largest and strongest were the Kipchaks, ancestors of the present-day Kazakhs. In the 10th century, Islam was declared the state religion before the Mongols invaded in the 13th century and Genghis Khan destroyed most of the towns. However, by the 15th century, the Kazakh Khanate state was thriving as the tribes reformed into three groups – Junior, Middle and Senior Zhuzes – known as Kazakhs. In 1734 the Junior Zhuze became Russian citizens, followed by the Middle in 1742 and the Senior Zhuze in 1849. The Kazakhs had allied themselves with Russia in the mid-18th century to ward off the Mongols, but by 1860 the Russians had suppressed the last of the Kazakh rebellions and thousands of Russian and Ukrainian peasants settled in Kazakhstan. A final anti-Tsarist rebellion in 1916 was brutally supressed before the Bolshevik revolution and yet more fierce fighting in the civil war that followed. In 1920, Kazakhstan was recognised as an autonomous republic and although its mining and chemical industries, as well as agriculture, developed greatly, more than two million Kazakhs died of hunger during the 1930s before the country again experienced large-scale immigration. It was the site of most of the main testing and launch facilities for the Soviet nuclear, missile and space programmes and the first manned spaceflight by Yuri Gagarin was launched from Baikonur in central Kazakhstan. In 1986, the Brezhnevian regime was deposed in favour of a new administration under Gennadi Kolbin, a protégé of the reformist Soviet leader, Mikhail Gorbachev. Three years later Nursultan Nazarbayev, replaced him and guided Kazakhstan to independence. As the only candidate at the presidential election in December 1991, he won 98 per cent of the vote and in June 1997 realised his pet project, the inauguration of a new capital city at Astana. Astana was renamed Nur-Sultan on 23 March 2019 after former first president Nursultan Nazarbayev, who passed away on 20 March 2019. Kazakhstan’s main assets are its huge and largely unexploited oil and gas fields. Did you know? • Kazakhstan is home to 131 ethnicities. • World IBF, WBO and IBO heavyweight boxing champion Vladimir Klitschko was born in Kazakhstan. • The unfinished Mausoleum of Khoja Ahmed Yasawi in Turkestan dates from the late 14th century is widely considered to represent the Khazakh national identity. Mainly Sunni Muslim. There are Russian Orthodox and Jewish minorities. There are 10 independent denominations of Christianity. The Kazakhs do not express their religious feelings fervently - Kazakhstan is an outlying district of the Muslim world and a meeting point of Russian, Chinese and Central Asian civilisations. Islam plays a minor role in policy and there are no significant Islamic political organisations in the country. Kazakhs are very hospitable. When greeting a guest, the host gives him/her both hands as if showing that he/she is unarmed. When addressing a guest or elder, a Kazakh may address him/her with a shortened form of the guest's or elder's name and the suffix 'ke'. For example, Abkhan may be called Abeke, Nursultan can be called Nureke. This should be regarded as indicating a high level of respect for the visitor. At a Kazakh home, the most honoured guest, usually the oldest, is traditionally offered a boiled sheep's head on a beautiful dish as a further sign of respect. National customs forbid young people whose parents are still alive from cutting the sheep's head. They must pass the dish to the other guests for cutting. Inside mosques, women observe their own ritual in a separate room, and must cover their heads and their arms. Formal dress is often required when visiting the theatre, or attending a dinner party. Shorts should not be worn except on the sports ground. The official language is Kazakh, a Turkic language closely related to Uzbek, Kyrgyz, Turkmen and Turkish. The government has begun to replace the Russian Cyrillic alphabet with the Turkish version of the Roman alphabet. Meanwhile, the Cyrillic alphabet is in general use and most people in the cities can speak Russian, whereas country people tend to only speak Kazakh.

Although Kazakhstan has some of the highest peaks in the CIS, the climate is fairly dry. The hottest month is July (August in mountain regions). Five times the size of France and half the size of the USA, Kazakhstan is the second largest state in the Commonwealth of Independent States, and is bordered by the Russian Federation to the north and west, the Caspian Sea, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan to the southwest, Kyrgyzstan to the south and China to the southeast. 90% of the country is made up of steppe, the sand massives of the Kara Kum and the vast desert of Kizilkum, while in the southeast of the country the mountains of the Tian Shan and the Altai form a great natural frontier with tens of thousands of lakes and rivers. Lake Balkhash is the country's largest expanses of water, since the Aral Sea dried up."
asia,kyrgyzstan,"Often referred to as the “Switzerland of Central Asia”, Kyrgyzstan certainly lives up to this moniker with its soaring mountain ranges, glistening glaciers and vertiginous pine forests. If it feels like you’re on top of the world, that’s because you’re not far off. Despite its ubiquitous natural beauty and considerable size, few people can point to this landlocked nation on the map let alone pronounce its name (it’s Kur-gi-stan, by the way). Even fewer actually visit. This is due largely to Kyrgyzstan’s geographical isolation, but also because it has been out in the cold politically – since gaining independence from the USSR, the country has remained well under the influence of neighbouring Russia. Visitor numbers are increasing, but a short tourist season, an underdeveloped infrastructure and poor air links remain obstacles for all but the intrepid traveller. However, those who do make it here are guaranteed an experience they won’t have to share with the crowds. Although mountains dominate, Kyrgyzstan’s landscapes are surprisingly varied: snow-capped peaks eventually give way to open plains and shimmering lakes. It really does look Switzerland in places, but elsewhere the countryside can conjure up images of Scotland, Kashmir and even the Middle East. The mountain vistas alone are reason enough to visit and no trip to Kyrgyzstan would be complete without trekking up at least one of its impressive summits. For less active visitors there are a handful of beaches to speak of and, in the small window that passes as summer, holidaymakers can be found bathing on the shores of lakes such as Issyk Kul. Located in the Tian Shan mountains, this is a summer resort for the brave – the water here is bracing to say the least. It’s not all about the landscapes, though. In fact a big draw for tourists is the prospect of staying with the country’s semi-nomadic shepherds, who live in yurts and eke out traditional lives in this harsh, unforgiving and unremittingly beautiful country. 199,951 sq km (77,201 sq miles). 6,033,769 (UN estimate 2016. 28.3 per sq km.

Chairman of the Cabinet of Ministers Akylbek Japarov since 2021.","The region now known as Kyrgyzstan has seen many invasions and colonisations over the centuries. First settled during the pre-historic period, it became home to Scythian clans during the 1st millennium BC before coming under the control of various Turkic alliances from the 6th century onwards, a period in which the region prospered from its prime location on the Silk Road between China and Europe. Islam arrived with Arab invaders in the 8th century but the Arabs did not stay long and the region came under the control of the Karakhanid dynasty based in Bokhara shortly afterwards. Kyrgyz tribes started to arrive from southern Siberia sometime around the 10th century, although they soon fell victim to Genghis Khan’s Mongol horde that was plundering and devastating vast tracts of Central Asia at this time. The Kyrgyz later became subjects of the Chinese and the Uzbek Kokand Khanate until Russian Tsarists colonised the region in the early 19th century. Kirgizia, as it was formerly known, became part of the Soviet Union in 1922 and remained an autonomous republic within the USSR until independence in 1991 when it seceded along with many other former Soviet republics. The first president of the newly formed Kyrgyz Republic, Askar Akayev, managed to remain in power for 16 years before being ousted in a landslide victory in 2005 following widespread demonstrations against high levels of poverty and alleged political corruption. The victor of this so-called ‘Tulip Revolution’ was Kurmanbek Bakiyev, who served as president until 2010 when widespread violent protests forced him to leave the country. These same protests also triggered ethnic violence between Kyrgyz and Uzbeks in the south of the country resulting in hundreds of deaths and thousands fleeing as refugees. The new president, Almazbek Atambayev came to power in December 2011. The major religion is Islam with 80% of Kyrgyzstan's citizens being Sunni Muslim. Christian and Russian Orthodox minorities make up a further 17%, with 3% following other religions.. Hospitality is an important component of Kyrgyz life and guests are highly honoured, especially in rural households. If invited to a Kyrgyz home or yurt a small gift is appreciated. Shoes should always be removed at the threshold. Kyrgyzstan is a fairly conservative country and handshaking should take place between men but not between men and women. At a meal, bread should be treated respectfully and never put on the floor or casually discarded. Food is eaten with the right hand only. Bride-kidnapping, although now officially illegal, is still practised in parts of the country. The official language is Kyrgyz, a Turkic language closely related to Uzbek, Kazakh, Turkmen and Turkish. Any attempt by a foreigner to speak Kyrgyz will be greatly appreciated. In deference to the Russian population of Kyrgyzstan, Russian is also protected under law. Kyrgyz is written using an adapted Cyrillic script similar to Russian. Meanwhile, most people can speak Russian, and do so, especially in the north. English is widely spoken by those involved in tourism. Uzbek, Kazakh, Tajik, Korean and various other regional languages and dialects are also spoken.","The best time to visit Kyrgyzstan is between May and October as getting around outside this period can be difficult. Trekking is best between June and September, although July and August are the busiest times for foreign visitors. The south of the country, and even Bishkek, can be uncomfortably warm at this time of year, so if these are the prime destinations to be visited, spring or autumn may be a better choice. The landlocked nation of Kyrgyzstan is bordered to the north by Kazakhstan, to the west by Uzbekistan, and to the south and east by Tajikistan and China. The majestic Tien Shan (Heavenly Mountains) range occupies the greater part of the area and 90% of the country stands above 1,500m, with 71% above 2,000m. The highest peak in Kyrgyzstan is Pik Pobedy at 7,439m (24,406ft) and the lowest point is Kara-Daryya at 132m (433ft). Kyrgyzstan is also home to several sizeable lakes, by far the largest being Lake Issyk-Kul in the northwest of the country, which stands at 1,606m (5,269 ft) above sea level and is the second largest alpine lake in the world. The climate is extreme and varied, ranging from dry continental to polar in the high Tien Shan, from subtropical in the southwest to temperate in the northern foothill zone."
asia,laos,"Laos – officially known as the Lao People's Democratic Republic – is one of the great travel frontiers; landlocked and mountainous, swamped by jungles and promising Indian Jones adventures in remote tribal villages and ancient Buddhist caves. With Thailand on one side and Vietnam on the other, you might expect Laos to be commercial and crowded, but this is Asia’s backwater, where life moves as slowly as the churning waters of the Mekong River, which forms the border with three countries – Myanmar, Thailand and Cambodia – as it snakes south towards the Gulf of Thailand. A long-running civil war – during which the USA dropped millions of bombs in Laos – kept the country off the mainstream tourist circuit for many years. Unexploded ordnance and poor infrastructure continue to pose a challenge to tourism, but each year brings a new crop of upmarket accommodation to supplement the existing backpacker hostels – Laos is finally finding its feet. Eco-tourism looks set to be its trump card, taking visitors to remote tribal villages and pristine national parks teeming with weird and wonderful wildlife. Despite this rugged outlook, the capital city, Vientiane, feels remarkably cosmopolitan, helped by a café culture left behind from when this was part of French Indochina. Dotted around its pleasantly faded, palm-shaded streets are ancient ruins, gleaming stupas and graceful colonial buildings. The laidback atmosphere and the relative lack of modern development make Laos perhaps the most authentic and unspoiled of the Southeast Asia nations, though it competes for this title with neighbouring Myanmar. Laos is also one of the few communist countries left in the world – which should be obvious from the bureaucratic red tape and the omnipresent red stars on uniforms and state buildings. Until 1988, tourists were banned from Laos, but now it is possible to travel all over the country. Nevertheless, there are few crowded tourist hotspots, with the possible exception of monastery-studded Luang Prabang and the overblown backpacker resort of Vang Vieng. Wherever you go in Laos, you’ll encounter the delectable Lao cuisine: a little bit French, a little bit Southeast Asian, and perfect washed down with a bottle of Beer Lao. 236,800 sq km (91,400 sq miles). 6,918,367 (UN estimate 2016). 29.2 per sq km. Vientiane. People's Republic. President Thongloun Sisoulith since 2021. Prime Minister Phankham Viphavanh since 2021.","In ancient history, Laos was a collection of scattered tribal communities and little written record of this early period survives. Most of what we know follows the Chinese invasion of Laos during the 4th and 5th centuries. After the Chinese, the next foreign power to gain influence over Laos was the Hindu Khmer Empire, which spread across the country before founding its capital at Angkor in neighbouring Cambodia. During this period, the previously dominant Chinese were displaced by a massive influx of ethnic Tai peoples from Thailand and Hinduism slowly gave way to Buddhism. The Khmer Empire eventually collapsed into warring city-states, paving the way for the independent kingdom of Lan Xang, founded in 1353 at Luang Prabang. Populated by a mixture of ethnic Laos, Thais and various hill tribes, the Lan Xang Empire lasted for three centuries, fighting off successive invasion attempts from Vietnam, Siam (Thailand) and Burma. Internal power struggles in the 18th century were exploited by its neighbours, notably Thailand, which finally conquered Vientiane in 1779, absorbing southern Laos into the Kingdom of Siam. The Siamese were the dominant power until the arrival of the French in the 1870s. Joining Cambodia and Vietnam, Laos became part of French Indo-China, and colonial administration saw plantations established across the country. The Japanese occupation in WWII weakened French control and Laos finally achieved independence in 1953. The restoration of the monarchy under King Sisavang Vong was initially welcomed, but resistance grew, spearheaded by the fighters of the Pathet Lao and the Laotian Patriotic Front (LPF) the Pathet Lao, who were allied to communist forces in Vietnam. The Lao Civil War mirrored the Vietnam War, and vast quantities of ordnance were secretly dropped on Laos by the US military to weaken the communist uprising. When Vietnam adopted communism in 1975, Laos followed suit, abolishing the monarchy and redrawing the economy along austere communist lines. Laos became dependent on military and economic assistance from Vietnam, and other neighbours closed relations with the Lao regime, leading to more than a decade of isolation. Tensions finally began to ease in the late 1980s, and Laos slowly opened up to the outside world. Today, the country is mostly at peace and the Lao People's Revolutionary Party (LPRP) remains firmly in control, though some rebel groups are still active. Despite limited political reforms in the 1990s, Laos still languishes behind its neighbours on most economic indexes. Did you know? •	Although Laos was never officially at war with America, more than 2 billion tons of bombs were dropped on the country by the US. •	Vientiane’s famous Patuxai archway was funded by an American donation that was actually intended for the construction of a new airport! •	The biggest Lao export is coffee, a legacy of the coffee plantations founded in the French colonial period. The majority of the Lao people are Buddhists. The Laos-Lum (Valley Laos) people follow the Hinayana(Theravada) form of Buddhism. The religions of the Laos-Theung (Laos of the mountain tops) range from traditional Confucianism to animism and Christianity. Religious beliefs should be respected. Lao people should not be touched on the head and women should not touch monks. Handshaking is not that usual; Lao people greet each other with their palms together and a slight bowing of the head. Take care when discussing politics and related subjects in conversation so as not to cause offence. Laos is a Buddhist country and guests should dress accordingly. Shorts or revealing clothes are never acceptable. For women, sarongs work well in the heat as do long-sleeved light cotton shirts. Shoes must be removed when entering a religious building or somebody's home. It is a legal requirement to carry an ID document or a passport, and fines for not having one for presentation on demand can be high. The Lao government prohibits sexual relationships, including sexual contact between foreign citizens and Lao nationals, except when the two parties have been married in accordance with Lao family law. Penalties for failing to register a relationship range from fines to imprisonment. The official language is Lao; however, many tribal languages are also spoken. French, Vietnamese and some English are spoken.","Throughout the country, the climate is hot and tropical, with the rainy season between May and October when temperatures are at their highest, up to 35°C. The weather is very similar to that of northern Vietnam. The dry season runs from November to April, which is the best time to visit as the temperature is at its most comfortable. However, the mountainous areas can be very cold at this time, down to around 5°C. Across Asia the annual monsoon is becoming ever more difficult to predict, possibly as a result of global warming. This plays havoc with farming and occasionally travel plans too. As a guide, the average rainfall in the capital Vientiane is about 1,700 mm, although in the north of Laos and the highlands it is far wetter, with more than 3,000 mm each year. Lightweights and rainwear, with warmer layers from October to March and for upland areas. If you come during the monsoon summer months, bring lightweight waterproofs, an umbrella and some leech oil for trekking. Bring a swimming costume for hotel swimming pools too. Laos is a landlocked country encircled to the north by China, to the south by Cambodia, Vietnam to the east, to the west by Thailand along with a 235km-long (146 miles) Mekong River border with Burma. Apart from the Mekong River plains, along the border to Thailand, the country is mountainous, particularly in the north, and in places is densely forested. The western border is demarcated by the Mekong River – which along with the tributaries covers about 20% of the land mass. Laos is mainly mountainous, with steep terrain, tapered river valleys. The mountains stretch across the north, except for around Vientiane and the Plain of Jars in Xiangkhoang Province. These mountains are sparsely populated by tribal minorities who traditionally have not acknowledged the border with Vietnam any more than lowland Lao have been constrained by the 1,754km (1,090 miles) Mekong River border with Thailand. Thus, ethnic minority populations are found on both the Laotian and Vietnamese sides of the frontier. Because of their relative isolation, contact between these groups and lowland Lao has been mostly confined to trading. Migration and conflict have affected the ethnic structure of the country and to the geographic distribution of its ethnic groups."
asia,china,"Slipping more and more comfortably into its reputation as the “Vegas of the East,” Macau plays host to a dizzying array of large-scale casino resorts. Famously the world’s biggest gambling hub, it is one of two Special Administrative Regions of the People’s Republic of China – the other being neighbouring Hong Kong. Macau showcases many of the same brands as its Nevada counterpart: MGM, Wynn and Sands are all in town, while its flagship Venetian Resort – complete with canals and mock Italianate plazas – is currently the largest casino on the planet. But there’s more to the destination than poker tables and betting halls. When Macau's historic centre was added to the UNESCO World Cultural Heritage list in 2005, it underlined the strategic and cultural importance which the territory has had over the centuries. Portuguese colonists arrived in the mid-16th century and developed Macau into a major regional trading post. They held onto it long after it had been eclipsed by Hong Kong as a magnet for merchants; longer than they held onto Goa or Brazil. Overlooking the South China Sea, Macau consists of a peninsula and two small islands, Taipa and Coloane. The three areas have been artificially joined by land reclamation, much of which is covered in casinos. Mercifully, it is possible to escape the neon lights and gambling dens in Macau’s urban parks and historic centre, where colonial Portuguese architecture sits among the bustle of a modern Asian city. The street stalls and restaurants of the old town are also a fine introduction to local food, which encompasses traditional Chinese and Portuguese dishes alongside Goan, Brazilian and African influences. 28.2 sq km (10.9 sq miles). 601,969 (CIA estimate July 2017). 21,346.4 per sq km. Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China. President of China Xi Jinping since 2013. Chief Executive Ho Iat Seng since 2019.","Macau came under the sway of China in the 3rd century BCE, but it was the arrival of the Portuguese – who had colonial bases in Goa and Melaka – in 1557 that established Macau as an international trading port. The union of the Portuguese and Spanish crowns between 1580 and 1640 marked a golden age for Macau. The territory soon became the major entrepôt between the Far East and Europe, and several other colonial powers, most notably the Dutch, made repeated but unsuccessful attempts to conquer it. Portugal split from the Spanish Habsburgs in 1640, but by then its power in Southeast Asia was in decline. British prominence in the region began when they opened a trading post nearby on the Chinese mainland in 1750, which is known today as Hong Kong. Using gunboat diplomacy, Britain forced the Chinese to accept imported opium from India, a trade that helped Hong Kong compete with Macau. Conflicting viewpoints and growing resentment between Britain and China sparked the first Opium War (1839-1842), which was essentially a dispute over trade. During this tumultuous time the Macau remained under Portuguese control until the Carnation Revolution of 1974, which sounded the death knell for the Portuguese Empire and saw Macau gain a kind of quasi independence. In 1985, the Portuguese began negotiations with Beijing on the transfer of sovereignty of the territory and the final settlement provided for a handover in 1999, after which Macau would become a Special Administrative Region within China. Today, Macau is the world’s most profitable gambling destination and keeps Beijing at arm's length after China agreed not to interfere in local affairs for 50 years. Did you know? •	Macau is the world’s most densely populated region with 21,346 people per sq km in 2017. •	Portugal’s three biggest football teams – S.L Benfica, Sporting CP and FC Porto – all have branches in Macau. •	Macau was the first and last Asian country to be a European colony. The main religions are Buddhism, Roman Catholicism, Protestantism and Taoism. The majority are Buddhists. Entertaining generally takes place in restaurants and public places. It is rare to be invited to a private home, unless the person is wealthy. Spirits are standard gifts in return for hospitality. Apart from the most formal occasions in restaurants and nightclubs, casual wear is acceptable. The official languages are Chinese (Cantonese) and Portuguese. English is widely spoken by those engaged in trade, tourism and commerce. Hokkien and Mandarin are also spoken.","Macau has a subtropical climate, with temperatures regulated by its coastal location. Seasonal changes are heavily influenced by monsoons: it is warm and humid when southeast and southwest winds come in from the Pacific, drier and colder when the north winds come from Siberia and northern China. Winter for Macau runs from November to February, which is when the northeast monsoon prevails, and is generally cold and dry. Spring comes in March and April, in the transition between the two monsoons, and brings with it wet and foggy weather. From May to September, during the southern monsoon, it is hot and rainy (with most rain occurring in the afternoon). Autumn, from the late September through October, is sunny and comfortably warm. The average temperature for the year is around 23C (73F). In winter it can get as low as 10C (50F), while in summer it can reach the low 30s (86F). Winds can reach gale force and typhoons, coming in from the Pacific Ocean, are not unknown. They tend to hit between May and October, bringing with them rain and lower temperatures. Overall the best time to visit is autumn (October to December), when days are sunny and warm and the humidity low. Wear light cotton clothes in summer, take a sweater for cooler nights from September to November and a jacket for winter. Be prepared for rain at any time, but particularly from May to September. Downtown Macau is situated on a tiny peninsula at the mouth of the Pearl River, on the southern coast of China’s Guangdong Province (although it is politically distinct from the province). It was once an island, but has been linked to the mainland through land reclamation which has also significantly increased the size of the settlement. As a result the terrain is largely flat, although with hilly portions which indicate the location of the original land. Three bridges link the peninsula to its nearest island, Taipa, which in turn is joined to the island of Côloane by the 2.2km (1.4-mile) Cotai Strip causeway (an area of reclaimed land which effectively makes the two islands into one). At the extreme northern end of the peninsula, on a narrow isthmus, is the imposing Portas do Cerco gateway (Border Gate), which leads to the Zhuhai and Zhongshan areas of the People's Republic of China. There is also a border crossing from the Cotai strip, designed to make access to the casinos even easier. Some 60km (37 miles) to the east-northeast, across the mouth of the river, is Hong Kong. There is talk of a project to build a series of bridges and tunnels which will link Macau, Zhuhai and Hong Kong; the longest section of bridge could be a huge 22.8 km (14.2 miles) long. The start of the ""fourth link"" project had been scheduled to start in 2009 but had been delayed due to concerns about its environmental impact."
asia,malaysia,"With reefs and rainforests, mountains and minarets, skyscrapers and sampans, Malaysia certainly lives up to its slogan: “truly Asia.” One of the world’s great cultural melting pots, Malaysia is a nation where Chinese joss houses, Hindu temples and gold-domed mosques jostle for space with towering skyscrapers. The British once presided over this fascinating sampling platter of Asian culture, leaving behind a legacy of hill stations, polo fields and high tea. In fact, Malaysia offers two countries for the price of one; Peninsular Malaysia, bordering Thailand at the southern end of the Malay Peninsula; and East Malaysia, the northern half of the island of Borneo, nuzzling up against Indonesia and Brunei. This opens up some spectacular opportunities for nation-hopping across Southeast Asia. Malaysia’s supercharged capital, Kuala Lumpur, resembles a crystal garden that has grown miraculously in the jungle. Indeed, pockets of virgin rainforest still survive amongst the towering skyscrapers, multi-storey shopping malls and monorail tracks. If you do nothing else, devote a day to sampling KL’s street food; from Chinese noodles and Indian dosas (rice pancakes) to aromatic and spicy Malay curries and seafood. Away from the cities, untamed nature awaits, in the form of jungles dripping with rare and exotic species and coral reefs thronged by turtles, sharks and tropical fish. Malaysia’s national parks and wildlife reserves are well-organised and well looked after, and you might be lucky enough to meet Malaysia’s most charismatic resident, the orang-utan (literally, “forest man”). Then there are the islands; tropical resorts such as Langkawi, Tioman and the Perhentian Islands have become almost legendary for fans of swaying palms, sparkling sand and scuba diving on pristine reefs. Malaysia’s dive sites – particularly those reached on live-aboard safaris – rank amongst the best in the world. Peninsular Malaysia is where people go for bustling cities and colonial history, but the states of Sabah and Sarawak on Borneo are the gateway to another world.

Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim since November 2022.","The tribal history of Malaysia dates back 40,000 years, but Hindu and Buddhist kingdoms spread out across the peninsula from the 3rd century BC onwards. Islam arrived with Indian and Arab traders in the 13th century and Malacca was established as the seat of the first Malay sultanate. Over the following centuries, Islamic dynasties spread their faith across the peninsula and surrounding islands. The Dutch and Portuguese were the first colonial powers to establish trading posts in Malaysia, but the British took an increasingly dominant role from the 18th century onwards. In 1857, the port cities of Georgetown (Penang) and Malacca were joined by a new city, Kuala Lumpur, which sprouted out of the jungle-cloaked interior. Founded by Chinese tin miners, KL grew to become first a provincial capital, and later the capital of the nation. Established in 1895, the Federated Malay States remained under British control until the Japanese invasion in WWII and occupied the region for three years. Having been re-conquered by the Allies, popular support for independence grew and the 11 states were reinvented under autonomous rulers as a British protectorate and rebranded as the Federation of Malaya. From 1948 to 1960, the country faced a violent communist uprising, known as the Emergency, which drove a wedge between the Malay and Chinese populations. After a series of complicated negotiations, the federation merged with Singapore and the former British colonies of Sarawak and Sabah (formerly North Borneo), to form a new federal Malaysia, which came into existence on 16 September 1963. But with power concentrated amongst Muslim Malays, Chinese-dominated Singapore seceded to become an independent state in 1965, leaving Malaysia in its present form. Since independence, Malaysia has grown into one of the powerhouse economies of Southeast Asia, despite a number of national crises, most significantly the Asian financial crisis of 1997. The political situation is still volatile, with internal power struggles between the main political parties, and unresolved tensions between Malay, Indian and Chinese citizens, but its economy is ranked third largest in the region. Did you know? •	Malaysia has never recognised Israel and will have no diplomatic ties with it until a peace agreement with the State of Palestine is signed. •	Traditional Malay music is based around percussion instruments the most important of which is the gendang drum. •	The state of Sabah is home to the rafflesia plant, which produces the largest flower in the world. Malaysia's official religion is Islam and 60% of the population are Muslim, but the country also has Hindu and Buddhist populations. Chinese Malaysians also follow Taoist and Confucianist traditions and tribal people in Borneo and other remote areas following traditional animist beliefs. Social conventions in Malaysia are dictated by religion and culture, with different norms amongst Muslim Malays, Indian Hindus and followers of Chinese religions. The catch-all greeting in Bahasa Melayu is selamat, but Malays are more likely to use the Arabic phrase assalamualaikum, meaning 'peace be with you'. The standard title for Malay men is Encik (pronounced Enchik), which can be used with or without the person’s name; single Malay women should be called Cik (pronounced Che) and married women Puan. Touching the hand to the chest is a sign of respect and a relaxed wrist and gentle touch should be adopted when shaking hands. Chinese and Indians usually use Western forms of address. Hospitality is always warm, lavish and informal. When eating food by hand, only the right hand should be used. Visitors should respect religious beliefs and follow the Malaysian example, particular when it comes to appropriate attire. Footwear should be taken off at the door when entering a house or temple. Outside the workplace, dress should be informal, but not overly casual. Bahasa Melayu is the national and official language, but English is widely spoken. Other languages such as Chinese (Cantonese and Hokkien), Iban and Tamil are spoken by minorities.","The best time for beach holidays or scuba-diving will depend on which part of Malaysia you intend to visit. The country is affected by the south-west monsoon from May to September and the north-east monsoon from November to March, and different parts of the country have their dry and wet seasons at different times of year. On the west coast, the wettest months are May to October, while on the east coast, the wettest months are September to December. Kuala Lumpur is wettest from March to April and September to November, while Malaysian Borneo sees its heaviest rainfall between November and February. The best time to visit for dry weather is June and July on the east coast, January and February on the west coast, April in Sabah and June to July in Sarawak. Lightweight, loose-fitting clothes are sensible at any time of year. To avoid offending local sensibilities, female travellers should wear clothes that cover the legs and upper arms. Note that shorts are rarely worn by adults, except at the beach. Full-length trousers will create a better impression. Because of the rainfall patterns and the vagaries of Malaysia weather, always carry an umbrella. Malaysia is situated in central South-East Asia, bordering Thailand in the north, with Singapore to the south and Indonesia to the south and west. It is composed of Peninsular Malaysia and the states of Sabah and Sarawak on the north coast of the island of Borneo, 650 to 950km (404 to 600 miles) across the South China Sea. Peninsular Malaysia is an area of forested mountain ranges running north-south, on either side of which are low-lying coastal plains. The coastline extends some 1,900km (1,200 miles). The west coast consists of mangrove swamps and mudflats which separate into bays and inlets. In the west, the plains have been cleared and cultivated, while the unsheltered east coast consists of tranquil beaches backed by dense jungle. The major islands are Langkawi (a group of 99 islands), Penang and Pangkor off the west coast; and Tioman, Redang, Kapas, Perhentian and Rawa off the east coast. In Malaysian Borneo, Sarawak has alluvial and, in places, swampy coastal plains with rivers penetrating the jungle-covered hills and mountains of the interior. Sabah has a narrow coastal plain which gives way to mountains and jungle. Mt Kinabalu, at 4,094m (13,432ft), is the highest peak in Malaysia."
asia,maldives,"The Maldives is a by-word for luxury, romance and tropical bliss. A beautiful string of low-lying coral islands in the Indian Ocean, they're also a paradise for diving enthusiasts and sun-seekers alike. The country's 26 natural atolls and over 1,000 islands boast uniformly perfect coasts dropped like pearls in the warm waters of turquoise blue lagoons. With bright white powdery sand fringing most of the islands, it’s not surprising that over a million visitors come here each year. The tourism industry began to blossom in the 1970s and now is the Maldives’ most lucrative industry. The luxury market is its unique selling point, and it is home to some of the world’s best hotels. Pretty much every resort has its own private island, complete with personal butlers and in-room massages. Such opulence has made it a firm favourite with honeymooners, who revel in the possibility of escaping to a romantic haven. The islands also offer slightly less pricey options, and some resorts are aimed at families and divers. The Maldives are extremely low lying (80% of the territory is less than 1m/3.3ft above sea level). As such, the islands have worked hard to become one of the most environmentally friendly countries on earth and continue to so. Luxury and tourism have often been essential in providing economic benefits to local inhabitants who struggle to utilise local resources. Recently, it has become more feasible on the Maldives for independent travellers and backpackers to avoid the luxury hotels and stay among the local people. The growing number of private guesthouses may well give the Maldives a new lease of life away from big-money tourism.

After a 1,400-year-long Buddhist period and with the arrival of Arab traders, the islands eventually converted to Islam in the 12th century and became a centre of the coir industry. The tough fibre from the husk of dried coconuts was turned into rope and used on shipping as far afield as China and Yemen. The islands remained Islamic, resisting all attempts to convert it to Christianity, even during the period of Portuguese control, which lasted on and off into the 17th century. In 1887 the Sultan of the Maldives signed over his territory to British protection, giving up the islands’ control over policy but maintaining self-government. British rule continued until independence in 1965, despite earlier abortive attempts by various factions to claim a republic and overthrow the sultan. A popular referendum was held in 1968 to decide if the newly independent nation should continue its constitutional monarchy – the sultan, Muhammad Fareed Didi, had declared himself king three years earlier – or become a presidential republic. More than 81% of the population voted in favour of establishing a republic, ending the 853-year monarchy. The country’s modern history is largely shaped by Maumoon Gayoom, who was president between 1978 and 2008. Following the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake, the Maldives were devastated by a tsunami. Several islands were destroyed, and the total damage was estimated at US$400 million. In 2008 Gayoom, who ruled the country virtually unchallenged, finally made concessions to allow for free and democratic elections. After a run-off, long-time political dissident and opposition leader Mohamed Nasheed was declared president. Despite having been imprisoned on multiple occasions by Gayoom's police, Nasheed signalled that his government would not prosecute any member of the previous administration. The new government focussed on much-needed reforms such as improving education, health care, social security and environmental protection. After the arrest of a senior criminal court judge, controversy erupted and Nasheed resigned and was replaced by his vice president in 2012. Current resident Ibrahim Mohamed Solih assumed office in 2018. Although the plans announced in 2009 to become the world’s first carbon-neutral country were soon ditched, the Maldives today has one of the most ambitious plans to phase out plastics. Did you know? •	President Nasheed held the world’s first underwater cabinet meeting in October 2009. •	The Maldives’ highest point is found on Villingili Island, rising to just 2.4m (7.9ft) above sea level. •	In September 2013 a coconut was detained by police for acting suspiciously outside a polling station. The indigenous population is entirely Sunni Muslim, and the group practice of other religions is illegal. The majority of the indigenous population does not mix with the tourist visitors, with the exception of those involved with tourism in the resorts and Malé. Dress is informal, but locals who are Muslim will be offended by nudity or scanty clothing in public places, and the government rigidly enforces these standards. Bikinis and other scanty beachwear are not acceptable in Malé or on any other inhabited island; they should be restricted to resort islands only. When entering a mosque, the legs and the body, but not the neck and the face, should be covered. Handshaking is the most common form of greeting. The indigenous population not involved in the tourist trade lives in isolated island communities, maintaining almost total privacy. A large number of locals smoke, but smoking and eating during Ramadan are discouraged. The national language is Dhivehi. English is widely spoken by locals. French, German, Russian, Italian and Chinese are widely used at resorts.","The Maldives has a year-round hot tropical climate. The Maldives has two distinct and dominating seasons: a dry season (November to April), punctuated with northeast winter monsoons, and a wet season (May to October) associated with southwest monsoons and strong winds. Generally, the southwest brings more wind and rain in June and July. Due to this, this time is popular with surfers, as areas see bigger waves and larger swells. January to April is typically known as peak season, as they have little rain and low humidity. Due to this, hotel and resorts prices will increase during this period. The temperature rarely falls below 25°C (77°F). Lightweight cottons and linens throughout the year. Light waterproofs are advised during the rainy season. More modest clothing when visiting local villages and cities outside of the resorts. The Republic of Maldives consists of about 1,190 low-lying coral islands, of which only 200 are inhabited. Most of the inhabited islands are covered by lush tropical vegetation and palm trees, while the numerous uninhabited islands, some of which are mere sand spits or coral tips, are covered in shrubs. Each island is surrounded by a reef enclosing a shallow lagoon. Hundreds of these islands, together with other coral growth, form an atoll, surrounding a lagoon. All the islands are low-lying, none more than 2.4m (7.9ft) above sea level."
asia,mongolia,"Mongolia is far-flung and hardly well-trodden, but do not let that put you off. There is so much to see and do in this sizeable Central Asian country, from the stunning scenery and wildlife of mountains and deserts to the emerging luxury hotels and restaurants in the capital, Ulaanbaatar. In the ancient land of Mongolia, history buffs and culture vultures will find plenty to keep them entertained. Outside of the main cities, many Mongolians continue to hold on to the traditional life of herdsmen. Residing in portable felt and canvas tents (known as 'ger'), the modern-day Mongolian nomads move from one place to another in search of shelter, water supply and food for themselves and their animals. Mongolia's vast areas of wilderness, from the sprawling Gobi Desert to the snow-peaked mountains located in the Bayan-Ölgii Province, offer plenty of scope for adventurous outdoor enthusiasts. Fishing, jeep tours, horse and camel riding, mountain biking and birdwatching are but a few of the activities on offer. Intrepid visitors can also explore numerous temple ruins like Mañjuśrī Monastery on the slopes of Bogd Khan Mountain or Ongi Monastery in the Dundgovi Province. While infrastructure remains relatively underdeveloped in vast swathes of rural Mongolia, elsewhere the country is racing headlong into the 21st century. The capital Ulaanbaatar is transforming at a pace that any returning visitors will find dizzying. In a relatively short space of time, the city has turned into an ultra-modern metropolis with international restaurants, five-star hotels, shopping malls and glass tower blocks – a sure sign of Mongolia's status as an up-and-coming Asian travel hotspot. While there is plenty of nightlife and excitement in Ulaanbaatar, do not visit Mongolia without exploring the wild, largely unspoilt landscapes and traditional lifestyle of its inhabitants. Leaving the capital does not mean being stranded from civilisation. Internet is now available even in small villages and it is not uncommon to see nomads toting mobile phones. It is perhaps this contrast that makes Mongolia such a fascinating destination to visit today.

It was these raiding tribes that ultimately caused the Chinese to build the Great Wall of China. Under the leadership of Genghis Khan, the Mongol Empire (1206-1368) stretched from Korea to Hungary. Even today, Mongolians view this period as their golden age and Khan still enjoys God-like reverence. After the fall of the Qing Dynasty in 1911, Mongolia declared independence from China and formed close allies with the Soviet. Following the revolutions of 1989, the Mongolian Revolution of 1990 overthrew the communist party in charge without bloodshed. Although a multi-party system was established quickly, the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party remained in power until 1996. Mongolia's foreign relations are dominated by its giant neighbours, China and Russia, and based on various bilateral friendship treaties. However, in recent times, the Mongolians have quietly begun developing closer ties with the West. In 2003, for example, a small but symbolically significant contingent of Mongolian troops was dispatched to Iraq to support the US-led military operation. Did you know? • Mongolia's first pop-rock band, Soyol Erdene, formed in 1971. They are still active today. • The country's main festival, Naadam, in which participants compete in horse racing, archery and traditional Mongolian wrestling, known as bökh, has existed for centuries and is held throughout the country in July. • On 21 November 2005, George W. Bush became the first sitting US President to visit Mongolia. • Mongolia does not have a navy. 55% Buddhists, 39% atheists, the rest Christians and Muslims. Be respectful and do not confuse Mongolians with Chinese. If you are invited to dine with Mongolians, always receive tea and food with your right hand. Thoughtful gifts are welcome and visitors should give them with both hands. Photography: Always ask for permission before taking pictures of people. Khalkha Mongolian is the official language. There are also two dialects - Oirat and Buryat.","Mongolia has a continental climate with long, cold winters and short, warm summers. Temperatures vary wildly from season to season. Much of the country is a large plateau with an average elevation of 915m to 1,524m (3,000ft to 5,000ft) and subject to strong winds, especially in spring. The best time to visit Mongolia is from May to September when the days are warm – but do bring waterproofs as this period is also rainy. Ulaanbaatar is the capital and sits at 1,300m (4,250ft) above sea level. Due to its elevation and latitude, spring arrives late in April in Ulaanbaatar. The average high in April is 8°C (46°F) while the average low is -5°C (23°F). Summer is warm but rainy – June is the wettest month with 50mm (11 inches) of rain in one month. Temperatures drop quickly after September and by November, the average high is below freezing at -5°C (23°F). Winter is cold – Ulaanbaatar is the coldest capital city in the world on average. In January, the average high is -16°C (3°F) while the average low is -29°C (-20°F). The Gobi Desert is located in the south of Mongolia; hence it is slightly warmer than Ulaanbaatar. In Sainshand, in the eastern Gobi desert steppe, July is the warmest month with an average high of 29°C (84°F) and an average low of 17°C (63°F). Temperatures drop quickly after September too and by January, the average high is -12°C (10°C) and the average low is -23°C (-9°F). Bring layers, mediumweight clothing and waterproofs if you are visiting Mongolia from May to September. Bring heavyweight clothing (a parka, woollen beanie, gloves, boots) from October to April. Mongolia has a 3,485km (2,165-mile) border with the Russian Federation in the north and a 4,677km (2,906-mile) border with China in the south. Much of the country is a large plateau with an average elevation of 915m to 1,524m (3,000ft to 5,000ft). Then there are three mountain ranges - Altai Mountains dominate the northern and western areas, the Khangai Mountains is almost at the centre but more towards to the west, while Khentii Mountains in north-eastern Mongolia. The Gobi Desert, a rocky desert with a thin layer of shifting sand, covers the southern part of the country. The Khülten Peak, within the Altai Mountains range, is the highest peak at 4,374m (14,350ft). Hoh Nuur, a lake, is the lowest point that lies at 560m (1,837ft) in the east. There are several hundred lakes in the country as well as numerous rivers, of which the Orkhon River is the longest at 1,124km (698 miles)."
asia,myanmar,"Once a pariah state, Myanmar – previously known as Burma – is fast becoming the must-see destination in Southeast Asia, helped by an incredible array of tourist sights: golden stupas as tall as skyscrapers, ancient ruins, fascinating hill tribes, unexplored jungles, peaceful beach resorts, legions of monks, and mesmerising cities made legendary by writers like Rudyard Kipling and George Orwell. Ruled by a secretive military junta, Burma was closed for decades to the outside world. When it finally opened, travellers were initially restricted to a handful of locations: the magnificent temples of Bagan, the floating villages of Inle Lake, the monasteries of Mandalay, and Yangon, the former capital, with its colonial relics and towering pagodas. That was then. With the end of the travel boycott called by Aung San Suu Kyi, travellers are queuing up to visit Myanmar, captivated by the idea of seeing what Asia was like before the tourists arrived. Nevertheless, the government still controls where visitors can go and what they can see, and many people have qualms that their tourist dollars help fund the military, which stands accused of widespread abuses. Those who do visit discover a fascinating, and famously friendly culture on the threshold between tradition and modernity. Monasteries are the foundation of Burmese society and even in rapidly expanding Yangon life is focused on Buddhist rituals. The sense of devotion is tangible at the awe-inspiring Shwedagon Paya, which towers over Yangon like an enormous golden pillar. As Myanmar has opened up to the outside world, travellers have pushed beyond the Bagan-Inle-Mandalay triangle, visiting peaceful outposts like Kalaw, Hsipaw and Kengtung and trekking to remote tribal villages. Smaller numbers make it to the jungles of northern Myanmar or the rain-drenched ports of the far south and west. Myanmar even has its own patch of the Himalaya, accessed from remote Putao in the far north. Through it all, the mighty Irrawaddy River snakes like a twisting Burmese python, offering some of the most atmospheric river journeys in Southeast Asia. Nevertheless, Myanmar remains a controversial destination, promising significant challenges as well as rewarding experiences. 676,578 sq km (261,227 sq miles). 54,363,426 (UN estimate 2016). 83.2 per sq km.

The first unified state was founded at Pagan (now Bagan) in 1057, but the capital was ravaged by Kublai Khan in 1287. A succession of dynasties rose and fell along the Irrawaddy, before the British arrived, conquering the south of the country in 1852. After the fall of Mandalay in 1886, Burma became a province of British India, marking the start of a troubled colonial period. During WWII, the Japanese expelled the British from Burma, but opposition to Japanese occupation grew rapidly. Burmese General Aung San led an uprising against occupying forces, and Burma gained its independence in 1948. He was assassinated the same year, allegedly by his closest political rival. A military coup in 1962 ushered in the regime of General Ne Win, who imposed a totalitarian socialist dictatorship. In 1988, after years of bizarre policies and isolationism, a popular uprising by students and Buddhist monks was brutally suppressed, with thousands killed. Ne Win relinquished his official title, but continued to wield considerable influence in the new State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC). Diverse resistance movements found a spokesperson in Western-educated Aung Sang Suu Kyi, daughter of Aung San, who won a convincing victory in the first Burmese election, held in 1990, as head of the National League for Democracy (NLD). The result was ignored by the junta and Suu Kyi began a 15-year period of house arrest and persecution. The country’s troubles continued with the 2007 Saffron Revolution, where protests over fuel prices were supressed, with the death and imprisonment of thousands. After general elections, which were boycotted by the NLD, Thein Sein was elected President of Myanmar, but real power continued to reside with the military. Aung San Suu Kyi was released in 2010 and many sanctions against Myanmar were dropped in 2012, but a new wave of violence began with riots against the minority Muslim Rohingya people. New elections in November 2015 were won decisively by the NLD, with a transition to civilian government having taken place in January 2016. Did you know? •	Myanmar is one of only three countries to not adopt the metric system; the local measure of weight is the peiktha. •	Burmese people wear yellow paste made from tree bark on their faces as a sunscreen. •	While Myanmar is nominally Buddhist, locals also venerate animist spirits known as nats, who are believed to reside on Mount Popa. 89% Theravada Buddhist. The remainder are Hindu, Muslim, Christian and animist. Many Buddhists also hold some animist beliefs, including worship of nats (spirits) which are rationalised as being disciples of the Buddha. Handshaking is the normal form of greeting, but only with the right hand; the left hand is associated with using the toilet. Full names are used, preceded by U (pronounced oo) in the case of an older or well-respected man's name, Aung for younger men and Ko for adult males; a woman's name is preceded by Daw. There are no inherited family names. Courtesy and respect for tradition and religion is expected; for instance, shoes and socks must be removed before entering any religious building and it is customary to remove shoes before entering a traditional home (in modern residences this may not be observed any longer except in bedrooms). When sitting, avoid pointing the soles of the feet towards people or in the direction of Buddha images as this is considered offensive. Dress should be modest, so both men and women should avoid shorts cut above the knee (a few local men wear shorts, but really long trousers are more appropriate if you can tolerate them in the heat). Mini-skirts and tight or revealing clothing should not be worn. Penalties for drug-trafficking range from five years' imprisonment to a death sentence. Homosexuality is illegal, although Yangon does have a very discreet gay scene. The official language is Myanmar (Burmese) but there are also many other dialects and languages. English is spoken in business circles and it's possible to get by in English in major tourist areas, although a few words of Burmese are appreciated.","Myanmar has a monsoon climate with three main seasons. The hottest period is between February and May, when there is little or no rain and temperatures can rise above 40°C (104°F). The rainy season is generally from May to October, giving way to dry, cooler weather from October to February. The coast and the mountains see significantly more rainfall than the arid central plains, which include Mandalay and Bagan, and roads can become impassable during the rainy season in those areas. Overall, the best months to visit are from November to February. The only notable downside (other than the fact that places are busy with other tourists) is that river travel can be slow as water levels are low, meaning that boats have to travel more slowly; this is particularly notable on long journeys as ferries cannot travel overnight for fear of being grounded on sandbanks. Lightweight cottons and linens are recommended throughout most of the year. A light raincoat or umbrella is needed during the rainy season. Warmer clothes are advised for cooler season and some evenings, particularly in hilly areas, on ferries or for trips on Inle Lake. It's also a good idea to wrap up when travelling on buses, as the drivers tend to overuse the air-conditioning. Myanmar is roughly diamond-shaped – with a long southeastern ‘tail’ – and extends 925km (575 miles) from east to west and 2,100km (1,300 miles) from north to south. It is bounded by China, Laos and Thailand in the east, by Bangladesh and India in the north and by the Indian Ocean in the west and south. The Irrawaddy River runs through the centre of the country and fans out to form a delta on the south coast; Yangon stands beside one of its many mouths. North of the delta lies the Irrawaddy basin and the arid plains of central Myanmar, which are protected by a horseshoe of mountains rising to over 3,000m (10,000ft). To the west are the Arakan mountains and the Chin, Naga and Patkai Hills; the Kachin Hills are to the north; to the east lies the Shan Plateau, which extends to the Tenasserim coastal ranges. The Kachin range includes Southeast Asia’s highest mountain, Hkakabo Razi which reaches 5,881m (19,295ft). Intensive irrigated farming is practised throughout central Myanmar, and fruit, vegetables and citrus crops thrive on the Shan Plateau. Much of the land and mountains are covered by subtropical forest, although this coverage has been reduced by extensive logging particularly for teak."
asia,nepal,"Officially the highest country on Earth, lofty Nepal is commonly referred to as the “roof of the world.” That seems like a fitting moniker for this Himalayan nation, where soaring, snow-capped mountains disappear into the clouds like stairways to heaven. Mount Everest is the star attraction. Tourists come in their droves to climb, hike and admire the world’s tallest peak, which flirts with the stratosphere at 8,848m (29,029ft). But this charming country is much more than just mountains. The birthplace of Gautama Buddha, Nepal is an important pilgrimage site for millions of Buddhists, who come from far and wide to visit the UNESCO World Heritage Site of Lumbini, a temple complex where Buddha once lived. Holy places abound in Nepal, but not just of the Buddhist variety; Hinduism has a strong foothold in the country and there are many Hindu temples scattered across the country (though some have been severely damaged by the 2015 earthquakes). Also hit hard was the Nepali capital, Kathmandu, which is encircled by soaring mountain ranges. A beautiful, bustling city it stands at a cultural crossroads between India and China, whose influences can be seen in the architecture and tasted in the cuisine. Meanwhile, a Western vibe prevails in the lively Thamel district, which is lined with bars. Kathmandu is a good starting point for travellers venturing into the jungle at Chitwan National Park, which is home to Bengali tigers, crocodiles and one-horned rhinos, plus myriad bird species. Phewa Lake is another draw for tourists, as are the hiking trails in the Himalayas. Wherever you go though, wide smiles will be there to greet you; Nepalese people are amongst the friendliest in the world and it’s not uncommon to be invited into a stranger’s home for tea. Sitting atop the world, Nepal is just one step away from heaven – and for those who have discovered the country’s many charms, it feels like it too.  147,181 sq km (56,827 sq miles). 28,850,717 (UN estimate 2016). 214.4 per sq km.

An ambitious man, Shah attempted to expand into nearby Tibet, but his plan was thwarted by the Chinese during what became known as the Sino-Nepalese War (1788-1792). Barely 20 years later and the country was fighting unsuccessfully again, this time with Britain over disputed borders with India. In losing the Anglo-Nepalese War (1814-1816), Nepal ceded a lot of territory and political power to Britain, whose presence in Nepal destabilised the country and helped Jang Bahadur Rana to power in 1848. Under Rana’s rule, the monarchy was stripped of power and an undemocratic dynasty of hereditary prime ministers was established. This suited the British – who were well-respected by Rana – and in 1923 they granted Nepal independence. However, rather than being liberated, Nepal slid into obscurity under Rana, leading to growing dissatisfaction within the country and, ultimately, a coup, in which his regime was overthrown in 1951. With Rana gone, the monarchy was restored and the Nepalese Congress Party – comprised mainly of anti-Rana rebels – was installed in government. With Nepal back on the map, visitors returned, including New Zealander, Edmund Hillary, who became the first person to scale Mount Everest in 1953. But by 1960 Nepal was once again thrown into turmoil; realising that a monarchy and democratic government were incompatible, King Mahendra dissolved parliament. Bowing to growing disquiet, his successor, King Birendra, held a referendum in 1979 to decide the future of Nepali politics. However, its people voted, by a small minority, to maintain the status quo, which failed to placate critics. In 1990, once again, unrest forced the king’s hand and he agreed that a new democratic constitution was necessary. The following year Nepal held its first democratic elections in 50 years. Yet the nineties were characterised by economic failure, which laid the foundations for the Nepalese Civil War. The armed conflict – between the Maoist Communist Party of Nepal and the beleaguered government – lasted a decade and reached its nadir in 2001, when a state of emergency was declared. In the same year, Crown Prince Dipendra, heir to the throne, went on a drunken rampage, murdering the King and several family members before committing suicide. Eventually, in 2006, a peace deal was signed, which brought the Maoists into mainstream politics and curtailed the power of the monarchy further (a year later, the monarchy was abolished). Nepal has been largely peaceful since and Nepal’s most recent elections in 2013 – which are disputed by Maoists – show signs of forward momentum. But, politically speaking, there’s still a mountain to climb. Mainly Hindu (85%) and Buddhist (8%), with a small Muslim minority (4%). Be careful to respect local customs: Never step over the feet of a person - always walk round; never offer food and drink that you have tasted or bitten; never offer or accept anything with the left hand - use the right or both hands; it is rude to point at a person or statue with a finger (or even with a foot). Often when people shake their head, it means 'yes'. Footwear should be removed when entering houses, especially kitchens and shrines. Do not stand in front of a person who is eating. Shaking hands is not a common form of greeting; instead, press the palms together in a prayer-like gesture (Namaste). Casual-wear is suitable except for the most formal meetings or social occasions. However, bikinis, shorts, bare shoulders and backs may not be appreciated. Men only remove their shirts when bathing. Overt public displays of affection, especially near religious places, are inappropriate. Seek permission before entering a temple, and do not take leather articles inside them. Photography: Always ask permission first. In general, photography is allowed outside temples and at festivals, but not inside temples or at religious ceremonies; however, there is no hard and fast rule, and the only way to be sure of not giving offence is to ask first and accept the answer. The official language is Nepali (spoken by 49%). There are many other languages, including Maithili and Bhojpuri. English is spoken in business circles and by people involved in the travel trade.","Monsoon season begins around the end of June and lasts until the end of September. About 80% of Nepal's annual rainfall is during that period, so the remainder of the year is pretty dry. Spring and autumn are the most pleasant seasons; winter temperatures drop to freezing, with a high level of snowfall in the mountains, while high summer can be blisteringly hot. Summer and late spring temperatures range from 28ºC (83ºF) in the hill regions to more than 40ºC (104ºF) in the Terai. In winter, average maximum and minimum temperatures in the Terai range from a brisk 7ºC (45ºF) to a mild 23ºC (74ºF). The central valleys experience a minimum temperature often falling bellow freezing point and a chilly 12ºC (54ºF) maximum. Much colder temperatures prevail at higher elevations. The Kathmandu Valley, at an altitude of 1,310m (4,297ft), has a mild climate, ranging from 19-27ºC (67-81ºF) in summer, and 2-20ºC (36-68ºF) in winter. Lightweight and tropical clothes with umbrella are advised for June to August. Between October and March, lightweight clothes are worn in Kathmandu, with a coat for evenings and warm clothing for the mountains. When trekking in the mountains, high quality trekking gear that can handle minus temperatures is recommended all year round. Nepal is a landlocked kingdom sharing borders with Tibet to the north and India to the west, south and east. The country can be divided into six zones: the Terai, the Chure hills, the Mahabharat range, the Pahar zone, the Himalaya and the Trans-Himalaya. The greater part of the country lies on the southern slope of the Himalayas, extending down from the highest peaks through hill country to the upper edge of the Ganges Plain. The hilly central area is crossed by the Lower Himalayas, where there are eight of the highest peaks in the world, leading up to Mount Everest. Wildlife in Nepal includes tigers, leopards, gaur, elephants, buffalo, deer and rhinos."
asia,north-korea,"Perhaps the world's most insular, provocative and challenging country, North Korea is hardly the archetype of an alluring holiday destination. Yet more and more foreigners are signing up for tours of the socialist state. The reason? There's simply nowhere else on Earth quite like it. North Korea – or the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) – is a totalitarian socialist state with an elaborate cult of personality built around the Kim dynasty. Its isolation and ideology means that independent travel is impossible. Instead, there are a number foreign agencies that offer tours of the country with government-approved guides, regaling sightseers with propaganda-skewed tales of local history, while steering them clear of interaction with the general public. All approved tours begin and end in the country's capital, Pyongyang. A city of more than 2.5 million inhabitants, the long working hours and strict curfew can often make it appear empty – yet there's an abundance of socialist sites for the foreign visitor to enjoy. Highlights include the flame-topped Juche Tower (a monument to the state's socialist ideology), the Mansudae Grand Monument (bronze statues of former leaders Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il) and USS Pueblo (an American ship captured in 1968 and now on permanent display). Beyond the capital most excursions include visits to Myohyang-san (a mountain with a palace carved into it), Panmunjom (the tense military border between North and South Korea) and Mangyongdae (a North Korean village said to be the birthplace of Kim Il-sung). And then there's the food. Sharing a culinary heritage with South Korea, the North boasts a similar smorgasbord of delicacies, offering visitors an authentic taste of this most inauthentic of countries. North Korea might not be the most easygoing destination, but if you can accept its tyrannical leadership and take everything you are told with a pinch of salt, there are plenty of incredible experiences to be had in the world's most mysterious country. 120,538 sq km (45,540 sq miles). 25,281,327 (UN estimate 2016). 207.3 per sq km.

Following the ancient inhabitants of the island – it is believed to have been inhabited for half a million years, with the earliest pottery dating to around 8000 BCE – came the foundation of the Old Joseon Kingdom in 2333 BCE. Centuries of independent states, occupied regions and royal dynasties followed, culminating in a brief Korean Empire between 1897 and 1910. Then the Japanese came and annexed Korea, distantly ruling the country for more than three decades. When Japan was defeated in 1945, a power struggle took place between the south of the peninsula, protected by US forces, and the north, backed by both the Soviet Union and by China. Two states were subsequently declared in 1948, with a division at the 38th parallel. Unresolved tensions of the division led to Kim-il Sung's northern forces invading the south in 1950, sparking the costly Korean War. Despite the subsequent bloodshed, the conflict finally ended in 1953 with the peninsula still divided at those pre-war borders. Although a ceasefire was declared, there was never a peace treaty, so North and South Korea remains at war today. Since then, the North's Democratic People's Republic of Korea has remained a Soviet style republic under the rule of the Kim dynasty – first Kim il-Sung, then Kim Jong-il and now Kim Jong-un. In recent decades, while the South Korean economy has prospered, North Korea has remained heavily dependent on foreign aid. Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, that aid fell dramatically and the economic situation has been precarious ever since. With its people suffering food shortages and even famines, the country regularly accepts foreign aid. Today, North Korea remains one of the world's poorest and least-developed countries. While there are regular talks held with foreign powers, the country's increasing isolationism and nuclear brinksmanship (resulting in sanctions) mean the future of North Korea is uncertain.

asia,pakistan,"From the ancient Mughal city of Lahore to the snow-capped peaks of the Karakoram Mountains, Pakistan is a diverse nation defined not just by its natural beauty and architectural splendours, but by its friendly inhabitants, varied wildlife and rich culinary traditions. Shame then, that political instability and sectarian violence has made large parts of the country a no-go for tourists, and prevented Pakistan from realising its potential as a top travel destination. However, those daring enough to take a punt on Pakistan will be richly rewarded for their endeavours – particularly those with a penchant for the great outdoors. The North-West Frontier Province and Gilgit-Baltistan region are home to some of the world’s most famous mountain ranges, including Himalaya, Karakoram and Hindu Kush. That explorers will have these sights more or less to themselves is another boon; gone are the well-marked routes and tea houses of India and Nepal, here lies real adventure. From jaw-dropping mountain scenery to bustling conurbations, Pakistan’s vibrant cities each have their own distinct flavour. The super-sleek capital, Islamabad, is a modern metropolis bristling with contemporary architecture, world-class cultural attractions and some of the country’s finest restaurants. Lahore is the very antithesis to Islamabad. Pakistan’s cultural capital, this ancient city abounds with UNESCO listed attractions, stunning shrines and ornate Mughal architecture. Its old town is a maze of bustling bazaars, which harbour mosques, museums and manicured gardens. Karachi, the former capital and the economic powerhouse of the country, is a mega-city in every sense of the word, cramming 15 million or so into its boundaries. Meanwhile, Peshawar, in the North-West Frontier Province, remains a frontier town, sometimes dangerous and always intriguing. Those seeking sun and seclusion, should explore Pakistan’s glorious coastline, which is home to some of the most pristine, crowd-free beaches in South Asia. While those looking to evoke the spirit a Kipling-style adventure should follow the ancient trade routes of the Khyber Pass, Grand Trunk Road and Karakoram Highway. 796,095 sq km (307,374 sq miles). 192,826,502 (UN estimate 2016). 250.1 per sq km. Islamabad. Federal Republic. President Asif Ali Zardari since 2024. Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif since 2024.","The territory of present day Pakistan has witnessed the rise and fall of countless empires, which have contested this land from as early as 550BCE, when the Achaemenid Empire controlled vast swathes of Asia, Arabian and Northern Africa. By 323BCE the marauding Macedonian, Alexander the Great, had staked his claim to Pakistan, setting a trend for conquering that continued for the next 2000 years. The Mughal Empire (1526-1857) lasted longest and helped develop the region economically. Agriculture, art and commerce flourished during Mughal rule, which left behind a sophisticated administration and a wealth of architecture that still wows visitors today. The British arrived in the region in the early 1800s and in 1849 the territory now known as Pakistan was incorporated into British India. It was not until 1947, as a result of a violent partition from India, that Pakistan acquired nationhood. Under pressure from Indian Muslims led by Mohammed Ali Jinnah - who is considered to be the 'father of the nation' - the British created a separate Muslim state consisting of two parts; East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) and West Pakistan (now a single unitary state), which were separated by 1,600km (1,000 miles) of Indian territory. Political and religious disputes between the territories resulted in a civil war, which lasted for most of 1971. It was brought to an end by the intervention of India, which forced Pakistan to surrender and recognise the independence of modern day Bangladesh. Pakistan’s relationship with India remains fraught. Both nations lay claim to Kashmir and have fought wars over the territory. Pakistan presently occupies one-third of the disputed territory and India occupies the other two-thirds. The Kashmiris themselves have become weary of both sides and there is a growing appetite for independence. In contrast to India, democracy failed to take root in Pakistan, which suffered prolonged periods of military rule. After decades of revolving-door politics followed by incompetence, nepotism and corruption, tackling Pakistan's huge political and economic problems remains tougher than ever. Although the country has struggled to maintain a foothold on political stability, Pakistan remains a politically aware nation, with a culture broadly based around family, Islam and an acceptance of different ethnic groups living throughout the country. Did you know? • Pakistan is home to the highest paved road in the world. Perched 4,693m (15,397ft) above sea level, the Karakoram Highway links China with Pakistan. • The name Pakistan means ‘land of the pure’ in Persian and Urdu. • Pakistan has the world’s largest volunteer ambulance service, founded by Sattar Edhi. 97% Muslim (77% Sunni, 20% Shi'a), the remainder are Ismaili Muslims (who follow the Aga Khan as their spiritual leader), Hindu or Christian. The right hand is used both for shaking hands (the usual form of greeting) and for passing or receiving things. Mutual hospitality and courtesy are of great importance at all levels, whatever the social standing of the host. Visitors must remember that most Pakistanis are Muslim and should respect their customs and beliefs. Smoking is prohibited in some public places and it is polite to ask permission before lighting a cigarette. It is common for visiting businesspeople to be entertained in hotels and restaurants. If invited to a private home, a gift or national souvenir is welcome. Informal dress is acceptable for most occasions. Women should avoid wearing tight clothing and both men and women should ensure that their arms and legs are covered. Pakistani society is divided into classes and within each group there is a subtle social grading. The Koran is the law for Muslims and it influences every aspect of daily life. Photography: Do not take photographs at military establishments, airports or of any infrastructure, including dams and bridges or from aircraft. The penalties can be severe. Urdu is the official language, though it is only used by 8% of Pakistanis. English is widely spoken. Regional languages include Punjabi, which is spoken by 48% of the population, Pashto, Sindhi, Saraiki and Balochi. There are numerous local dialects.","Pakistan has three seasons: winter (November to March) is warm and cooled by sea breezes on the coast; summer (April to July) has extreme temperatures and the monsoon season (July to September) has the highest rainfall on the hills. Karachi has little rain. Global warming is starting to become apparent in Pakistan with warmer winters, glacial melt and a slight dip in temperature in the summer months.The best time to visit southern Pakistan is between November and March, when the days are cool and clear. The best time to visit northern Pakistan, for trekking, is from April to October; outside of these months it will be snowy and very difficult to reach many mountainous places. Bear in mind that the monsoon plays havoc with travel in Pakistan and is not to be taken lightly, as we have witnessed recently with the devastating floods of 2010, which were the worst in 80 years. Wear lightweights, with warmer clothing, including base-layers and woollens, for upland areas in the winter. Good trekking boots are a must for mountain explorers, as are walking poles and thermals. Visitors can buy woollen socks and sweaters at a very good price in the bazaars of Pakistan, but they might not be up to western standards and will be quite heavy. Rainwear is advised for the monsoon season so if you are to spend any time in the cities during this time, do not rule out the possibility of bringing along some wellington boots as the rain can be torrential resulting in very flooded lanes. It's easiest to buy the necessary shalwar kameez (tunic and baggy trousers) when you land in Pakistan - this is essential for women, and optional, but advisable for the heat more than anything, for men. In the intense heat it may be tempting to lose layers – in respect of local customs, and to spare yourself unwanted harassment and disapproval, it is far wiser to cover up in cool, white flowing cottons, like the Pakistanis do, thus keeping the sun off too. Pakistan has borders to the north with Afghanistan, to the east with India and to the west with Iran; the Arabian Sea lies to the south. In the northeast is the disputed territory of Jammu and Kashmir, bounded by Afghanistan, China and India. The land covers a huge 796,096 sq km (305,058 sq miles) making it over three times the size of the UK. Pakistan comprises six distinct regions. There is the northern mountain area which has a high concentration of jaw-dropping peaks, and some of the largest glaciers outside of the polar regions - in fact five are over 45 km (28 miles) in length - as well as the Himalayan range which includes the fabled Nanga Parbat, which stands a whopping 8,125m (26,657ft) tall. The other regions are comprised by the northern plateau, which is effectively the lowlands at the bottom of the mountain ranges, the western mountains, the Balochistan plateau (which is hilly and very sparsely populated), the southeast desert which stretches into Rajasthan in India and the plain of the river Indus, which is within Sindh and the Punjab (‘Punjab’ literally means five waters, named after the Indus and it’s four tributaries)."
asia,philippines,"The other Southeast Asia, the Philippines is where Asia and Europe collide, over a sprawl of sand-circled tropical islands. Here, Catholic traditions meld with animist rituals and Islamic customs, creating a surreal melting pot that is unlike anywhere else in Southeast Asia. You can thank the Spanish for the European influence, tangible in everything from the names of towns and barrios (neighbourhoods) to restaurant menus, where roast pork and paella are as common as noodles and seafood. Later, the Americans imposed their own vision and values – you can thank the US for the fastfood chains, the love of pop music, and the rainbow-coloured jeepneys that serve as local buses, evolved from military jeeps left behind from WWII. With 7,107 islands, it’s hardly surprising that many of the Philippines’ most stunning attractions can be found in or around the sea. Boracay and other islands are ringed by some of the world’s most immaculate beaches and the waters offshore are a diver’s paradise, with pristine reefs, astounding tropical fish, migrating whale sharks and wrecks from WWII. There’s much more, though. Away from the beaches are jungles, mountains, volcanoes and hidden caverns ripe for exploration. The volcanic nature of the islands is highly obvious – natural hot springs bubble up across the Philippines and the pyramid peaks of live volcanoes such as Mount Mayon call out to trekkers who don’t mind living dangerously. It can’t been denied that the Philippines has a seedy side – the sex industry grew up to service American GIs during the Vietnam War – but it’s easy to avoid this gloomy scene and find more wholesome nightlife, where live bands perform note-perfect covers of any song you could name and even the smallest, palm-thatched village has a karaoke bar. This isn’t a country that stages dozens of phony cultural shows for tourists, and the islands’ vividly colourful festivals (of which there are many) are predominantly aimed at locals. So it’s down to individual visitors to strike up conversations and discover a country where East meets West and traditional culture meets the modern world in a crash of colour and confetti. 300,000 sq km (115,831 sq miles). 103,339,458 (UN estimate 2017). 348 per sq km.

President Bongbong Marcos since 2022.","Inhabited for some 250,000 years, by the time the Spanish arrived in the 16th century the islands had been trading with Chinese merchants for hundreds of years and Islamic settlers from Brunei lived in the south of the archipelago. The Spanish turned these disparate islands into a nation named in honour of King Phillip II and introduced Roman Catholicism, which had an impact that continues to be felt today, with most Filipinos identifying themselves as Catholics. Throughout the Spanish era, the mountain tribes struggled against colonial rule and a revolution began in 1896, but saw the Filipino forces defeated. The Spanish-American War (1898) ended with the USA taking possession of the Philippines, sparking the three-year Philippine-American War (1899-1902) during which atrocities were committed on both sides. The American occupiers were resisted for many years, but did improve standards of education and infrastructure and finally allowed elections and commonwealth status in 1935. In WWII, the Japanese occupied the country and many of the major cities were devastated. After the war, the Philippines became one of the founding members of the United Nations and democracy was restored. In 1965 Ferdinand Marcos was elected president and, together with his wife Imelda, set out to modernise the country and rein in the elite families which had long dominated the Philippines. He declared martial law in 1972, strengthening his grip on power and ruthlessly crushing dissent while plundering the country’s coffers. Marcos was deposed in 1986 at the hands of a popular uprising led by Cory Aquino, the wife of assassinated presidential rival Ninoy. Initial euphoria about a return to democracy turned to scepticism as successive administrations were accused of corruption, cronyism and self-interest. Today wealth distribution remains very uneven, which goes some way to explaining the high number of Filipinos working abroad and sending money home. Did you know? •	The Beatles played two sell-out shows to 80,000 people in Manila on 4 July 1966, but inadvertently missed a presidential reception. The next day they were spat at and jostled as they left the country vowing never to return. •	The Philippines was the first Southeast Asian country to win an Olympic medal. •	The country is one of the most biologically diverse nations on the planet, home to more than 100 mammal and 170 bird species, which are not found elsewhere. Roman Catholic 86%; the rest are made up mostly of Muslims, other Christian denominations, Buddhists and Taoists. Government officials are addressed by their titles such as senator, congressman or director. Otherwise, usual modes of address and levels of politeness are expected. Casual dress is acceptable in most places, but in Muslim areas the visitor should cover up. Filipino men may wear an embroidered long-sleeved shirt or a plain white barong tagalog with black trousers for formal occasions, women wear cocktail dresses or long gowns. The Philippines are, in many respects, more westernised than any other Asian country, but there is a rich underlay of Malay culture. This is reflected, for example, in a concern for preserving amor propia (face) which makes direct confrontation a social taboo. Smoking: There is a nationwide smoking ban in force in public places that are frequented by minors and young people like schools, universities, youth hostels, recreational facilities, hospitals, clinics and public kitchens. Filipino (based on Tagalog) is the national language, although it is the native tongue of less than a quarter of the population. English is widely spoken, Spanish much less so. There are around 170 indigenous languages in total, with hundreds more dialects.","The Philippines is hot year-round but sea breezes can add freshness during the winter (November to February). The typhoon season lasts from around July to October, although in recent years it seems to have been starting and finishing later – in 2010 for example there was severe flooding in North Luzon as late as November. Rainfall patterns vary across the country. In Manila, Palawan and Coron, for example, most rain occurs in the typhoon season. Other areas (including much of the Bicol region) have no distinct dry season, with the most rain from December to February. The Visayas have only a short dry season from November to January, while in Leyte and Bohol, rainfall levels don’t change much throughout the year. Travellers should therefore check the local climate before making plans. Most tourists visit from January to May (and particularly the first half of that period) when most of the country is undergoing its best climatic conditions. Surfers, on the other hand, are attracted to the islands during the typhoon season as it brings the biggest waves. Lightweight cottons and linens are worn throughout most of the year, with warmer clothes useful on cooler evenings. Rainwear or umbrellas are advisable for the rainy season. The Philippines lie off the southeast coast of Asia between Taiwan and Borneo in the Pacific Ocean and South China Sea. They are composed of 7,107 islands and islets (7,108 at low tide), 2,773 of which are named. The two largest islands, Luzon in the north and Mindanao in the south, account for 65% of the total land area and contain 60% of the country's population. Between the two lie the Visayas Islands."
asia,singapore,"Once routinely criticised for being dull, Singapore has reinvented itself as one of Southeast Asia’s most modern and dynamic cities. Melding together a mass of different cultures, cuisines and architectural styles, the city-state is now studded with vast new showpiece constructions to complement its colonial-era hotels and civic buildings. Cutting-edge tourist developments continue to spring up. Shopping avenues and underground malls throb with life, as do the food courts, the riverside bars and the temple-dotted outlying neighbourhoods. It’s never going to be Bangkok, but it’s doing a fantastic job of being Singapore. Chinese, Indian, Malay and European influences all flow through daily life here. Boring? Hardly. It’s true to say, however, that the former British trading post and colony still has a reputation for its cleanliness (it’s still panned for its seemingly petty regulations, such as the banning of chewing gum). Likewise, levels of serious crime are very low. It’s worth pointing out, too, that Singapore’s cultural mix has left it with a genuinely world-class food scene – and you won’t need to spend big to eat well. Recent years have seen the city really pushing for recognition as an international tourist destination in its own right, rather than as a convenient stopover. Significant investment has resulted in developments such as Marina Bay Sands, the three-towered skyscraper that now stands as Singapore’s centrepiece; Resorts World Sentosa, which is home to a Universal Studios theme park; and Gardens by the Bay, a remarkable project complete with “supertrees” and two colossal plant domes. More traditional attractions include the designer malls of Orchard Road, the exotic clatter of Chinatown and Little India and the elegance of Raffles Hotel, still standing proud more than 125 years after being built. On the subject of hotels, Singapore now offers one of the best spreads of high-end accommodation in the region: a sign, amongst other things, of its ambition to keep visitors flooding in. It’s likely to succeed. 697 sq km (269 sq miles). 5,696,506 (UN estimate 2016). 7,987.5 per sq km. Singapore. Republic. President Tharman Shanmugaratnam since 2023. Prime Minister Lawrence Wong since 2024.","Today considered one of South East Asia’s economic success stories, the island of Singapore has a long history of trade – certainly Chinese merchants were visiting many centuries before the arrival of the first European colonists and at various times the island fell under the influence of competing kingdoms based in what are now Indonesia and Malaysia. The Portuguese arrived in the region early in the 16th century, taking Melaka (on west coast) as their trading port. The Dutch followed, as did the British who took an interest in Singapore following the end of the Napoleonic Wars in 1818. Under plans drawn up by Sir Stamford Raffles, Singapore was to be turned into a major port alongside Melaka and Penang, both of which were by then under British control. Although Raffles spent little time in the city, his decisions – such as dividing the city along ethnic lines – were crucial to its development. Under the British, Chinese and Indian immigrants flocked to Singapore. Living conditions were often dreadful, but there was money to be made and the city-state became known for a work ethic, which is evident to this day. As in the other settlements a mixed-ancestry community, the Peranakan, arose after Chinese men married local women. Japan took Singapore in World War 2 to the dismay of its colonial rulers. Conditions under the occupation were harsh for POWs and civilians alike and thousands of Chinese inhabitants were executed. After the Japanese surrender, British rule was re-established before Singapore achieved independence in 1963 as part of the Malay Federation until Singapore was expelled in 1965. Under the leadership of Lee Kuan Yew, who was prime minister from 1959 to 1990, the country attracted huge foreign investment but developed a repressive – though generally popular – single party political system. In recent years Singapore has taken a more active role in regional affairs and there has been some improvement in relations between Singapore and Malaysia, whose myriad disputes number access to air space, water resources and territorial boundaries. Did you know? • When Lee Kuan Yew died in January 2015, some 1.7 people paid tribute to him at his lying-in-state and at community centre around the island during a week of mourning. • The island’s Chinese, Malay, Indian and Western Festivals are all national holidays. Buddhist 33%, Christian 18%, Muslim 15%, Taoist 11% and Hindu 5%. Handshaking is the usual form of greeting, regardless of race; Muslims, and some Hindus, would not however normally shake hands with someone of the opposite sex. Social courtesies are often fairly formal. When invited to a private home or entering a temple or mosque, remove your shoes. For private visits, a gift is appreciated and, if on business, a company souvenir is appropriate. Dress is informal. Most first-class restaurants and some hotel dining rooms expect men to wear a jacket and tie in the evenings; a smart appearance is expected for business meetings. Laws relating to jaywalking, littering and chewing gum are strictly enforced in urban areas. Smoking is widely discouraged and illegal in enclosed public places (including restaurants). Dropping a cigarette end in the street or smoking illegally can lead to an immediate fine. The official languages are Mandarin Chinese, English, Malay and Tamil. Most Singaporeans are bilingual and speak English, which is used as the main language of communication.","Located just north of the equator, Singapore has a tropical climate and stays hot and humid throughout the year. Temperatures average around 31º C (88º F) during the day with little seasonal variation, although it’s slightly cooler in December and January, and hottest in April and May. Temperatures are unlikely to dip below 23º C (74º F) at night; the lowest temperature ever recorded was just over 19º C (66º F). Singapore receives a considerable amount of rainfall - approximately 2340mm annually. Although there are no distinct wet or dry seasons, the region is affected by two different monsoons. The Northeast Monsoon generally takes place from December to March and is accompanied by more frequent rain, particularly from November to January. Conversely, the Southwest Monsoon produces a marginally dryer climate from May to September. Despite the slightly lower overall precipitation levels, particularly from June to August, the Southwest Monsoon is characterized by its early-morning rainstorms; these often persist for one or two hours then taper off for the afternoon. Even these drier months experience a fair amount of rain (around 150mm each month), so be prepared for unpredictably wet weather any time of the year. The beginning and end of the two monsoon seasons are not well defined, but are separated by the shorter inter-monsoon periods of April/May and October/November, during which months afternoon and evening rain showers are likely. These showers are typically sudden and heavy, but often only last for a short time. The region is extremely humid, with humidity levels usually between 70% and 90%; often the air is muggiest in the early morning, abating somewhat in the afternoon. On rainy days it is not unreasonable to expect the humidity to reach 100%. When visiting, be sure to drink enough water and seek frequent refuge from the sticky heat indoors. March and September are particularly humid and often very uncomfortable. Thunderstorms are also a very regular phenomenon, occurring on roughly 40% of all days year-round but particularly common during the Southeast Monsoon. In fact, this small city-state has one of the highest rates of lightning activity worldwide. Despite the unpredictability of the weather, Singapore experiences as much brilliant sunshine as it does rain, and therefore makes for a delightful beach destination. If sunbathing happens to be interrupted by an unexpected shower, there is at least a plethora of indoor entertainment. As Singapore’s weather does not vary drastically throughout the year, tourism in the area is relatively steady year-round. The weather can be erratic and unpredictable, so it may be best to plan a visit based on the festival season rather than the climate; some of the nation’s most notable are the grand celebrations of Chinese New Year, the Lantern Festival and the Art Festival. Accommodation prices rise significantly during the Formula One racing. Be sure to pack lightweight cottons and linens to avoid becoming overheated in the muggy Singapore climate. Also remember to carry an umbrella any time of year, but particularly during the rainy season. The island of Singapore is situated off the southern extremity of the Malay Peninsula, separated from the mainland by the Johor Strait which is about 1km (0.8 miles) wide. Causeways run across the strait carrying roads, a railway and water pipes. The main island is mainly flat with only low hills, the highest being Bukit Timah at 166m (545ft). In the northeast of the island, and in the urban district, large areas have been reclaimed, and much of the original jungle and swamp covering the low-lying areas has been cleared. In addition to the main island, the Republic of Singapore includes more than 60 much smaller islands and islets."
asia,south-korea,"South Korea can come across as inscrutable at first glance. It’s a land of stark contrasts and wild contradictions; a place where tradition and technology are equally embraced; where skyscrapers loom over ancient temples; and where the frantic pace of life is offset by the serenity of nature. The country’s unique customs and etiquette can seem like a trap laid for foreigners, but arrive with a smile and a respectful attitude and you will be welcomed with open arms by some of the friendliest folk on the planet. Koreans are fiercely proud of their country, and with good reason. The Korean peninsula has a storied history and this colourful heritage is woven into the fabric of this land. The capital, Seoul, is home to a number of historic highlights, including the spectacular Joseon-era Gyeongbokgung Palace, “the great south gate” of Namdaemun and the eerie Seodaemun Prison – all tucked away amid gleaming offices, giant shopping centres, world-class restaurants and hipster bars. The rest of the country is also littered with fortresses, temples and palaces. Visitors will enjoy the grassy burial mounds of ancient kings in Gyeongju, the Seokbulsa Temple in Busan, which has been carved out of a rock, and the infamous demilitarised zone, a biodiverse no-man’s-land separating South and North Korea. It is a scary place, where acres of barbed wire are patrolled by heavily-armed guards on both sides, yet the tension is so trumped up it feels like you’ve stumbled onto a Hollywood film set. But it's not all about history. When it comes to nature, South Korea is wonderfully diverse, with spectacular national parks, remote sandy beaches, hot spring islands and rugged mountain peaks. Gastronomes are well catered for, too, but you may have to open your mind before your mouth; local specialities include kimchi (pickled cabbage) and makgeolli (rice wine). South Korea can sometimes seem like the most foreign place on Earth; an unfathomable destination of curious customs, strange food and jarring paradoxes. Ultimately, that’s what makes it so exciting. 99,720 sq km (38,502 sq miles) excluding demilitarised zone. 50,503,933 (UN estimate 2016). 492.5 per sq km. Seoul. Republic. President Yoon Suk-yeol since 2022. Han Duck-soo since 2022.","The first unified Korea was under the Silla, a Gyeongju-based empire that stretched over most of the peninsula. The empire fragmented in CE 870, giving way to the Koryo dynasty, who allied themselves with the Song dynasty in China. The Koryo emulated the Song in establishing an advanced cultural and technological society (including the invention of printing in 1234, two centuries before its discovery in the West). The peninsula fell to the Mongols in the 1230s. It took until the early 14th century, and the assistance of the Chinese Ming dynasty, to recover Korean independence. The Koryo dynasty was followed by the Choson in the 14th century, who governed Korea until the early 20th century. The early years of the Choson saw Korea enter a period of outstanding cultural and intellectual achievement; however, during this time, the country suffered invasions by the Japanese and then the Chinese Manchu dynasty. At the end of WWII, the Soviets and Americans agreed to divide Korea along latitude 38°N (the 38th parallel). As the Cold War evolved, a full-scale war broke out between the two sides in 1950. The three-year war engaged all the major powers and came closer than is often realised to provoking a nuclear conflagration. By 1953, a stalemate had been reached and an armistice was signed. For the next three decades, locked into opposing Cold War blocs, the two Koreas went their separate ways. South Korea developed a successful capitalist economy, but its political system was far from democratic: until the 1980s the country was run by a series of dictators who punished political dissent with imprisonment. However, the country's political leaders, with their powerbase in the monopolistic Democratic Justice Party, realised that some relaxation of the existing tight political control was necessary. So in 1981, martial law was lifted and within five years, a powerful parliamentary opposition had emerged in the form of the New Korea Democratic Party (NKDP), led by the veteran dissident Kim Dae-Jung. North-South relations hit a new nadir in 2010 with the sinking of a South Korean warship (and the deaths of 46 sailors on board), which put any hopes of reunification on hold. After a series of skirmishes in 2015, the two sides agreed a deal to defuse tensions. President Park Guen-hye, the first female president of South Korea, was elected in 2013 but impeached at the end of 2016 over a corruption scandal. Unlike her predecessors, she strove for a close relationship with the USA and spoke of wishing to unify the two Koreas. She was succeeded by Moon Jae-in in 2017. A former human rights lawyer and the son of North Korean refugees, the new president is known for his liberal views. The region’s tumultuous history remains very much a part of present day South Korea and is something many Koreans feel strongly about – after a few sojus, the topic can get heated. Did you know? •	Koreans count ages differently than we do in the West: when babies are born, they are considered to be one already. Every year at New Year’s (and not on their birthdays), they turn a year older. •	Until 2015, adultery was a criminal offence that could result in prison. •	The five most popular Korean surnames - Kim, Lee, Park, Choi and Chong – are used by more than half of the population. •	Though a ceasefire was signed in 1952, technically, the Korean War has never officially ended. This is one of the world's most homogeneous populations, but faith is divided largely between Christianity (27.6%) and the country's traditional faith of Buddhism (15.5%), with 56.9% of no formal religion. Confucian philosophy is generally followed out of generational habit, while Shamanism and the belief in ghosts and spirits are also strong. Cheondogyo is a Korean faith that has grown up out of Taoism, Confucianism and Christianity, and there is a small Islamic population. Shoes must be removed before entering a Korean home. Small gifts are customary; traditional etiquette requires using the right hand for giving and receiving. Seniority should always be respected - don't eat before the oldest person at the table has started.  Koreans often ask your age and marital status to quickly gauge societal seniority. They can be very reserved, shy and resistant of body contact until they get to know you. Never leave chopsticks in your rice, and never beckon anyone with palm up using one finger, as this is the way Koreans call their dogs. Writing someone's name in red is bad as this symbolises death. The number four is considered unlucky and to give gifts in multiples of four is considered taboo; giving seven of an item is considered lucky. Traditional costume, or hanbok, is mainly worn on holidays and special occasions. For men it consists of a short jacket and loose trousers, called baji, that are tied at the ankles. Women's hanboks comprise a wrap-around skirt and a bolero-style jacket and is often called a chima-jeogori. Korean (Hangul), with English widely taught in school and generally understood in major centres.","Moderate climate with four seasons, making any season a fine time to visit as long as you wear appropriate clothing. The hottest part of the year is during the rainy season between July and August, and the coldest is December to February. Occasional typhoons bring high winds and floods. Spring and autumn are mild and mainly dry and are generally considered the best times to visit. Lightweight cottons and linens are worn during summer, with light- to mediumweights in spring and autumn. Medium- to heavyweights are advised during the winter. The Republic of Korea (South Korea) is a peninsula that shares borders to the north with the demilitarised zone (separating it from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea), to the east with the Sea of Japan (East Sea), to the south with the Korea Strait (separating it from Japan), and to the west with the Yellow Sea. There are many islands and bays in the Korea Strait, including the largest, the volcanic island of Jeju-do, which lies off the southwest coast and is also home to South Korea's highest mountain, Mount Halla, at 1,950m (6,397ft). Most of the country consists of hills and mountains with the 30% of flat plain home to the majority of the population and cultivation. Most rivers rise in the mountains to the east, flowing west and south to the Yellow Sea. The Naktong River flows into the Korea Strait near the southern port of Busan, Korea's second largest city after Seoul. The eastern coast is rocky and steep with mountains rising from the sea."

Monsoon winds create the seasons, rainbow-coloured fishing boats deliver the bounty of the Indian Ocean to the nation’s tables and tropical surf washes endlessly against the island’s golden beaches. For many, this is the perfect introduction to the Indian Subcontinent. While Hinduism holds sway in nearby India, Buddhism dominates Sri Lanka. Ancient temples and enigmatic dagobas (stupas) enshrine relics of Buddha, shaded by saplings taken from the tree under which the Buddha attained enlightenment. At times, Sri Lanka’s Hindu, Christian and Buddhist minorities have struggled in the face of Buddhist domination, but it has shaped this island nation for millennia. Across Sri Lanka, the ruins of ancient cities emerge from the jungle, while the remnants of Indian, Portuguese, Dutch and British settlements add to the delightful mishmash of historic architecture. Perhaps the most evocative monuments are Sri Lanka’s ancient monasteries, which are still major centres for pilgrimage and devotion, particularly during the island’s epic festivals. In the Hill Country, the centre of the British occupation, colonial-era trains still wind their way through tea plantations and cascading paddy fields, but this highly populated little island is far from frozen in time: the coastline is peppered with modern resorts, beach bars, bronzed surfers and boutiques full of designer swimwear. Elsewhere the forests of Yala, Udawalawe and other national parks teem with monkeys, leopards and wild elephants, while sea turtles, dolphins and blue whales can be spotted around the coast. Not bad for an island similar in size to South Carolina. 65,610 sq km (25,332 sq miles). 20,995,130 (UN estimate 2018). 335 per sq km. Colombo. Republic. President Ranil Wickremesinghe since 2022. Prime Minister Dinesh Gunawardene since 2022.","Woven through Sri Lanka’s absorbing history is a story of strife between the country’s two biggest ethnic groups: the Buddhist Sinhalese and the Hindu and Muslim Tamils. Almost every ancient site has two conflicting legends surrounding it, and historians often struggle to distinguish fact from myth. What is generally agreed is that Buddhism arrived on the island in the 3rd century BC, reputedly carried here by the son of the Indian emperor Ashoka. The earliest Sri Lankan civilisation was based around the city of Anuradhapura, which still endures as an atmospheric ruin, along with its successor city, Polonnaruwa. The collapse of Polonnaruwa after more than two centuries saw Sinhalese power shift to the southwest of the island, creating a cultural split with the largely Tamil coastal settlements in the north, who looked to India for guidance. This historical division survived the colonising attempts of the Portuguese, Dutch and British, and continued through WWII and independence from British colonial rule in 1948. Increasing centralisation of power within the Sinhalese community and marginalisation of Tamils led to riots in the 1950s and ultimately civil war. By the early 1980s the Sinhalese government were locked in a seemingly endless cycle of violence with the rebel organisation that came to be known as the Tamil Tigers. A long-awaited deal between Sri Lanka's government and the rebel Tamil Tigers (LTTE) was concluded in early 2002, but fighting became much more serious in 2006 and much of the country became no-go areas for tourists, particularly the Tamil heartland in the north of the island. In 2009, the government escalated their offensive, and succeeded in killing the leader of the LTTE, Velupillai Prabhakran, bringing 26 years of conflict to an end. Since then, peace has endured, but allegations persist of civilian massacres and human rights violations by both sides, but particularly by government forces, in the final years of the conflict. Many international politicians have called for an independent enquiry into war crime allegations, and this may finally materialise with the change of leadership from the militaristic Mahinda Rajapaksa to the more conciliatory Maithripala Sirisena. Still, this vibrant little island has proved adept at bouncing back from adversity. Over a decade on from the Boxing Day tsunami in 2004, which killed more than 30,000 people across the country and destroyed many coastal towns, the country is powering ahead of the rest of the region both socially and economically. With tourism booming and infrastructure expanding, the future of Sri Lanka looks bright. Did you know? •	Though Sri Lankans are mad about cricket, the national sport is actually volleyball. •	Cinnamon originally comes from Sri Lanka and is used in many local dishes. •	Sri Lanka was known as Ceylon until 1972. The majority of the Sinhalese population practises Buddhism (70%). Minority religions include Hinduism (almost exclusively practised by the Tamil population), Christianity, with the majority denomination being Roman Catholic (around 6% of the population as opposed to 0.8% who are Anglicans) and Islam (practised by around 10% of the population). Shaking hands is the normal manner of greeting, and it is also common to see people greet by bringing both hands together and saying ""Ayubowan"" which means ""have a long life"" when they first meet with someone. It is customary to be offered tea when visiting and considered impolite to refuse. Punctuality is always appreciated, although it may not be reciprocated as the concept of time is a little loose. If visiting someone's home, or place of business, bring a small gift is appreciated. When visiting Buddhist temples, modest clothing should be worn (don't show bare legs and upper arms). Shoes and hats must be removed when entering places of worship too. Jackets and ties are not required by men except for formal functions when lightweight suits should be worn. Women may choose a dress or opt for a blouse with a shirt or pair of toursers. Expect a significant amount of head waggling which can mean yes, no or maybe. Public displays of affection between couples are frowned upon while public nudity and homosexuality are illegal. The major languages spoken are Sinhala and Tamil. English is spoken by around 10% of the population, and a further small minority speak Portuguese Creole, a hangover from colonial times.","Sri Lanka’s climate is tropical and consists of distinct wet and dry seasons. Generally speaking, the coastal areas of Sri Lanka enjoy temperatures averaging 28°C (82°F) while the upland areas are cooler and more temperate, with a yearly average around 16-20°C (60-68°F). The best time to visit Sri Lanka depends on where you go. The best time to visit the southwest region of Sri Lanka The best time to visit the southwest region of Sri Lanka is from December to April. During this time, the weather is warm; the city of Galle on the southwestern tip enjoys an average high of 29°C (84°F) for example. However, the Yala monsoon brings abundant rainfall to the southwest region from May to September, and to November in some coastal cities. The best time to visit the northeast region of Sri Lanka The best time to visit the northeast region of Sri Lanka is from May to September. The sun-drenched Trincomalee, a port city on the northeast coast of Sri Lanka, enjoys a balmy temperatures of 30°C (86°F) with little rain during this period. However, the Maha monsoon affects Sri Lanka’s northeast region from October to January. The best time to visit Colombo Sri Lanka’s largest city is hot, wet and humid year-round. The city receives abundant rainfall from April to May, then again from September to November. In terms of temperatures, Colombo enjoys an average high of 30°C (87°F) and an average low of 24°C (75°F) year round. The best time to visit Kandy and the central hill region Kandy is a major tourist destination in the Central Province, a mountainous area of Sri Lanka. Sitting at an elevation of 500m (1,600ft), Kandy is considerably cooler than the coastal regions of Sri Lanka with temperatures averaging between 23-26°C (73-79°F) year-round. Rainfall is expected throughout the year, but it tends to be heavy in October and November. The best time to visit Kandy is from January to March as the weather is mild and the rainfall is at its lowest. Please note that there is also an inter-monsoonal period in October and November during which rain and thunderstorms occur frequently across the island. So always pack an umbrella with you. The weather in Sri Lanka can be unpredictable during any season so depending on where in the country you're going, it's best to take layers. The central highlands can be significantly cooler throughout the year, so you'll need warmer clothes here. Lightweight rainwear is also recommended any time of year. Sri Lanka is an island off the southeast coast of the Indian state of Tamil Nadu. It is separated from India by the Indian Ocean, in which lies the chain of islands called Adam's Bridge. Sri Lanka has an irregular surface with low-lying coastal plains running inland from the northern and eastern shores. The central and southern areas slope into the hills and mountains ranges of the Central Highlands. The highest peak is Pidurutalagala, which reaches an altitude of 2,524m (8,281ft). The country’s coast consistx mainly of beaches and bays, with rocky cliffs in the northeast and southwest. Due to the southwestern location of the mountain range, precipitation is heavily weighted towards this area, with the the northern and eastern parts fall in the rain shadow of the Central Highlands. The wettest parts of the country in the south and west receive around 4,000mm of rainfall annually. There are two major national parks, in the northwest and southeast, designated as such to protect the immense biodiversity of the country’s wildlife."
asia,taiwan,"Sitting pretty as one of Asia’s best-kept travel secrets, the spicy, scenic island of Taiwan makes a habit of smashing visitor preconceptions. Outsiders tend to see this country as notable only for its technological prowess – an image reinforced by the global prominence of ‘Made in Taiwan’ stickers – but in reality this is a destination that serves up awe-inspiring panoramas, a rainbow of different cultures and a startlingly rich history. Alongside night markets, cycle trails and hot springs, there are gleaming skyscrapers, hulking mountains and sparkling lakes. When you factor in the manageable size of the island, which is less than half the size of Scotland, the appeal becomes even more significant. Taiwan is one of the few places on Earth where ancient religious and cultural practices still thrive in an overwhelmingly modernist landscape. This juxtaposition is expressed most clearly in Taipei, where futuristic marvels like Taipei 101 – one of the tallest buildings in the world – share the city with incense-fogged temples and indigenous communities. This mix of different influences is wonderfully showcased by the island’s cuisine – a lip-smacking blend of Chinese, Japanese and aboriginal fare. Like many aspects of life in Taiwan, its diverse cuisine makes sense when you look at the island’s history. Following five decades of Japanese rule, in 1949 a liberated Taiwan became a refuge for the Chinese Nationalist Party and their supporters, who fled here during the Chinese Civil War. To this day, Taiwan remains a product of this period – a maverick sovereign state still viewed with uneasiness by Beijing. History buff or not, there’s much to enjoy in Taiwan. Away from the sleek towers of the cities, it’s the valleys, lakes and gorges of the countryside that tend to leave the greatest impression. The fact that comparatively few tourists make it here is more to do with a lack of awareness than a lack of things to do – hikers, cyclists, divers, surfers, pilgrims and gourmands will all find a little slice of heaven in this corner of Asia. 36,188 sq km (13,972 sq miles). 23,395,600 (UN estimate 2016). 647 per sq km. Taipei. Republic. President Lai Ching-te since 2024. Premier Cho Jung-tai since 2024.","Indigenous tribes have inhabited the region for some 4,000 years, with Chinese settlements springing up in the 16th century. It subsequently attracted European colonists, with the Dutch and Spanish both putting down roots. In 1684, Taiwan was taken over by the deposed Ming Dynasty, before becoming completely controlled by the Qing Dynasty and made a province in its own right. In the 1890s, Chinese defeat in the first Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895) brought the first occupation of Chinese territory by the Japanese and Taiwan was ceded to Japan, in perpetuity, in the Treaty of Shimonoseki. Although it was fiercely resented and resisted by the population, Taiwan remained under Japanese rule from 1895 until the end of WWII. The Chinese Civil War (1927-1950), which had already been in progress for some years, came to a head in 1948 as Mao's Communists defeated Chiang Kai-Shek and his nationalist forces. The nationalist leadership, along with thousands of supporters, fled to Taiwan where their political vehicle, the Kuo Min-Tang (KMT) rapidly came to dominate. Having ensured its own survival, the KMT set about developing Taiwan’s economy with spectacular success, helping the small island nation become one of the fast developing 'tiger economies' of the Pacific Rim. Politically, Taiwan relied for a long time upon the support of the USA until the early 1970s, when a rapprochement between Washington and Beijing took place, the USA effectively shifting its allegiance from Taiwan to China. The Chinese still consider Taiwan to be part of their national territory and continue to harbour the long-term objective of reunifying Taiwan with the mainland. International recognition of Taiwan by the United Nations is therefore unacceptable to Beijing, but for all their political disagreements, extensive trade, travel and communications links have built up between Taiwan and China since the early 1970s. Taiwan continues to call itself the Republic of China, a name the People’s Republic of China finds more acceptable than official recognition of an independent Taiwan. Did you know? •	Although official People’s Republic of China policy is to reunify China, in recent years it has pursued a form of unification through Deng Xiaoping’s principle of ‘One Country, Two Systems’. •	Taiwan uses two official calendars – the Gregorian and the Minguo, which began in 1911 with the founding of the Republic of China. •	Taiwan competes as Chinese Taipei at the Olympic Games and the FIFA World Cup. 'Folk religion' - a blend of ancient animist beliefs with the traditions of Taoism, Buddhism and Confucianism - forms the core beliefs of most Taiwanese. Purer forms of Buddhism are also on the rise, along with Christianity. Due to the work of Western missionaries in centuries gone by, many aboriginal Taiwanese are Christians. Despite Taiwan's complex ethnic and cultural mix, its way of life is predominantly Chinese, steeped in tradition and marked by superstition. As such, ancient customs and festivals are celebrated with fervour, and traditional holidays are closely observed. Taiwanese people are on the whole extremely friendly, and standards of hospitality are high. Entertainment is more commonly offered in restaurants than in private homes, and visitors are not usually expected to entertain. Handshaking is common, and casual wear is widely acceptable. As is the case in mainland China, the official language of Taiwan is Mandarin Chinese, commonly referred to as guoyu ('national language'). However, the native Taiwanese tongue, alternatively called taiyu or minnan hua, is still widely spoken as a first language by the island's dominant ethnic group, which originally hails from China's southern Fujian province. Hakka Chinese and various aboriginal dialects are still spoken too.","Despite the island’s relatively small size, the fact that Taiwan is bisected by the Tropic of Cancer means weather conditions can vary considerably from the north to the south. There’s a subtropical climate with moderate temperatures in the north, where rain is common in the winter months. The southern areas, where temperatures are higher on average, are less prone to rain. Summer can be uncomfortably hot across the island, making autumn and spring great times to come calling. The typhoon season usually comes into effect in late summer and makes itself felt most forcefully on the east coast, although in some years the phenomenon is far more active than in others. It might sound tempting to visit during the Chinese New Year celebrations, but while you’re likely to experience some spectacular revelry, you should be aware that accommodation prices always sky-rocket and many businesses and service providers shut down for the period. Light- to mediumweights, with rainwear advised. It’s a good idea not to wear overly skimpy clothing when visiting some of the stricter Buddhist temples, although light trousers and a t-shirt will always be considered perfectly acceptable for both sexes. It’s a wise idea to pack swimwear for the hot springs, although some single-sex bathing areas require no costume to be worn. Bring a pair of sturdy shoes too – even if you’re not intending to go trekking, there are some enjoyable short walks to be had at natural attractions like Taroko Gorge. Though Taiwanese territory includes dozens of small islands in the Taiwan Strait and the Pacific, the main island known as Taiwan covers the vast majority of the land area under Taiwanese administration. Almost two-thirds of Taiwan is covered by mountains, with 258 peaks over 3,000m (9,850ft), most of them heavily forested. The highest of these, Yushan (Jade Mountain), is northeast Asia's tallest mountain at 3,952m (13,042ft). This mountainous terrain is the result of the island’s location – it sits on the fault line of two tectonic plates, and was formed after a dramatic geological upheaval between four and five million years ago. It also sits on the Tropic of Cancer, putting it on the same line of latitude as Hawaii in the North Pacific. But while mountains dominate Taiwan's centre and rugged east coast, the island's western third is mostly alluvial plain and is host to most of the population. The two Pacific islands, Lyudao (Green Island) and Lanyu (Orchid Island), are popular holiday destinations, while the Taiwan Strait archipelagos of Penghu and Matzu hold historic and cultural appeal. And just a few kilometres off mainland China's Fujian coast, the tiny islands of Kinmen and Lieyu remain under Taiwanese control. The combination of climate, terrain and topography also makes the main island of Taiwan ripe for endemic flora and fauna, particularly in the diverse mountain forests. The Taiwan fir tree and Formosan black bear are two key examples. There’s also a rich bird life to enjoy, with various specialist tours available."
asia,tajikistan,"Following in the footsteps of ancient Silk Road traders, modern travellers come to Tajikistan to experience a magical journey across the ‘Roof of the World,’ a land of soaring mountain ranges, deep ravines and high-altitude deserts. Although Tajikistan is one of the most remote countries in the world, even its most inaccessible nooks host life; the mountains and deserts are home to Kyrgyz nomads, who eke out simple, self-sufficient lives as they have done for generations. Intrepid travellers will endure some of the coldest temperatures on the planet to visit them, but these chilly conditions are tempered by the Kyrgyz’s warm hospitality. An independent state since 1991, Tajikistan spent much of the last two centuries under Tsarist and Soviet rule. Ethnic Tajiks form the majority of the population, but there are also minority ethnic groups of Russian, Uzbek and Kyrgyz origin – a mix brought about by Stalin’s “divide and conquer” strategy. Tajikistan’s landscapes are just as dramatic as its political history. In the mountainous west, lofty peaks plunge into deep valleys where villages cling precariously to the cliffs-side above fast flowing rivers. In these settlements, where most of the population are subsidence farmers, any available patch of land is terraced and cultivated with potatoes, cabbage and wheat. Over in the east, the mountains plateau into a vast, high-altitude desert that looks like the surface of the moon. This is a hostile part of the world, as Marco Polo noted when he travelled through the region. “No birds fly here because of the height and the cold,” he wrote. Most arrive in Tajikistan via its capital, Dushanbe, one of the prettier cities in Central Asia with its gilded palaces, leafy parks and neoclassical facades. Emerging from the shadows of Soviet rule, Dushanbe is desperate to impress; it boasts the largest teahouse and tallest flagpole in the world, which are, aside from a few museums and markets, about the extent of its attractions. But Tajikistan isn’t about the destination, it’s about the journey; a journey through history and geography, where warm a welcome awaits those intrepid enough to visit. 143,100 sq km (55,251 sq miles). 8,669,464 (UN estimate 2016). 57.2 per sq km. Dushanbe. Republic. President Emomali Rahmon since 1994. Prime Minister Qohir Rasulzoda since 2013.","Strictly speaking, the history of Tajikistan as a nation begins as recently as 1991, when the Tajik Soviet Socialist Republic (part of the former USSR) became an independent country. Sadly the new country immediately fell into civil war – a bloody and unpleasant conflict involving divided ethnic factions, regions and ideologies. The war ended with the signing of a peace accord in 1997 and the appointment of President Emomalii Rahmon. The topic of the civil war is still simmering under the surface in Tajikistan in some quarters and relics of those times do still remain. Human activity in Tajikistan can be traced back as far as 6500BC, when Neolithic cave dwellers settled in the mountains. All the communities that have subsequently attempted habitation of the region – which is characterised by its remoteness and harsh climate – have endured tough conditions and, consequently, only the hardy few have made it their home. The first traveller of global consequence to the region was Alexander the Great. He travelled through present day western Tajikistan, marrying the infamous Roxana to cement local relations. His army made a number of forays into the Fann Mountains and Western Pamir, chasing down local marauders and searching for an eastward route through those ranges towards present day India. Various myths abound regarding how far the scouting parties got in their search beyond the then ‘known’ world. There are fables suggesting that some garrisons remained in the valleys of the Western Pamir, which might attempt to explain the real and obvious ethnic diversity of these present day communities – to this day you can see European faces with blond or red hair colour in isolated valleys. In the 8th Century the region was conquered by the Umayyad Empire, hailing from Mecca. The incursion first introduced the Islamic religion to the region – a heritage that has survived waves of successive empires from Mongol, Timurid, Persian, Tsarist and, lastly, Soviet origin. Another globally renowned traveller, Marco Polo, made a dent in Tajik history in successfully establishing an international trade connection through the Pamir. That embryonic ‘Silk Road’ would actually become a network of routes through the region and Polo was able to document and reveal the scale of the geographic barrier that was the Pamir range, which had defeated Alexander over 1500 years before. His exploration was subsequently followed five more centuries later by Russian and British military expeditions to the region that came again under the guise of explorers. During the period referred to as ‘The Great Game’, the British and Tsarist empires vied for control of the region, beginning the process of establishing the first geopolitical boundaries. Did you know? •	There are more than 900 rivers in Tajikistan that are longer than 10km (6 miles). •	Russian soldiers reported seeing a Yeti in the Pamir Mountains. Like the Loch Ness Monster, the legend of the Tajikistan yeti still persists today. •	There are thought to be as few as 3,500 snow leopards left in the wild – 300 are thought to live in the Tajik Pamirs.   Predominantly Sunni Muslim (80%) with a small Shi'ite Muslim minority (5%). A large Ishmaeli minority exists in the Pamirs. There is also a smaller and shrinking Russian Orthodox minority and a small Jewish community. Lipioshka (bread) should never be laid upside down, and it is normal to remove shoes, but not socks, when entering someone's house. Shorts are rarely seen in Tajikistan and, if worn by females, are likely to provoke unwelcome attention from the local male population. Tajik is the official language, an ancient Persian language similar to the languages of Iran and Afghanistan. In the Pamir Mountains, there are at least five different languages, all related to an even more ancient form of Iranian. Russian is widely used (35% of the population speak Russian fluently), and discrimination against Russian speakers is prohibited by law. English is sometimes spoken by those involved in tourism.","In Dushanbe, temperatures vary between a minimum -13°C (8°F) in December/January to a maximum 33°C (91°F) in July/August. Humidity is generally low. In the mountains, it can reach -45°C (-49°F) when the wind chill factor is taken into consideration, and rise to 20°C (68°F) in summer. In the Pamir Mountains, the climate is semi-arid to polar. Warm clothing should be taken by anyone intending to visit themountains. Those intending to visit the southwest in summer shouldbring light, loose clothing. Tajikistan is bordered by Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan to the north, Afghanistan to the south and China (PR) to the east. 93% of the republic is occupied by mountains, most notably by the sparsely populated Pamir Mountains, which include Mount Garmo (formerly Pik Kommunizma; 7,495m/24,590ft), the highest point of the former Soviet Union. The mountainous terrain means that in winter it is impossible to reach the east or the north of the country by road without taking a detour through Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan. In the fertile plains of the southwest, cotton dominates the agriculture. In the north, in the Khudzand (formerly Leninabad) region, cotton and silk are the main crops."
asia,thailand,"The attractions of Thailand are myriad – ruined cities, ancient monasteries, Buddhist monks, colourful hill tribes, floating markets, rave parties, dense rainforests, exotic wildlife, tropical islands, golden beaches and pristine coral reefs. Then there’s Bangkok, the most exuberant capital city in Southeast Asia, which would justify a trip to Thailand all by itself. The Thai people are famously hospitable, and Thailand was one of the first corners of Southeast Asia to really open up to outsiders – helped by the 19th-century king of Siam Rama IV and his love of all things Western. It was Rama IV who launched Thailand on the path to modernisation, and also persuaded his people to swap chopsticks for knives and forks. This travel smorgasbord has attracted everyone from backpackers to billionaires, and visitors can find any level of comfort they desire, from hippy hostels to five-star palaces. If anything, Thailand has become more upmarket as a destination since its backpacker heyday, with air-conditioning everywhere and almost every hotel offering Thai massages and spa treatments. As well as relaxation – and what could be more relaxing than a massage on the beach? – Thailand is a place for adventure. The beaches and islands of the south call out to scuba divers, rock-climbers and water sports enthusiasts, while the dense jungles of the north are a natural playground for trekkers and wildlife spotters. Try bathing under a waterfall in an orchid-filled jungle clearing – you won't forget it. Then there’s the cuisine – one of the world’s finest, and certainly one of the spiciest. From fine restaurants to street stalls and night markets, Thailand always seems to have a fork in its hand. Above all else, though, Thailand is a place to feel at ease – stroll along the sand, take tea with a monk, snorkel over a coral reef, and let the stresses of modern life slowly slip away. 513,120 sq km (198,120 sq miles) 68,863,514 (UN estimate 2016) 135 per sq km Bangkok. Constitutional monarchy. HM King Vajiralongkorn = Rama X since December 2016. Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin since 2023.","Thailand’s social history can be traced back to the Neolithic period, but the country we know and love came into effect with the establishment of an alliance between three kingdoms – Lan Na, Sukhothai, and Phayao in the 13th century. The 14th and 15th centuries witnessed the emergence and growth of the Ayutthaya Kingdom, which continued until it fell to the Burmese, initially in 1569, then again in 1760, before finally succumbing in 1767. Thailand’s current Chakri Dynasty began in 1782 when Phraya Chakri ascended the throne as King Ramathibodi, Rama I. The new dynasty moved the country’s capital city to Bangkok where it remains to this day. King Mongkut, Rama IV, instigated trade and diplomatic relations with European countries in the mid-19th century, as well as educational reforms. During the reign of King Prajadhipok, Rama VII, Thailand changed from an absolute to a constitutional monarchy following a coup d’état in 1932. The country’s name was officially changed in 1939 from Siam to Prathet Thai, or Thailand, meaning ‘land of the free’, a phrase used to express pride in the fact that Thailand is the only Southeast Asian country never to be colonised by a European state. The Thai military government sided with the Japanese in WWII and allowed US forces to use Thai territory during the Vietnam War. Democracy developed slowly in Thailand and after a quarter of a century of military rule, civilian government was restored in 1973 following the student riots in Bangkok, but this was to last only three years before the military again took control. The country continues to move between civilian and military administration – the latest coup in May 2014 resulted in new elections with an end to martial law declared on 1 April 2015, prompting one commentator to note that in the 83 years since absolute monarchy ended in 1932, uniformed or ex-military men have led the nation for 55 years. King Bhumibol Adulyadej, Rama IX was one of the world’s longest serving head of state and Thailand’s longest reigning monarch, having ascended the throne in 1946. After his death in October 2016, his son Maha Vajiralongkorn Bodindradebayavarangkun (known as Vajiralongkorn) has taken to the throne, although he has not yet been crowned formally. Did you know? •	Thailand colluded with the Japanese in the construction of the infamous Burma-Siam railway, made legend by the film The Bridge on the River Kwai. •	Although the elephant is Thailand’s national symbol, its numbers have dropped from 100,000 in 1850 to around 2,700 domesticated elephants today, and 2,000-3,000 in the wild. •	In Thailand, it is illegal to leave home without wearing underwear. The vast majority adhere to Buddhism (Theravada form), 5% are Muslim and there are Christian and Hindu minorities. Western visitors will generally receive a handshake on meeting. A Thai will be greeted with the traditional closed hands and a slight bow of the head - the wai. Buddhist monks are always greeted in this way. The Thai Royal Family is regarded with an almost religious reverence. Visitors should respect this. It is very bad manners to make public displays of anger, as Thais regard such behaviour as boorish and a loss of 'face'. Public displays of affection between men and women are also frowned upon, and it is considered rude to touch anyone on the head, point one's feet at someone, show the bottom of one’s feet to someone or step over a sitting or sleeping person. It's also impolite to point one's toes towards a Buddha statue. Shoes should be removed before entering someone's home or a temple. Smoking restrictions have been in place since 2002 and it is illegal to smoke in public establishments such as bars, restaurants, indoor workplaces, public transport and markets. As of February 2018, there is a smoking ban in non-smoking areas such as vehicles, workplaces and public places. Smoking was already banned across 24 beaches including Koh Samui. According to the Public Health ministry, non-smoking areas include, but are not limited to rental buildings, condos, pubs, hotels, karaoke establishments, religious buildings, restaurants, parking areas, spas, clinics, hospitals, schools, swimming pools, areas for Thai massages, fitness parks and ‘other places’. If caught smoking, the fine will be 5,000 baht. Travellers should keep an eye out for “no smoking” signs to avoid any mistakes. Thai is the official language. English is widely spoken, especially in establishments catering for tourists.","Thailand has a tropical climate so it is generally very hot, particularly between March and May with April being the hottest month (30°C/86°F). The monsoon season runs from May/June to October, when the climate is still hot and humid with torrential rains. Rain in the south typically continues until December. The best time for travelling is November to March as the monsoon season is over and the hot temperatures of Thailand’s summer are yet to arrive. The southern islands like Koh Samui are best from June to September where temperatures average around 27/28°C (81/82°F). Lightweights and rainwear are advised. Informal dress is widely acceptable. Beachwear should be confined to the beach and topless sunbathing is frowned upon. Thailand is quite modest so short or revealing clothes in major cities should be avoided if the goal is to be respectful to the locals. Anything knee-length or longer is acceptable as well as shirts, polos and blouses. Take a pair of good walking shoes or boots for jungle trekking, and long-sleeved tops to protect against mosquitoes. Thailand is bordered to the west by Myanmar and the Indian Ocean, to the south and east by Malaysia and the Gulf of Thailand, to the east by Cambodia, and to the north and east by Laos. The Thai highlands dominate the north of Thailand and Isan in the northeast consists of the Khorat Plateau. The Chao Phraya River dominates central Thailand. Southern Thailand is part of the Malay Peninsula."
asia,china,"Hidden high on the roof of the world, Tibet is a land of golden monasteries, spectacular mountain scenery and a deep spiritual heritage that lives as much in our imagination as it does in the remote Himalayas. Of course, it’s hard to ignore the complex political situation, with Tibet seen both as occupied territory and an integral part of China for the best part of a century depending on who you talk to. This contentious situation can affect your freedom of movement in the country, and so it’s wise to plan your itinerary and do your research well in advance. Once you’ve crossed these barriers, however, an enthralling, unique realm awaits. Many travellers will be drawn to Tibet by the spectacular Buddhist temples, ageless monasteries perched on cliff edges and robed monks chanting peacefully. With the amount of reverence and faith among Tibetans, Tibet truly feels like one of the most spiritual places on Earth. Beyond the zen vibes, Tibet’s nature is also life-affirming. Stunning high-altitude scenery and huge blue salt lakes borne on high towards the heavens are the highlights, while epic journeys beckon. Try the world's highest railway trip, for example, or take the classic overland drive across the Himalayas to Kathmandu in Nepal. A recurring highlight wherever you go is the Tibetan people, always quick with a smile, from visiting bands of pilgrims to nomads in their yak-hair tents. Be sure to try beer in a Lhasa teahouse, or to accept a monk’s offer of yak-butter tea. The Tibetans’ openness and warmth in the face of political oppression is remarkable. Once the very definition of remote, arduous and forbidden travel, Tibet is now surprisingly well connected by road, plane and even rail links. Massive change is reshaping the politically troubled plateau but complicated travel restrictions make independent travel tricky, so do plan ahead. 1,228,400 sq km (474,288 sq miles). 3.3 million (2016). 2.7 per sq km. People's Republic of China comprises 23 provinces (China considers Taiwan its 23rd province), five autonomous regions, two special administrative regions and four municipalities directly under central government.","The early Tibetan Empire was one of Asia's largest, even seizing the Chinese capital Xian in CE 763, before the arrival of Buddhism in the 8th and 9th centuries reshaped the nation's psyche, transforming it into one of the world's most spiritually advanced centres. Up until the 20th century Tibet was essentially a medieval theocracy under the leadership of the reincarnated Dalai Lamas, where wealth, education and political power were vested in the hands of powerful monasteries. During much of the 19th and early-20th centuries, Tibet cut itself off, retreating behind its Himalayan ramparts and closing the doors to foreign travellers, which was a policy that only added to its mystique. The Communist Chinese invasion of Tibet in 1950, shattered this isolation, ushering in four decades of political upheaval. The litany of sorrows included the flight of the Dalai Lama in 1959, the destruction of thousands of monasteries and the detention of countless political prisoners, many of them monks and nuns. Since the late 1980s many religious freedoms have returned although violent demonstrations rocked the region in 1987, 1989 and 2008 and the Chinese occupation of Tibet continues to be a contentious issue. Today the economy is booming with more than two million tourists a year, most of them Chinese. The communist leadership points to huge investment in infrastructure, airports and the controversial railway line as proof of its commitment, but frustrated Tibetans lament the country’s mass immigration, limited employment and state interference in religious affairs. Did you know? •	Butter tea, or po cha, is made from tealeaves, yak butter, water and salt. •	The Tibetan dzo is a hybrid of yak and domestic cattle, larger and stronger than both and more productive in milk and meat. •	Nangma dance music is popular in karaoke bars in Lhasa. Almost all Tibetans are Tibetan Buddhists, a form of Tantric Mahayana Buddhism called Vajrayana. Popular Tibetan folk religion is heavily influenced by the pre-Buddhist Bon religion, a shamanic belief system in spirits, spells and exorcism. Tibetans are generally very easy to get along with. Always walk clockwise around a stupa, religious statue or a mani wall (wall made from stones engraved with religious mantras) and spin prayer wheels clockwise. Don't smoke or talk loudly in a monastery. Don't attend sky burials if uninvited and even then never take photographs. Tibetans will often present an honoured guest or visitor with a white silk scarf known as a kathak. Avoid discussing politics with your guide or monks as you can never be sure who is listening or watching. Don't take photographs of bridges, military installations or the army and avoid getting caught up in political disturbances. The official language of China is Mandarin Chinese, though most Tibetans speak Tibetan as a first language. Most Chinese immigrants (and taxi drivers) don't speak English or Tibetan. English is not widely spoken.","High altitude and strong sun mean that Tibet generally has warm days and cool nights. That said temperatures can fluctuate dramatically and you should bring warm clothing even in summer. Despite being called the 'Land of Snows,' there's actually not that much snowfall, even in winter! Rainfall is minimal and occurs mostly in July and August. The best time to visit Tibet is between April and October. High season is considered to be July, August and the weeks following the national holidays of May 1 and October 1. The shoulder season months of April and May are good times to visit if you want to avoid the crowds. The best months for trekking are July, August and September. Winter is very cold and accommodation and eating options are limited but if you are well equipped, it can be a spectacular time to visit Tibet."
asia,turkmenistan,"It’s an accomplished geographer who can confidently point to Turkmenistan on a map. Despite being similar in size to Spain, this Central Asian nation remains well under most people’s radar. There are two reasons for this. One is that Turkmenistan is a country comprised largely of barren desert and untamed terrain – hardly a big draw for tourists. But the main reason for its obscurity can be traced to Turkmenistan’s autocratic government, which has been compared to the regime of North Korea. At the helm of this ex-Soviet state is President Berdymukhamedov, who promotes a Kim Jong-un style personality cult in which he and his inner circle enjoy absolute power over every aspect of life. Consequently, according to Human Rights Watch, Turkmenistan is one of the most repressed countries in the world, a place where ""human rights defenders and other activists face the constant threat of government reprisals.” If you’re not put off by repressive regimes, Turkmenistan is a destination that offers one thing most others don’t: the chance to travel across the country without seeing other travellers. The isolation is palpable. The brave few who do make it here usually arrive via the capital, Ashgabat. This modern city was built in 1948 after an earthquake destroyed the previous incarnation. Visitors can learn more about this devastating event at the touching Earthquake Museum, one of the city’s finer attractions. Many of Ashgabat’s other landmarks take on a Soviet flavour – Independence Square, the Arch of Neutrality, numerous Lenin statues – but there are also mosques, galleries and gardens. The Altyn Asyr bazaar is worth a visit too, especially if you’re in the market for a Turkmen carpet. Outside the capital, almost all of the country’s attractions lie around the fringes of the desert. Some of the world’s most powerful empires settled here and their crumbling legacies can be seen at the Parthian Fortress of Nisa, Kunya-Urgench and Merv, which are all UNESCO-listed World Heritage Sites. And quiet ones at that. 488,100 sq km (188,456 sq miles). 5,438,670 (UN estimate 2016). 10.7 per sq km. Ashgabat. Republic. President Serdar Berdymukhammedov since 2022. President Serdar Berdymukhammedov since 2022.","The territory of what is now Turkmenistan provided the bedrock for many of the most powerful empires of their age. The Parthians, the Seljuks and the Khans of Khoresm all based their empires at various points on the edge of the Karakum Desert, while Alexander the Great conquered the region during his epic campaign of the 4th century BC. The influence of Islam dates from the 7th century AD, when the region was under Arab control. Modern-day Turkmen are descended from tribes that migrated to the area from the northeast in the 10th century. Around 300 years later, Genghis Khan arrived from the same direction and incorporated Turkmenistan into his expanding empire. From the 15th century, the area was under Persian domination until the Russian move into Central Asia at the end of the 19th century. Turkmenistan fell into the British sphere of influence until the Bolsheviks took control of the region in 1920 and incorporated Turkmenistan as a Soviet republic in 1925. Hampered by its backward economy, the country struggled to embrace the reforms made possible by Glasnost and, despite gaining independence in 1991, still retains many more of the trappings of the old system than other post-Soviet republics. Elected as sole candidate, its first President, Saparmyrat Niyazov ruled until his death in 2006 having been declared president for life by a Mejlis (parliament) made up of elected representatives he had hand-picked. His successor Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedow repealed some of Niyazov’s more eccentric laws, such as banning opera and circus, and established links with western powers hungry for Turkmenistan’s vast reserves of natural gas. A semblance of two-party politics has been introduced, but in practice the opposition Party of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs, established in 2012, operates only under the sanction of the dominant Democratic Party of Turkmenistan, the former Communist Party. Turkmenistan maintains a position of permanent neutrality in all international relations, a stance the United Nations has formally acknowledged since 1995. Did you know? •	More than 80% of Turkmenistan is covered by the Karakum Desert. •	The site of the ancient city of Merv, a major oasis-city on the Silk Road between West and East, has been listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. •	In 1997, ‘President-for-Life’ Saparmyrat Niyazov presented the country with a new national anthem he had composed and written the words for – it’s called ‘Independent, Neutral, Turkmenistan State Anthem’. Catchy. Predominantly Sunni Muslim with a small Russian Orthodox minority. Turkmenistan shares the Central Asian Sufi tradition. Lipioshka (bread) should never be laid upside down, and it is normal to remove shoes, but not socks, when entering someone's house. Shorts are rarely seen in Turkmenistan and, if worn by females, are likely to provoke unwelcome attention from the local male population. Turkmen is the official state language, and is closer to Turkish, Azeri and Crimean Tartar than those of its neighbours Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan. The Turkmen script was changed from Latin to Cyrillic in 1940, but the process of changing back to the Turkish version of the Latin script is underway.","Turkmenistan has an extreme continental climate: temperatures in Ashgabat vary between 46°C (114°F) in summer and -5°C (23°F) in winter, although it has been known to reach -22°C (-8°F) in extremity. Temperatures in the desert in summer can reach 50°C (122°F) during the day before falling rapidly at night. During the winter, it can reach -10° to -15°C (14° to 15°F). For those intending to visit the desert in summer, lightweights arevital for the day with warmer clothing for those intending to spend thenight in the open. Heavyweights should be taken for winter visits. Turkmenistan shares borders with Kazakhstan to the north, Uzbekistan to the east, Afghanistan to the southeast and Iran to the south. To the west is the Caspian Sea. Nearly 80% of the country is taken up by the Kara-Kum (Black Sand) Desert, the largest in the CIS. The longest irrigation canal in the world stretches 1,100km (687 miles), from the Amu-Darya River in the east, through Ashgabat, before being piped the rest of the way to the Caspian Sea."
asia,uzbekistan,"Most people would struggle to find Uzbekistan on a map, let alone get around to visiting. But while this Central Asian nation remains a mystery to the masses, its obscurity makes it all the more appealing for more adventurous travellers. Those who do make the trip are following in famous footprints: from Alexander the Great to Genghis Khan, some of the world’s most famous pioneers and conquerors have blazed a trail through this land. Granted, Uzbekistan has its fair share of problems. It would be remiss not to mention the hard-line government, corrupt officials and Islamic militants that besmirch the reputation of the country. But they are the exception rather than the rule: most people in Uzbekistan extend legendary hospitality to visitors. While the country is young, having gained independence in 1991 after the break-up of the Soviet Union, the roots of Uzbekistan are ancient. The historic town of Samarkand, once a crossroads on the Silk Road, has long been known as the ‘Jewel of Islam’. One of the so-called Big Three (a term used to describe Uzbekistan’s three main Silk Road cities) its cityscape is dominated by sparkling turquoise domes and towering minarets adorned with intricate mosaics. Stunning examples of this architecture can be found across Uzbekistan, most notably in Khiva, the best-preserved and most remote of the Big Three. It’s a living museum, home as it is to a vast collection of Islamic architecture, which remains frozen in time within the city walls. And then there’s Bukhara. The last one of the Big Three, it is also known as the ‘Pillar of Religion’ and is surely one of the most exquisite cities in the Islamic world. It’s not all about manmade attractions, though. The Ferghana Valley is a place of unremitting natural beauty where fertile valleys give out to the snow-capped Tien Shan and Pamir mountains. This also happens to be the country's most fertile region, its breadbasket, where visitors can enjoy stunning landscapes, local produce and friendly bazaars rarely seen by Western eyes. 447,400 sq km (172,742 sq miles). 30,300,446 (UN estimate 2016). 65.3 per sq km. Tashkent. Republic. President Shavkat Mirziyoyev since 2016. Prime Minister Abdulla Nigmatovich Aripov since 2016.","The territory of modern-day Uzbekistan and its close neighbours have seen many empires rise and fall. The Sogdians, the Macedonians, the Huns, the Mongolians, the Seljuks, the Timurids and the Khanates of Samarkand, Bukhara Khiva and Khorezm all held sway at one time or another. Central Asia really came of age with the development of the Silk Road from China to the West, the most valuable trading route of its day. The riches that it brought were used to build fabulous mosques and madrassars (Islamic colleges), most of which were destroyed by the Mongol hordes in the 13th century. Much of the damage was repaired and under Timur the Lame, many new cities were built in the 14th century. Timur conquered all before him and, at its height, his empire stretched to Moscow and Baghdad and as far west as Ankara in Turkey. After his death, the empire crumbled and Central Asia was split into warring Khanates. The Russians had long had their eyes on the lands over their southern border, ever since Peter the Great sent his first military mission to Khiva in 1717, but it was to be another 150 years before they started to make any real headway. In 1865, Russian General Konstantin Kaufmann took Tashkent and signed agreements with the Khans. However, following the Russian Revolution, the Bolsheviks were resisted in Central Asia by bands known as Basmachi until the 1930s when they were finally suppressed and Moscow took control. The history of Central Asia under Soviet rule is one of exploitation. Uzbekistan was turned into a cotton monoculture and most of the product was processed north of the Urals, in Russia and Ukraine. Intensive cotton cultivation in Uzbekistan has in fact been linked to the drying out of the Aral Sea, one of the biggest ecological disasters in Central Asia. Did you know? •	Muslims constitute some 90% of Uzbekistan's population.  •	Uzbekistan has the largest armed forces in Central Asia, with some 68,000 servicemen. •	Around a third of the country's population is aged under 14. Predominantly Sunni Muslim, with Shia (15%), Russian Orthodox and a remaining but tiny, Jewish minority (in Bukhara). Uzbekistan is a Muslim country, albeit a fairly liberal one where women often wear jeans and skirts in the cities. However, for visitors it’s best to cover up out of respect to the local culture and to avoid unwanted attention in all areas, but especially in the conservative Ferghana Valley. Minorities include Tajiks, Kazakhs, Tatars, and Karakalpaks who all contribute to the host culture with their own Central Asian customs. In general, lipioshka (bread) should never be laid upside down and should never be put on the ground, even if it is in a bag. It is normal to remove shoes but not socks when entering someone's house or sitting down in a chai-khana. Hospitality is genuine in Uzbekistan and many follow the saying: ""The visitor is dearer than your father."" While crime is rare, it’s wise to avoid ostentatious displays of wealth (eg jewellery) in public places. Homosexuality is illegal. Photography: Photography near airports, military barracks and police stations can upset the authorities. Most people in Central Asia react well to requests for photographs, but be respectful, always ask and be aware that some older people might not be so forthcoming. The official language is Uzbek, a Turkic tongue closely related to Kazakh and Kyrgyz. There is a small Russian-speaking minority. Many people involved with tourism speak English. The government has stated its intention to change the Cyrillic script to the Latin.","Uzbekistan has an extreme continental climate. It is generally warmest in the south and coldest in the north. Temperatures in December average -8°C (18°F) in the north and 0°C (32°F) in the south. However, extreme fluctuations can take temperatures as low as -35°C (-31°F). During the summer months, temperatures can climb to 45°C (113°F) and above. Humidity is low. In recent years Uzbekistan has been notably affected by general global warming and the specific effects of the drying-out of the Aral Sea. This has turned snowy cold winters to mild ones with less precipitation. The best time to visit is during the spring and autumn, with September being the absolute optimum month. In the winter it can be bitterly cold so bring layers - mountain-wear works well. In the summer, it gets very hot so loose, breathable cottons are best. Covering approximately 448,000 sq km (173,000 square miles), Uzbekistan (literally ‘land of the Uzbeks’) is one of the larger countries in Central Asia (Kazakhstan is by far the largest) and the only one sharing borders with four other Central Asian states. Mountainous Kyrgyzstan lies to the northeast, Tajikistan to the south, Turkmenistan to the southwest, and Kazakhstan to the north with which it shares a suitably long border at 2,203km (1,370 miles). There is also a very short 137km (85 miles) border with war-torn Afghanistan. To the north, and in the central part of the country, lies one of the largest deserts in the world – Kyzyl Kum (meaning ‘red sand’ in Turkic), where the odd camel grazes and where gold is mined in the centre. Elsewhere, the terrain of Uzbekistan is mostly flat. Desert dunes cover the country and some river valleys flow along the courses of the Amu Darya, Syr Darya (Sirdaryo), and Zarafshon rivers. Steppe land and desert plains account for two-thirds of the land mass, with the remainder of the land rising into the foothills of the Tien Shan mountain range. The peaks along the border of Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan reach to over 4,000m (13,000ft). While less than 10% of the land is arable, there are plenty of minerals, containing stocks of natural gas, lignite and coal, gold (it is the world’s ninth largest producer) and copper."
asia,vietnam,"Some destinations evoke mental images the moment their names are mentioned, and Vietnam is one of them. A frenetic and fascinating country, it calls to mind conical-hatted street vendors, water buffalo plodding across rice fields, mopeds buzzing through cities and floating markets on the Mekong River. The days when Vietnam was best known for its conflict with America are long gone. From the temples of Hanoi and the islands of Halong Bay to the beaches of Nha Trang and the palaces of Hue, it is a country now firmly etched in the travel psyche. At times, Vietnam is an assault on the senses. Life in its feverish cities is conducted largely on the streets, among chattering bia hois (pavement pubs) and steaming pho (noodle soup) stands. The country’s two main cities – Hanoi in the north, Ho Chi Minh in the south – are different in many ways, but they share an intoxicating energy. Ancient pagodas and colonial houses jostle for space with new-build skyscrapers, while labyrinthine back-alleys hum with life. These narrow streets are atmospheric places to spend time, day or night. The country’s long, thin shape, sometimes compared to two rice baskets at either end of a pole, means these two cities form natural start and end points to an itinerary. The highlights along the way, meanwhile, are as well packed as the spring rolls which adorn market stalls: nature-lovers, history buffs, beach bums and foodies are all catered for in singularly Vietnamese style. Those heading into the countryside can expect not only glorious scenery, but a rich cultural web of different ethnic groups. The US wartime legacy can still be readily explored – perhaps most notably at the Cu Chi Tunnels near Ho Chi Minh – but this is a country to enjoy for what it is today, whether you’re here for a few days or a month. 331,230 sq km (127,889 sq miles). 94,569,072 (UN estimate 2016). 276 per sq km. Hanoi. Socialist republic. President Tô Lâm since 2024. Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh since 2021.","Under its current boundaries Vietnam has only existed since the 19th century, although the nation’s history stretches back thousands of years, incorporating various powerful kingdoms and a long period of Chinese occupation. In modern times, for many years Vietnam formed part of the French colony of Indochina, along with Cambodia and Laos. In 1941, the Japanese occupied Vietnam during their WWII sweep through Southeast Asia. The resistance to the Japanese was led by the Indochinese Communist Party. Communist revolutionary Ho Chi Minh established the Viet Minh during WWII in order to gain independence from France. Fighting continued until 1954 when the French surrendered to the Viet Minh at Dien Bien Phu and Hanoi became capital of North Vietnam, but Ho Chi Minh was determined to reunite the whole country. The USA came to the support of South Vietnam and full-scale war – with the southern communist guerrillas (known as the Viet Cong), the North Vietnam Army and the Soviet Union on one side, and the Americans and the South Vietnamese Army on the other – broke out in 1965. The weary Americans withdrew in 1973 and fighting continued until 1975 when Saigon fell to North Vietnamese troops. Vietnam was reunited under communist rule the following year. Vietnamese troops occupied Cambodia in 1978 to drive out the genocidal Khmer Rouge regime and stayed there until it withdrew its troops in 1989. After withdrawing from Cambodia, Vietnam concentrated on rebuilding its own economy and, following years of rampant inflation, poverty and repression, the government introduced economic reform or doimoi in 1986, allowing people to own their own businesses. Nonetheless, the Vietnamese economy suffered from the withdrawal of aid and subsidised goods from the former USSR and from Eastern Europe, as well as the continuing US-organised trade boycott instituted after the US withdrawal. Relations with the USA eased after full diplomatic relations were restored in 1995. Recent reforms resulted in rapid economic growth, until the global crisis in 2008, but there has been no parallel development in the country's political environment – the Communist Party has no intention of relaxing its hold on political power and has been criticised by human rights groups for increasingly suppressing online dissent and freedom of expression. The country is involved in ongoing territorial disputes with its old foe China over the sovereignty over the South China Sea. Did you know? •	It’s estimated that Hanoi’s seven million residents collectively own four million scooters. •	The 19th century diplomat Phan Thanh Gian went on hunger strike to protest against French incursions. He was still alive after 15 days, so swallowed poison instead. •	Ho Chi Minh once made a living as a pastry chef on the Newhaven-Dieppe ferry. Buddhist majority. There are also Taoist, Confucian, Hoa Hao, Caodaist and Christian (predominantly Roman Catholic) minorities. Handshaking and a vocal greeting is normal. Clothing should be kept simple, informal and discreet. Avoid shorts if possible as they are usually only worn by children. Footwear should be removed when entering Buddhist pagodas. Vietnamese people should not be touched on the head. It is also polite to give and receive gifts and business cards using two hands. Photography: There are restrictions at ports, airports and harbours, and in similar areas elsewhere. It is courteous to ask permission first before taking photographs of people. Vietnamese is the official language.","Because of its geography, the climate in Vietnam varies greatly from north to south with three distinct climatic zones. Tropical monsoons occur from October to April in the centre and from May to September in the north and south. It is almost totally dry throughout the rest of the year. It can get exceptionally hot, however, all year round, but the north has a cooler time between October and April. Temperatures around the country can reach up to 40C in the height of the hot and rainy season (May to September), but the northern highlands and Hanoi can often seem chilly and damp in the winter. There is no one ideal time to visit Vietnam as a whole but at any time of year there will be sun somewhere. The high season is from September to March but bad weather can disrupt travel in the centre of the country during this period, particularly from September to December. For the beaches in the centre of Vietnam, Danang, Hoi An and Nha Trang, it is best to go between May and August. The autumn is the best time to visit Halong Bay when there should be clear skies. Loose, natural fabrics all year, but warmer clothing is required in the highlands, and in the winter in north Vietnam. Rainwear is essential during the wet season. Vietnam lies within the tropics and is principally agricultural with a central tropical rainforest. The 'S'-shaped country shares borders to the north with the People's Republic of China and to the west with Laos and Cambodia. The eastern and southern shores are lapped by the South China Sea and the Pacific Ocean. Northern Vietnam is dominated by the Red River plains that bisect Hanoi, and the Lo and Chay rivers. To the north and west of Hanoi are green hilly areas; particularly well known is the Sapa Valley. East of Hanoi, Halong Bay features a stunning natural formation of more than 3,000 limestone islands jutting sharply out of the South China Sea. To the south, it is the Mekong River and its fertile plain that governs the geography and consequently the rice industry. Among the plains, in the middle of the thin country and to the southwest are mountainous areas, known as the highlands, where farmers grow rubber, tea and coffee."
caribbean,anguilla,"Beyoncé. Paul McCartney. Denzel Washington. Expect to keep good company if you’re holidaying in Anguilla, which has become something of a hangout for the rich and famous in recent years. Though not the most accessible Caribbean island (geographically and financially speaking), that is precisely why this British Overseas Territory is so appealing for the jet set. There are other reasons, of course. Anguilla also lays claim to some of the finest beaches in the region, as well as some of the most luxurious hotels. Suffice to say, it’s not the place to be penny pinching. That said, some visitors do just that: favourable tax rates have earned Anguilla a reputation as a place to squirrel away the dollars. However, the island’s true riches lie below the waves, where you will find spectacular coral reef formations and a staggering diversity of marine life: from stingrays to sharks, turtles to tropical fish, there’s as much to see on the seafloor as there is on the shore. Sailing is another popular pastime in Anguilla and it doesn’t take long to navigate the tiny island and its eight largely uninhabited cays. If it sounds like a playground for the rich that’s because it is, but that’s not to say more wallet-friendly options don’t exist. There are a range of holiday villas and midrange hotels to suit more modest budgets. A night out needn’t cost the Earth either: potent cocktails go for reasonable prices in Anguilla’s ubiquitous beach bars. Those who like their food are in for an unexpected treat. The restaurant scene is excellent and there is a surprising range of cuisine, from fine French fare to local dishes. Don’t leave without feasting on buttery Anguillan lobster. For the culturally minded, Anguilla has many galleries showcasing local art, not to mention a delightfully eccentric museum. Wherever you are though, those beautiful beaches are only minutes away. 91 sq km (35 sq miles). 14,764 (UN estimate 2016). 164 per sq km. The Valley. British Overseas Territory. HM King Charles III since 2022, represented locally by Governor Julia Crouch since 2023. Chief Minister Ellis Webster since 2020.","Having first been settled by South American tribes at least 3000 years ago and possibly spotted by Columbus in 1493, Anguilla was named the Spanish (the word means ‘eel’) because of the island’s shape, but it was the British who first colonised the land in the 17th century when the island was administered in conjunction with the Leeward Islands. It seems the colonists brought African slaves with them and the island drew the attentions of the French whose efforts to capture it in 1745 and 1796 were repelled. During the middle of 20th century, Anguilla was incorporated into St Kitts and Nevis, despite opposition from the islanders. Upon St Kitts’ independence in 1967, the Anguillians refused to accept independent government from there. It led to two ‘revolutions’ precipitated by referenda in 1967 and 1969 in which the population voted overwhelming against government by St Kitts. After declaring themselves the Republic of Anguilla, a junior minister from the British government arrived to establish an interim government but was quickly expelled. Days later 315 British paratroopers, 40 Metropolitan police officers and two frigates followed, order was duly restored and a new Commissioner installed. A new constitution was enacted in 1976 and in 1980 Anguilla was formally separated from St Kitts and Nevis and granted the status of a British overseas territory. Domestic politics have been dominated by the shifting fortunes of the Anguilla United Movement, the Anguilla United Front (which comprises the Anguilla National Alliance and the Anguilla Democratic Party) and the Anguilla Progressive Party, as well as various independent politicians. The current Chief Minister, Victor Banks, took office in 2015.   There are seven elected seats in Anguilla’s assembly – four assembly members are appointed, three by the governor and one by the ruling party. The assembly is part of the executive council, led by the chief minister who advises the governor, who is appointed by the British monarch, according to the 1982 constitution. With no tax on profits, estate or capital gains Anguilla has been a popular tax haven for years. In 2011, faced with mounting debts of its own, it introduced its first form of income tax – the Interim Stabilisation Levy – at three per cent. Did you know? • The national sport is boat racing and there are regattas on pubic holidays. • It is thought the island’s population of Green Iguanas descends from creatures brought from overseas and deposited by hurricanes. • Anguilla enjoys the reputation of being the ‘culinary capital of the Caribbean’. Roman Catholic, Anglican, Baptist, Methodist and Moravian, with Hindu, Jewish and Muslim minorities. The government is anxious to set limits to the commercialisation of the island and visitors will find that social life is centred on the tourist areas. Anguillians will greet anyone they meet, whether they know them personally or not, and expect to be acknowledged in return. The atmosphere is relaxed and English customs prevail. Beachwear should be confined to resorts. Topless and nude bathing is prohibited. English is the official and commercial language.","Hot throughout the year, tempered by trade winds in local areas, particularly early in the year. The average rainfall for the year is 89 cm (35in) and the hurricane season is from July to November. Lightweight cottons throughout the year. Waterproofs are advisable for the rainy season. Anguilla, the northernmost of the Leeward Islands, also comprises the island of Sombrero, lying 48km (30 miles) north of Anguilla, and several small islets or cays. The nearest islands are St Maarten, 8km (5 miles) south of Anguilla, and St Kitts and Nevis, 113km (70 miles) to the southeast. The islands are mainly flat (the highest point, Crocus Hill, is only 60m (213ft) above sea level) with, arguably, some of the best beaches in the world."
caribbean,antigua-and-barbuda,"“We have 365 beaches here – one for every day of the year.” If you were given a dollar every time you heard that in Antigua, your holiday would surely be paid for. It’s the national catchphrase and you’ll get tired of hearing it. But locals have every right to be proud of Antigua and its dashing twin, Barbuda: with their powdery beaches and swaying palms they’re the quintessence of Caribbean island idyll. Most of the action takes place in Antigua, a glamorous island where expensive yachts float in the harbour, honeymooners frolic in the surf and scuba divers explore colourful coral reefs in crystalline waters. You can see why Giorgio Armani and Oprah Winfrey keep homes here. Away from the glamour, there are many attractions: from steamy rainforests to historic sites such as Shirley Heights, a military lookout with views over Nelson’s Dockyard, the only working Georgian dockyard in the world. Antigua’s highest point, Mount Obama, begs to be climbed. It’s also worth checking out the island’s national parks and billowing blowholes, such as Devil's Bridge, which are caused by the colliding surf of the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea. The buzzing Saturday market in St Johns, the capital, is a must: pick up anything from fresh fruit to local crafts. Antigua springs to life at night, with dozens of places to party including Shirley Heights, which is the setting for Sunday night “jump ups” (street parties) featuring live music and lots of rum punch. Antigua’s little sister Barbuda is quieter, but no less beautiful. Lying 43.5km (27 miles) to the north, its beating heart is Codrington, which is widely referred to as “The Village”. Codrington consists of only a handful of streets and offers a glimpse of Caribbean life as it used to be. Although small, there is much to do in Barbuda. The island is a haven for wild deer and exotic birds, and is home to the Frigate Bird Sanctuary. Important Amerindian rock carvings can be found at Two foot Bay, while sumptuous beaches abound.

Prime Minister Gaston Browne since 2014.","Originally called Wadadli or Waladli by its Amerindian settlers, Antigua and Barbuda’s earliest inhabitants were the Siboney people from around 3100 BC. The Arawak Indians arrived in the first century, followed by Caribs who settled throughout the Caribbean. Christopher Columbus spotted Antigua on his second voyage to the West Indies in 1493 and without landing named it Santa Maria de la Antigua after a saint. Sir Christopher Codrington, the first settler on Antigua, arrived in 1684 and introduced sugar cultivation to the islands. By the middle of the 18th century there were hundreds of plantations as Antigua became one of Great Britain’s most lucrative colonies, it economy reliant almost exclusively on sugar and, until its eventual abolition in 1834, slavery. Many modern day Antiguans are descended from slaves brought to the island from Africa. In 1860, Barbuda was annexed to the territory of Antigua, with the small island of Redonda becoming part of Antigua 12 years later. Admiral Nelson developed British naval facilities at English Harbour in 1784 and Nelson’s Dockyard survives as the last example of a Georgian naval dockyard. A strategic port and valuable commercial colony, by the end of the 18th century Antigua was known as the ‘Gateway of the Caribbean’. Until the development of tourism during the last century, Antigua’s economy struggled after the demise of the sugar industry. Economic problems contributed to the growth of an independence movement and internal autonomy was achieved in February 1967 when Antigua, Barbuda and Redonda became an Associated State of the Commonwealth. In 1981, the country became fully independent as Antigua and Barbuda with HM The Queen currently head of state. In Parliament, the populist Antigua Labour Party (ALP) dominated party politics until its historic defeat in 2004, which saw the Caribbean’s longest serving elected government toppled. Prime Minster Gaston Browne returned the ALP – now the Antigua and Barbuda Labour Party – to power in the June 2014 elections. Did you know? • The highest point on Antigua is Mount Obama, known as Boggy Peak until 2009 before it was renamed in honour of the US President. • English is the official language although many locals speak Antiguan Creole. The Barbudan accent is slightly different to the Antiguan. • The national sport is cricket with several West Indian superstars hailing from Antigua including Sir Vivian Richards, Andy Roberts and Richie Richardson. The population is predominantly Christian with the majority denomination being Anglican but there are also Methodists, Roman Catholics, Pentecostals, Baptists, Seventh Day Adventists and others. When it comes to greetings, relatives and good friends generally embrace whilst for acquaintances a handshake will do. Salutations such as 'good morning' and 'good evening' are seen as good manners, and failure to greet others in this way before engaging them in transactional matters or general conversation, may result in being seen as rude. Friends tend to drop by unannounced, but an invitation is necessary for acquaintances or business associates. Although gifts will generally be well received, they are normally only given on celebratory occasions. Flowers are appropriate for dinner parties; bring a bottle only when specifically requested. In general, because of the warm weather, the dress code in most scenarios tends to be for informal dress, unless formal dress is specifically requested. It is not acceptable to wear revealing clothing or beachwear in towns or villages. Keep in mind that Antigua and Barbuda is a highly conservative country – public nudity (such as topless sunbathing outside of your hotel) will cause offence. It is an offence for anyone, including children, to dress in camouflage clothing and those found wearing any military-type clothing will be arrested. Smoking is accepted in most public places. Homosexual acts are illegal. English is the official language but many locals speak a sort of patois. There are some Spanish-speaking communities too.","The islands enjoy a very pleasant balmy tropical climate which remains warm and relatively dry throughout the year, with relatively little variance. Temperatures range from lows of 22°C (72°F) to highs of 40°C (104°F) all year round, with October to January being the hottest time of year, staying in the region of 30°C (86°F) to 35°C (95°F). Cooling winds blow in from the south east so the heat rarely feels too unbearable. In general, humidity in Antigua and Barbuda is quite low, meaning you won't be drenched in a sweaty fug during your trip. The rainy season runs from around June to November, and during this time daily rain showers are common; there is also a good chance of tropical storms and hurricanes across the islands. Their location in the hurricane zone means the islands are vulnerable to powerful storms every two or three years, whilst hurricanes can hit every two to six years. Dress for a tropical climate - lightweight cottons or linens will be appropriate for most of the year, but those visiting the islands from June to September should bring waterproofs so that they're not caught out when the rains come. Antigua & Barbuda is made up of three islands; Antigua, Barbuda and Redonda. Low-lying and volcanic in origin, they are part of the Leeward Islands group in the northeast Caribbean. Antigua's coastline curves into a multitude of coves and harbours (they were once volcanic craters) and there are more than 365 beaches of fine white sand, fringed with palms. The island's highest point, Mount Obama stands at 402m (1,319ft) high, and its capital is St John's. Barbuda lies 61.5km (38.2 miles) north of Antigua and is an unspoiled natural haven for wild deer and exotic birds. Its 8km-long (5 miles) beach is reputed to be among the most beautiful in the world. The island's village capital, Codrington, was named after the Gloucestershire family that once leased Barbuda from the British Crown for the price of 'one fat pig per year if asked for'. There are excellent beaches and the ruins of some of the earliest plantations in the West Indies. The coastal waters are rich with all types of crustaceans and tropical fish. Redonda, the smallest in the group, is little more than an uninhabited rocky islet. It lies 40km (25 miles) southwest of Antigua."
caribbean,aruba,"Lean back and take it easy on Aruba, which combines the best that Caribbean sea, sand and sunshine have to offer. Aruba's balmy breezes and relaxed pace are just the tonic for any frazzled visitor; just like the soothing aloe vera plant that is found everywhere on the island. The surrounding waters are populated by colourful creatures such as parrotfish splashed with teal and gold, while bright pink flamingos populate the national park. Aruba's capital, Oranjestad, also dazzles – it's great for shopping. Orange facades brightly array the architecture, indicating the island's historical ties with The Netherlands – Aruba's head of state is still the Dutch ruling monarch. Favoured by Americans keen to escape extreme weather in winter, Aruba is one of the most popular touristic islands in the southern Caribbean. Sometimes the mob has it right. This island's beautiful beaches, pristine resorts and charming city of Oranjestad are difficult to knock. You'll also find a lively nighttime scene, with glittering casinos, gourmet restaurants and beach-side diners. Many come on day-trips as part of a cruise, but it's really worth spending a bit more time in Aruba, soaking up its nature, all rugged coasts and gorgeous beaches. In the interior you'll find rocky deserts, expanses filled with cactuses and the iconic divi-divi tree. It's a good idea to hire a car to really make the most of it. Many tourists don't stray far from Oranjestad, but a drive to the northern and eastern shores comes highly recommended. Look out for the California Lighthouse and Seroe Colorado. Modern road signs are still being developed here, so try not to get lost. As for history, Aruba's first inhabitants are thought to be Amerindians from the Arawak tribe. The island was later colonised by the Spanish, before being taken over by the Dutch in the 17th century. Today's Arubans are for the most part an interesting mix of Amerindian and European heritage, with the island boasting the strongest Arawak heritage in the region. There is also a considerable black population, as well as more recent Venezuelan immigrants. Altogether this makes for a lively local scene that's both welcoming and distinct. 193 sq km (74.5 sq miles). 104,263 (UN estimate 2016). 573.4 per sq km. Oranjestad.

He described an ‘island of giants’ having been struck by the stature of the population. However, the Spaniards did not consider the island worth colonising and left the original Arawak Indian inhabitants to live in virtual peace. Although Spain’s lack of interest resulted in the island becoming a haven for pirates and buccaneers, the Spanish hegemony continued unchallenged until 1636, by which time the war with Holland was well into its seventh decade. Dutch war interests then switched to the Caribbean and the Dutch fleet took over the neglected territory with little opposition. In 1643, the Dutch appointed a governor to take charge of Aruba and the rest of the Netherlands Antilles. Except for a brief period in the early 19th century, when the British took possession during the Napoleonic Wars, Aruba has remained under peaceful Dutch jurisdiction ever since. During World War 2 Aruba was administered by the Dutch government-in-exile in London and continued to supply oil to Britain and her allies. On 1 January 1986, Aruba achieved internal autonomy, separating it administratively from the rest of the Netherlands Antilles, although it remains a constituent country of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. This was originally conceived as the first step towards independence, for which a 10-year transitional period was planned. In March 1994, however, after consultation with the Dutch government, this plan was shelved. Independence at some later date has not been completely ruled out but it will now require the consent of two-thirds of the population in a referendum. The Dutch king Willem-Alexander is Aruba’s head of state and appoints the island’s governor on a six-year term. The prime minster and deputy prime minister are elected by the Aruban Parlamento, which is made up of 21 members elected by popular vote on four-year terms. In recent years increasing US tourism has been reflected in the growing popularity of American celebrations such as Halloween and Thanksgiving. Did you know? • With low unemployment Aruba enjoys one of the highest standards of living in the Caribbean. • With Bonaire and Curaçao, Aruba forms a group known as the ABC Islands. • The capital Oranjestad, often referred to as Playa, was built around Fort Zoutman in 1796 and was named after King William I in the 1820s. The artificial Renaissance Island is home to a population of flamingos and has Aruba’s only private beaches. 82% of the population are Roman Catholic. There are also Protestant, Hindu, Muslim, Confucian and Jewish communities present. Much of the social activity takes place in hotels where the atmosphere will be informal, often American in feel. The islanders do not wear shorts in town though it is acceptable for visitors to do so. Bathing suits are strictly for beach or poolside. In the evenings people tend to dress up, especially when visiting the casinos. Jackets are not required for men, except for official government functions. The official language is Dutch. English and Spanish are also spoken. The islanders also speak Papiamento, which is a combination of Dutch, Spanish, Portuguese, English and Indian languages.","With an average temperature of 28°C (82°F), this dry and sunny island is made pleasantly cool throughout the year by constant trade winds. Short showers occur during the months of October, November and December. Lightweight clothes. Sweaters are useful for air conditioned hotels and restaurants. Some upscale restaurants do not allow shorts and T-shirts. Aruba is the smallest island in the Leeward group of the Dutch Caribbean islands, which also include Bonaire and Curaçao; they are popularly known as the ABCs. As the westernmost island of the group, Aruba is the final link in the long Antillean chain, lying 20km (12.5 miles) off the Venezuelan coast. The island is 30km (19.6 miles) long and 9km (6 miles) across at its widest, and has a flat landscape dominated by Jamanota Mountain (188m/617ft). The west and southwest coast, known as Palm Beach, boasts 11km (7 miles) of palm-fringed powder-white sands while, in contrast, the east coast has a desolate and windswept shoreline of jagged rocks carved into peculiar shapes by the pounding surf."
caribbean,bahamas,"The quiet coves and crowd-free beaches of the Bahamas offer visitors the intimacy of a secluded retreat within a paradisiacal expanse of some 700 palm-fringed isles. Christened baja mar (meaning 'shallow sea') by Christopher Columbus, these islands, with their astonishing hues of sand and sea spanning the colour spectrum from twinkling turquoise to rose pink, are the personification of paradise. Crystalline waters secrete ancient shipwrecks and a rainbow of coral reefs, while pastel-coloured seashells and vibrant clapboard houses perch atop a tropical landscape that resonates with exotic birdsong. There’s the over-riding feeling that the Bahamas has got tourism just right: a range of resorts cater for holidaymakers, including a growing range of eco-hotels, yet their impact on the islands’ natural beauty remains, by in large, minimal. The full gauntlet of watersports beckon for the active holidaymaker: from scuba diving and snorkelling to parasailing and sailing, there’s more than enough to get the pulse racing here. Then there are the glitzy golf courses, designed by the game’s best, whose vistas are enough to compensate for a bad day on the fairways. Pack your hiking shoes and explore the clutch of nature reserves that are scattered across the archipelago. Pack your binoculars too and look out for the myriad of bird species that call the Bahamas home: from bright pink flamingos to multicolored parrots, you can’t miss some of the more flamboyant species. Come sundown, Bahamian bars and clubs pulsate with island rhythms; discover riotous dance festivals that mix African slave-trade rituals with Bahamian tempo and American hip-hop twists, or head to one of the archipelago’s bustling straw markets to haggle over spices, and ceramics. If it all gets too much, recharge your batteries at one of the wonderful seafood restaurants or with an infamous rum cocktail.

Prime Minister Philip Davis since 2021.","The original inhabitants, the Lucayan Indians, survived through fishing and a developed trading system with Cuba and Haiti, flourishing until 1492 when the Bahamas were first discovered by Europeans under Columbus. San Salvador, near modern-day Cockburn Town, was his first landing place in the New World. Close to key trading routes, settlers arrived in their droves, most notably the Eleutheran Adventurers, a group of English religious dissidents, in 1647. Adventurers they certainly were, braving food shortages and piracy before establishing a more easily defensible settlement on Harbour Island. The era of privateering raged on – the pirate Blackbeard was at one time magistrate of a pirate-controlled Nassau before the archipelago was formally colonised by Britain in 1717, under Woodes Rogers (himself an ex-privateer). The islands were briefly re-occupied by the Spanish in 1782 but returned to Britain the following year. A comparatively peaceful, prosperous era ensued. An early haven for freed slaves, the islands lucratively became a trading post for Confederate cotton in the American Civil War. And during Prohibition the port of Nassau had to expand to cope with the surge in the rum trade. When Cuba closed to tourism in 1962, the Bahamas quickly promoted itself as the bona fide holiday destination for America’s wealthy. Internal self-government arrived two years later, followed by full independence in 1973. The Bahamas is a Commonwealth realm – one of 16 former British colonies that are members of the Commonwealth of Nations – and retains HM The Queen as head of state. The head of the government is the prime minister, currently the Rt Hon Perry Christie, who leads the party with the most seats in the House of Assembly, the lower house, which is augmented by a 16-member Senate appointed by the governor general. Did you know? •	Although illegal, Obeah, a form of folk magic, is practised by some Bahamians mainly in the outlying Family Islands. •	Local heroes, The Baha Men enjoyed a massive worldwide hit in 2000 with Who Let the Dogs Out? •	The uninhabited island of Pig Beach is populated exclusively by feral pigs. Predominantly Christian with Baptist, Anglican and Roman Catholic the main denominations and Methodist, Church of God and other Protestant faiths minority groups. The chilled-out Bahamian pace of life dominates every convention. 'Island time' is a relaxed approach to time-keeping and also describes the Bahamians' laid-back attitude to life. A slow pace prevails across the board from the banks to the Government offices. Dress is casual, although business attire is worn. Holidaymakers will find beachwear is accepted in the resorts but is frowned upon elsewhere. When dining, dancing or high-rolling in the casinos of Nassau or Freeport, dressing up is de rigueur. English is the official language.

Sparkling, clear waters are home to vibrant underwater gardens on the world's third longest barrier reef, which contains about 14.5% of the coral on the planet. Fertile marine plains are split between two oceanic facets, the Little Bahama Bank and the Great Bahama Bank, where visibility of around 60m (197ft) is the norm. Exotic flowers, pine forest, rugged shoreline, barren savannahs, marshlands and sandy beaches typify the landscape, on a bed of limestone and coral rocks."
caribbean,barbados,"Fringed by white sandy beaches, sapphire seas and colourful coral reefs, Barbados is the archetypal Caribbean retreat. Off the beaten path this is not: Simon Cowell, Wayne Rooney and Will Smith are amongst the many celebs that have popularised the island, which, alas, has the a-list prices to match. First time visitors can be forgiven for heading straight for the sand. Barbados is endowed with 113km (70 miles) of glorious beaches, which range from calm coves to surf-pounded shorelines. Most tourists flock to the Platinum Coast to the west, which is lined with luxury resorts, spa hotels, sophisticated restaurants and manicured golf courses, all lapped by the limpid Caribbean Sea. Never played golf? Not a fan of high-end resorts? Then fear not. The altogether quieter south coast has some of the island’s best beaches, while the east coast, pummelled by the Atlantic Ocean, is less developed and attracts mainly surfers, who quench their thirsts in local rum shacks. Although Barbados’s interior is unremarkable compared to some of its Caribbean neighbours there is much to see. And the best way to see it is by hiring a motorbike or a jeep and taking to the road, calling at crumbling sugar mills, rum distilleries and traditional churches that look like they’ve been lifted from England. Finish up in the colonial capital, Bridgetown, which, along with the nearby garrison, was awarded World Heritage Site status in 2012. Combine these attractions with the island’s indelible laid-back vibe, its passion for rum (over 1,500 rum shops dot the island) and calypso-infused festivals, and it’s no wonder people return to Barbados time and time again. 430 sq km (166 sq miles). 284,996 (UN estimate 2016). 663 per sq km. Bridgetown. Republic. President Dame Sandra Mason since 2021.

This war faring tribe was then decimated with the arrival of the Spanish in the 1400s. While the Spanish, and later the Portuguese, christened the island Los Barbodoes (“the bearded ones”, after the island’s fig trees), it was the British who claimed the island in 1625. By 1663, Barbados was declared a British colony and slaves were brought to the island from Africa to work on the sugar plantations, which rapidly underpinned the entire country’s economy. Barbados dominated the industry until 1720. Slavery was then abolished in 1834 but many freed Bajans returned to work as paid labourers for the former employers. During the early 1900s, the establishment of trade unions gave workers more rights, but the Great Depression of the 1930s led to soaring unemployment, riots and British financial aid. Gradually, Bajans started to demand their own political rights, leading to the election of Errol Walton Barrow as the island’s first prime minister in 1962. Barrow led Barbados to independence four years later. Since then successive governments have tried to help diversify the economy and propel development. However, the country’s sugar industry has declined and the agriculture industry has follow suit. Tourism has picked up the slack. Barbados has a highly developed tourism industry, though it did take a knock after the recession in 2008, reminding islanders of the vulnerability of pinning the economy’s hopes on one industry. Meanwhile, the island’s offshore banking and financial services sector has grown. In the 2008 election, David Thompson of the Democratic Labour Party (DLP) assumed office as prime minister from the Barbados Labour Party, which had been in power for 14 years. Thompson pledged to focus on domestic issues, particularly the cost of living, healthcare, and crime. His successor, Freundel Stuart took over in 2010. Did you know? •	Drink driving in Barbados is still not illegal. •	Barbados is known as the “land of the flying fish” due to the ubiquity of these creatures in its waters. •	In Barbados it is considered good luck if a mongoose crosses your path. Over 100 religious groups practise island-wide, from the Anglican majority to smaller Roman Catholic, Jewish, Hindu, Baptists, Pentecostals, Seventh Day Adventists, Jehovah's Witnesses, Mormons, The Salvation Army, Muslim and Quaker faiths. Many British societal attitudes permeate bureaucratic red tape and architecture, yet when it comes to time-keeping, humour and urgency the laid-back Barbados manner reigns supreme. Barefoot casual attire is de rigour except when dressing up-to-the nines for dinner - or church. As a former slave colony, personal freedom is highly valued. The official language is English. Local Bajan dialect is also spoken.","Constant sea breezes cool Barbados's balmy, tropical climate but the island is still sunnier and drier than the other islands. During the so-called wet season (July to November), some brief rain showers are likely. Average sunshine hours per day are eight to 10 from November to March and eight to nine from April to October. Tropical storms and hurricanes may occur between June and November. Lightweight cottons are advised; beachwear is not worn in towns. As the most easterly of the Caribbean chain, Barbados lies well to the east of the West Indies. A lively surf scene enjoys pounding waves along the rugged east coast where a rocky shoreline kicks up plenty of spray. To the west, fine white sand beaches and natural coral reefs predominate. A handful of gently rolling hills form a ripple to the north while the rest of the island is predominantly flat. Coral filters ensure surrounding waters are among the purest on the planet."
caribbean,bermuda,"Bermuda is probably best known for two things: lurid, knee-length shorts and the fabled Bermuda Triangle, a stretch of sea where boats and planes are said to have mysteriously disappeared. However, these lazy stereotypes serve only to distract from what is an exceptionally beautiful destination. Comprised of around 180 islets, Bermuda looks like your archetypal Caribbean retreat with its fine sandy beaches, colourful coral reefs and swaying palms. But it’s nothing of the sort. In fact this lonely archipelago floats 1,030km (640 miles) off the coast of South Carolina, adrift in the Atlantic Ocean, far from anywhere in particular. A British Overseas Territory, Bermuda has embraced many traditions from the motherland: from sophisticated gents playing cricket to refined ladies supping afternoon tea. There are even red phone boxes. Discovered by the Spanish in 1505, Bermuda fell into British hands a century later and has remained part of the much-diminished empire ever since. The legendary writer, Mark Twain, popularised the islands in the late 19th century. “You go to heaven if you want – I’d rather stay here instead,” he cooed. John Lennon was another fan of the archipelago, which was the muse behind his song, Borrowed Time. For some time Bermuda has been considered a destination for the, shall we say, more mature traveller. And while its scenic golf courses, colonial hotels and genteel vibe do suit elderly travellers, the archipelago has started to attract a younger crowd in recent years. They come for the excellent scuba diving, the cycling and other adventure activities, or just to explore the beauty of the archipelago from the back of a motorbike. And beautiful it is. Bermuda’s coastline is blessed with pink sandy beaches and crystalline waters, while inland visitors will find an abundance of subtropical plants and flowers, interspersed with quaint pastel cottages. There are certainly worse places to disappear. 53 sq km (20 sq miles). 65,331 (UN estimate 2016). 1,324.5 per sq km. Hamilton. Parliamentary, self-governing British Overseas Territory.

Shipwrecked Portuguese and other European sailors subsequently left their marks on the land – some kept and released pigs – before the island was claimed in England’s name by Sir George Somers in July 1609. After colonisation, Bermuda prospered and has continued to do so almost continuously ever since. Bermuda is the oldest British colony and there are still elements of British culture and customs in almost every aspect of life on the islands although the tourist industry, which began in Victorian times, caters particularly for the American market. In 1949 when Newfoundland became part of Canada, Bermuda became the oldest remaining British Overseas Territory and since 1997, following the transfer of Hong Kong to China, it has been the most populous. Established in 1612 its first capital, St George’s, is the oldest continuously inhabited English town in the New World. In 1968 the island was granted internal self-government with the UK retaining control of defence and foreign policy. For many years Bermudan political life was dominated by the United Bermuda Party (UBP), which won a string of election victories from 1964 until 1998, when the Progressive Labour Party displaced it. The PLP held sway until December 2012 when the One Bermuda Alliance (OBA) – formed by a merger of the opposition UBP and Bermuda Democratic Alliance – won the general election. Bermuda’s current Premier is the OBA’s Michael Dunkley. The government’s recent agenda has been dominated by three issues: the economy, which relies heavily on financial services and has grown steadily; independence (the most recent plebiscite on the issue took place in August 1995 when a low turnout, produced a vote of 74 per cent against independence and in favour of remaining under British rule); and British citizenship – the British government still has to reach a final decision and it remains the subject of some irritation in the territory.

Almost all hotels and restaurants require a smart casual dress in the evenings; check dress requirements in advance. Non-smoking areas will be marked. Drinking alcohol in public outside of a licensed premise is prohibited. English is the official language. There is also a small Portuguese-speaking population.","Sub-tropical, with no wet season. The Gulf Stream, which flows between Bermuda and the North American continent, keeps the climate temperate. Change of seasons comes during mid November to mid December and from late March through to April, when spring or summer weather may occur and visitors should be prepared for both. Showers may be heavy at times but the skies usually clear quickly. Summer temperatures prevail from May to mid October, with the warmest weather from July to September - this period is occasionally followed by high winds. Visitors should note that such high winds between 1 June and 30 November can (albeit rarely) turn into hurricanes and tropical storms. Since Bermuda is a small target, most storms brush by and only bring elevated surf. Lightweight cottons and linens. Light waterproofs or umbrellas are advisable and warmer clothes for cooler months.

caribbean,bonaire,"Bonaire is the second-largest island in the former Dutch Antilles, and has desert-like terrain offset by inviting turquoise waters. Beneath the water's surface, rainbow-hued fish drift in between coral, and many believe argue that the diving and snorkelling here is the best in the Caribbean; Bonaire's relative lack of tourism means much of its coral has gone undisturbed. For those seeking sailing or windsurfing, the characteristic windswept postures of the divi divi trees show that Bonaire's warm, dry and breezy climate is ideal for these sorts of activities. Bonaire is highly eco-friendly and keen not to impair the fragile infrastructure of the coral, nor unsettle the island's serenity with heavy development and glitzy nightlife. Consequently, Bonaire's beautiful beaches and safe waters have remained intact.

Spanish colonisation, which started in 1526, was a little half-hearted and although they imported domesticated cows, donkeys, goats, horses, pigs and sheep it’s not thought their efforts at farming came to much. From the 1620s the Dutch were regular visitors to the island and abandoned the Spanish and Portuguese prisoners who built the town of Antriol on Bonaire. During the Eighty Years War between Spain and The Netherlands, the Dutch conquered Bonaire and built Fort Oranje in 1639. The Dutch West Indies Company introduced economic development schemes for which they imported hundreds of slave workers. Even after emancipation free slaves were obliged to do at least dome work for the government, but the abolition of slavery heralded in a long period of economic depression that was only accelerated when the government sold most of the public lands in the 1860s and eventually the vast saltpans, leaving the entire population economically dependent on two private landowners. During World War 2 Bonaire became a protectorate of Britain and the United States and by 1945 the US Army had built Flamingo Airport, while many German and Austrian citizens were interned on Bonaire. An indigenous economy began to emerge in the post-war years as the airport was turned over to civilian use and the former internment camp became the island s firs hotel, paving the way for the modern tourism industry. After the dissolution of the Netherlands Antilles in 2010, Bonaire held a referendum on independence, but although 84 per cent of those who voted did so to become part of The Netherlands, because the turn out was well below the 51 per cent required, the result was declared void. Bonaire is now a ‘special municipality' or public body of The Netherlands but in a referendum in December 2015 65 per cent voted they were not content with Bonaire’s current relationship with The Netherlands. Did you know? • With Aruba and Curaçao, Bonaire forms part of a group often referred to as the ABC Islands. • A giant system of ponds and pools has been created in southern Bonaire to facilitate the production of salt by evaporation. The condensing pools are a natural habitat for brine shrimp on which large flocks of flamingoes and other migratory birds feed. • Lac Bay in the south-east of the island is popular with surfers. Predominantly Roman Catholic with a Protestant minority. There are many evangelical churches of different denominations, and a new mosque has also been erected on the island. Dutch customs are still prevalent throughout the islands, although they are increasingly subject to US influence. Dress is casual and lightweight cottons are advised. Bathing suits should be confined to beach and poolside areas only. Nudity is prohibited on beaches except at Sorobon Beach Resort, a privately owned nudist resort. Dutch is the official language. Papiamento (a mixture of Portuguese, African, Spanish, Dutch and English) is the commonly used lingua franca. English and Spanish are also widely spoken.","Hot throughout the year, but tempered by cooling trade winds. The average temperature is 28°C (82°F) and the average rainfall is 50cm (20 inches) per year. Bonaire offers good conditions for diving all year round, althought conditions at the south end are generally at their calmest February-April. Lightweights with warmer top layers for evenings; showerproof clothing is advisable throughout the year. Bonaire is the second-largest island in the former Netherlands Antilles and is located 80km (50 miles) north of Venezuela and 48km (30 miles) east of Curaçao. The landscape is flat and rocky and, owing to low annual rainfall, Bonaire has a fairly barren desert climate. The island has small, beautiful beaches and safe waters."
caribbean,british-virgin-islands,"Sloping hills of green, lush mountainous terrain, extensive coral reefs and famous shipwrecks sum up the thrills and spills of the British Virgin Islands. With myriad nautical pursuits on offer, the 50 idyllic islands are a slice of paradise. Norman Island was supposedly the location that Robert Louis Stevenson based Treasure Island on. Today's visitors might not stumble across swashbuckling pirates or half-concealed treasure troves, but they will find a highly prized booty of soft sand and gentle, teal waters. For travellers who prefer to watch the sea rather than get into it, there is the breathtaking chance of spotting dolphins and whales criss-crossing the surface. Throughout much of their history, the string of islands and cays were sleepy and unnoticed. Today, colossal cruise ships glide to a halt in the shadow of Road Town on Tortola, the largest of the islands. Smaller ships also take in Virgin Gorda, the second biggest island, docking outside the curiously named Spanish Town. Hardly qualifying as a town, the latter has a few shops and a pretty marina, and is quiet, picturesque settlement. Road Town offers a little more action, with a gleaming harbour and waterfront, as well plenty of pastel-coloured West Indian architecture. Sir Olva Georges Square is a pleasant spot to take a seat and admire the views. Although the tourism industry is booming here, you can easily get away from it all. Much of the accommodation beyond Road Town offers utter tranquility, while some of the hotels elsewhere in the territory pretty much have islands to themselves. Paradise does come at a cost. Overall, the British Virgin Islands are quite an expensive destination. But, for some, this is the necessary price of saving a Caribbean gem from over-commercialisation. And if that's the intention, the British Virgin Islands are, for now, a resounding success. 153 sq km (59 sq miles). 30,659 (UN estimate 2016). 218.7 per sq km. Road Town, Tortola.

Acting Premier Natalio Wheatley since 2022.","Although there is evidence of habitation dating back to 1500 BC, the Islands were first settled by South American Arawaks around 100 BC before being supplanted by the Caribs in the 15th century. Sighted by Columbus on his second voyage to the New World in 1493 he named them ‘Santa Ursula y las Once Mil Virgenes’ – meaning ‘Saint Ursula and her 1100 Virgins’. Over the following 200 years the Spanish, British, Dutch, French and Danish competed for control as the islands became a haven for pirates. The British captured the Dutch settlement on Tortola Island in 1672 and annexed Anegada and Virgin Gorda, which would become part of what we now know as the British Virgin Islands. Meanwhile, the Danes gained control over Saint Thomas, Saint John and Saint Croix. In time the British established sugar cane plantations worked by slaves brought from Africa and the islands’ masters prospered until the mid-19th century when the abolition of slavery and a series of hurricanes all but destroyed the industry. In 1917 the USA bought the Danish islands for $25 million to establish the United States Virgin Islands. The British Virgin Islands were administered as part of the British Leeward Islands with St Kitts and Nevis, before gaining colony status in 1960 and autonomy in 1967. Under its latest constitution, adopted in 2007, HM The Queen remains Head of State with the elected premier, currently Orlando Smith, serving as head of government and presiding over the single chamber parliament. Did you know? •	Although the British Virgin Islands are made up of more than 60 islands and cays, only 15 are inhabited. •	Fungi, the traditional music of the islands, is named after a cornmeal dish made with okra. •	Financial services account for more than half the islands’ income leading some to label the territory as a tax haven. Mainly Christian, including Methodist (45%), Anglican (21%) and Roman Catholic (6%). The British Virgin Islands remain linked to the British Commonwealth, and the islanders reflect many British traditions and customs. The development of tourism proceeds with great caution; hence the unspoilt charm of these islands and cays remains the chief attraction. The pace of life is very easygoing. Shaking hands is the customary form of greeting. Dress is informal for most occasions apart from the formal requirements of some hotels. Beachwear should be confined to the beach or poolside. English.","The climate is subtropical and tempered by trade winds. There is little variation between summer and winter. Rainfall is low, varying slightly from island to island. Night-time temperatures drop to a comfortable level. Visitors should note that the British Virgin Islands are susceptible to hurricanes and earthquakes, although these are by no means a frequent occurrence. The primary hurricane season is from June to November. Tropical lightweights. Dress is generally informal but swimwear is confined to beaches. The 50-plus islands, rocks and cays of the British Virgin Islands, only 16 of which are inhabited, make up the larger part of an archipelago forming the northern extremity of the Leeward Islands in the eastern Caribbean. They are situated approximately 100km (62 miles) east of Puerto Rico, adjoining the US Virgin Islands. The islands are volcanic in origin, with the exception of Anegada, which is formed of coral and limestone and is the lowest lying. The topography is otherwise mountainous, the highest point being Tortola's Sage Mountain, which rises to 550m (1,800ft). There are remnants of a primeval rainforest on Tortola."
caribbean,cayman-islands,"Ask people to define their idea of paradise and they may well describe the Cayman Islands, a Caribbean archipelago renowned for its beautiful beaches, world-class diving and incredible food. Mere specs in the Caribbean Sea, the Caymans are made up of three islands in all: Grand Cayman, Cayman Brac and Little Cayman. These British Overseas Territories are home to around 50,000 people, a significant number of whom are British expatriates working in everything from finance and property to scuba diving and services. A trip to the Caymans is all about switching off. The extraordinary beaches on all three islands are perfect for whiling away lazy days, whilst the surrounding waters are a treasure trove of marine life, making them a hit with divers. The financial industry looms large over the islands and there’s no income tax, leading many to believe that paradise really does exist here. Still, the high duty on consumer goods, food and fuel makes the cost of living sharply felt. If you've got the cash, there’s an exceptional selection of high-end restaurants scattered across the archipelago – more than 200 on Grand Cayman alone. Island cuisine is also celebrated at Cayman Cookout, an annual culinary jamboree that attracts chefs from around the world. If that’s a bit highfalutin for you, then drop in at Taste of Cayman, which is a far more accessible food festival. The jamborees come thick and fast throughout the winter months. Pirates Week celebrates local culture and the archipelago’s swashbuckling history, while Heritage Days allow visitors to sample local food, entertainment and history of the island in even more detail. Another noteworthy jamboree is Batabano – the Cayman Islands’ own version of Carnival, complete with floats, extravagant costumes, steel bands and all the dancing you can muster. So pour out a glass of the local brew, Swanky, grab a spot on Seven Mile Beach, sit back and enjoy the show. 260 sq km (100 sq miles). 60,764 (UN estimate 2016). 215.7 per sq km. George Town. British overseas territory and parliamentary democracy. HM King Charles III since 2022, is represented by Governor Martyn Roper since 2018. Premier Juliana O'Connor-Connolly since 2023.","The two smaller Cayman islands – Little Cayman and Cayman Brac – were discovered by Columbus in 1503, who named them Las Tortugas (Spanish for turtles) after the vast numbers of turtles populating the islands. The Cayman Islands’ turtles remain a talking point for visitors to the islands. This is due to the unique fact that Cayman retains the right to eat the turtles, farmed at a special facility in West Bay that is also open to the public. So you can snorkel with the beautiful creatures then, erm, eat them. During the early 16th century, the islands’ name was changed to Cayman after the Carib word for a kind of crocodile which, although long gone, once was prevalent throughout the islands. Britain’s Sir Francis Drake explored the area in 1586, but it was 1670 before the islands came under full British rule. Many of the original settlers’ descendents can be seen in the islands’ surnames including Bodden, Ebanks and Kirkconnell. Grand Cayman was settled from Jamaica by 1672; Little Cayman and Cayman Brac were settled some time later, and maintained a separate administration until 1877. The surrounding waters were the backbone of the Cayman Island’s industries right up until the late 1900s; shipbuilding was a key source of income for the islands, as were fishing and turtling. Today, it is tourism that brings in much of the riches. Grand Cayman suffered a setback when it was battered by Hurricane Ivan in 2004, and the island all but shut down for numerous months while it was restored. Things have now recovered and it continues to attract high-end tourism to the country due to a combination of excellent infrastructure, top class hotels and of course the world-famous beaches and diving. The Governor of Jamaica held administrative responsibility for the islands until 1962, when Jamaica itself became independent. Since 1971, the Cayman Islands have had their own Governor appointed by the British crown. There is a directly elected Legislative Assembly which is responsible for the implementation of law in the Cayman Islands. The Governor has the power of veto which is rarely exercised. A constitution was passed in 2009 and occasional flirtations with financial problems have meant closer scrutiny by the UK. Independence is not likely in the near future as the island continues to recover from the financial crisis, which hit government coffers badly. The island continues to discuss modernisation in a series of public-private partnerships with potential cruise industry, airline industry and investment partners as Cayman does not have the resources to embark on capital projects any more. Christianity is the predominant religion with the denominations of Anglican, Catholicism, Baptist, and Presbyterian all represented on the island. Life on the Cayman Islands is a blend of local traditions and of US and British patterns of behaviour. Handshaking is the usual greeting; hugging and kissing is for friends and family only. Because of the large number of people with a similar surname (such as Ebanks and Bodden), a person may be introduced by his first name (such as Mr Tom or Mr Jim). Flowers are acceptable as a gift on arrival or following a visit for a meal. Most modes of dress are acceptable, although it is normal to prescribe a dress code on invitations. Save your beachwear for the actual beach however, as wearing skimpy clothing, or going without a shirt, in restaurants or bars will be frowned upon. Topless bathing is prohibited. Caymanians tend to be churchgoers, and island society is relatively conservative in terms of attitudes to LGBT rights; the government has been known to make anti-gay comments before, although homosexuality was decriminalised in 2000. English is the official language, with a distinctive 'brogue' reflecting heritage of Welsh, Scottish and English ancestors still distinguishing the speech of the Caymanian people. The number of Jamaican residents in the workforce means the Jamaican patois is also common. Spanish, particularly regional dialects of Central America and Cuba, is also widely spoken.","The Cayman Islands enjoy a very warm, tropical climate throughout the year, with temperatures that can reach highs of up 33°C (91°F) during the summer, moderated by trade winds. The best time to visit is during the dry months of December to April, when temperatures are generally cooler than in summer, hovering between 22°C (72°F) and 27°C (80°F). The rainy season is from May to October but showers are generally short and sharp (ie lasting hours rather than days); these can provide temporary respite from the hot summer sun. July and August are the hottest months, whilst the hurricane season is from June to November. Since the islands are low-lying, there is a high risk of flooding if a storm hits. During the dry season, wear lightweight, natural fabrics; temperatures rarely dip below 21°C (70°F), so you shouldn't need anything much heavier than this. A good strategy is to take layers, so that you can be ready for cooler conditions should the trade winds blow strongly. During the rainy season, bring a light raincoat or umbrella. Warmer clothes may be needed on cooler evenings. The Cayman Islands are situated in the Caribbean, around 440km (270 miles) northwest of Jamaica, 390km (240 miles) south of Cuba and 640km (400 miles) south of Miami. At around 197 sq km (76 sq miles) Grand Cayman is the largest and most populous island in this British overseas territory. Little Cayman and Cayman Brac lie around 130km (80 miles) northeast of Grand Cayman and are separated from each other by a channel about 16km (10 miles) wide. The islands are peaks of a very deep subterranean mountain range called Cayman Ridge, which extends from Cuba towards the Gulf of Honduras. All three islands are situated in some of the deepest waters in the Caribbean; the Cayman Trough which separates them from Jamaica reaches a depth of 6.4km (4 miles). The islands themselves are relatively low-lying, with the highest point on Grand Cayman reaching only 18m (60ft) above sea level. The Bluff, a magnificent limestone peak on Cayman Brac is the highest point on all three islands, reaching an elevation of 43m (140ft). The beaches on the Cayman Islands are considered some of the very best in the Caribbean, the most notable one being Seven Mile Beach on Grand Cayman. Casuarinas and sea-grape trees line many of the beaches, many of which are protected offshore by a fringing reef."
caribbean,cuba,"With pristine beaches, lush forests and vibrant cities all waiting to be explored, Cuba is more than a generic Caribbean island getaway. Cuba's capital, Havana, appears to be in a constant state of restoration, rather similar to the varying conditions of classic cars that roam its streets. Visitors can expect a mishmash of beautifully restored colonial buildings rubbing shoulders with dilapidated tenements of regular Cubans. The contrasts can be stark, but Havana's ubiquitous salsa rhythms and potent cocktails galvanise the city and make for an enthralling urban experience unlike any other. Cuba's other cities are experiences in themselves too. Santiago de Cuba is a veritable melting pot of Afro-Caribbean cultures, where pastel covered buildings meet grand cathedrals. And then there's Trinidad, which offers a snapshot of a bygone era with its cobblestone streets and faded colonial façades. Although the cities are delightful, for many visitors the greatest allure of Cuba is its beaches. Christopher Columbus described the sandy coast of Guardalavaca as ""the most beautiful land that human eyes have ever seen,"" and you can see why he was so taken – the impossibly white sands and warm turquoise waters are exquisite. Adventurers may prefer to head inland to hike, bike and explore the limestone caves of Viñales. Viñales is said to have been Fidel Castro's favourite place in Cuba and it is where the country's famous tobacco is cultivated. As Cuba slowly opens up to the rest of the world, modern resorts have become increasingly common, but the most rewarding stays are in casa particulares. These private homestays offer a true insight into everyday Cuban life, which you won't get in a hotel. While Cuba is still not an easy country to get your head around, its affable climate, captivating history, beautiful beaches and swinging salsa rhythms certainly reward those who visit and give it the time it deserves. 109,884 sq km (42,426 sq miles). 11,326,616 (UN estimate 2020). 106 per sq km.

Manuel Marrero Cruz since 2019.","Claimed by Christopher Columbus for Spain in 1492, Cuba developed to become the most important source of raw sugar for the Spanish empire in the 18th century. In the 19th century, Cuba fought two wars of independence. The first, between 1868 and 1878, ended in a truce with Spain promising greater autonomy, but the promises were never realised. The second war of independence began in 1895 when poet and revolutionary José Martí inspired the rebels to fight. The war ended in 1898 when the USA was drawn into the war and defeated Spain. Consequently, Spain gave up all claims to Cuba and ceded it to the US. In 1902, Cuba declared independence, but the US maintained political and economic control of the island. In 1933, Fulgencio Batista came to power in a coup – he ruled Cuba twice, from 1933-44, and from 1952-59. The second time he ruled Cuba as a corrupt dictator. Then came Fidel Castro and his rebel army, which overturned the Batista government in 1959, establishing a socialist state. All US businesses were nationalised without compensation in 1960, prompting Washington to break off all diplomatic relations with Cuba. In 1962, Cuba accelerated its relationships with the Soviet Union, allowing the USSR to deploy nuclear missiles on the island. When the USSR was dissolved in 1989, Cuba experienced an extraordinarily difficult economic period. Two decades later, President Obama signalled a new beginning with Cuba. He then visited Cuba in 2011, becoming the first sitting US President to visit Cuba since Coolidge in 1928. However, President Trump later overturned some aspects of the policy, reimposing restrictions on tourism and commerce. Fidel Castro resigned as President in 2008 in favour of his brother Raúl. Raúl served as the President until 2018 when he was succeeded by Miguel Diaz-Canel. Did you know? • The literacy rate in Cuba is 99.8%, one of the highest in the world. • Son Cubano, upbeat rhythms played with a classical guitar, is the most popular musical genre in Cuba. • Baseball is the most popular sport. Technically a Roman Catholic majority, though the percentage drops precipitously for practising Catholics. A variety of Afro-Cuban religions like Santería and Abakuá are widely practised. The typical greeting in Cuba is one kiss on the right cheek – although kisses are less usual among men unless they are great friends or family members. A handshake is acceptable for men and women in formal situations. Cubans tend to dress well when they go out for meetings or evenings out. Since the climate is warm and humid, most men opt for a cotton shirt (guayabera) with a pair of trousers. Men seldom wear shorts unless they are on the beach. Women tend to wear a dress when they go out. The official language is Spanish.

The dry season (late November to mid-April) is the best time to visit Cuba, and you can expect daytime temperatures to be around 26°C (79°F) to 30°C (86°F). It must be noted that rainfall does occur during the dry season – the sky will open up and rain hard for a few days a month. The rainy season (May to October) is wet and muggy. From August to October, tropical storms and cyclones are likely to affect the eastern part of Cuba. Hurricanes can happen during this period too. Shaped like a crocodile, Cuba is long and slender in size. The climate varies slightly from one side to the other. Generally, the northwestern part of Cuba (where Havana is located) is a few degrees cooler than the southeastern part from December to March, when the cool air from North America arrives. The best time to visit Havana: The best time to visit Havana is from December to March when the rainfall is at its lowest – February and March are the driest months with just 45mm (1.8 inches) of rain each month. But when it rains, expect a heavy downpour. Temperature-wise, you can expect average highs to be between 26°C (79°F) to 28°C (82°F) during this period. If you are visiting Havana from June to October, rain gear is a must. The best time to visit Santiago de Cuba: The second-largest city, Santiago de Cuba sits on the southern coast and enjoys slightly warmer weather than Havana. The best time to visit Santiago de Cuba is still from December to March, during the dry season, and you can expect an average high of 28°C (82°F). Rainfalls are frequent from May to October (except July). Cuba's tropical climate means lightweight cotton clothing is recommended year-round. Long-sleeves are ideal as they can protect you from mosquitoes bites. A light sweater is advisable for cooler evenings. Light waterproofs are useful during the dry season (late November to mid-April), while proper rain gear is essential during the rainy season (May to October). Cuba is the largest Caribbean island, about the size of England, and the most westerly of the Greater Antilles group, lying a mere 145km (90 miles) south of Florida. The country also includes about 1,600 other much smaller islands, islets and cays. The terrain of Cuba is mostly flat, but one-third of the country is mountainous, and the three most important mountain ranges are the Sierra de Los Órganos in the western region, the Sierra del Escambray in the central region, and the Sierra Maestra in the Eastern region. Pico Turquino in the Sierra Maestra range is the highest peak."
caribbean,curacao,"The southern Caribbean island of Curaçao boasts a vibrant cultural mix, from the colonial architecture of the Dutch to the mouth-watering cuisine of the Creole. This combined with the natural beauty of the island makes it a real gem worthy of discovery. Think rolling desert plains concealing rocky coves trimmed by massive cliffs, to long sandy beaches flanked by clear blue-green water, while leafy nature trails offer quiet seclusion – you'll find them crisscrossing much of the island. Wander past landhuizen, which means 'land houses', and old plantations juxtaposed near cacti clusters and desert shrubbery. The island's handsome UNESCO heritage capital of Willemstad offers visitors a window into the past with its pastel-coloured houses and cobblestone plazas. For the commercially minded, music-filled malls bustle with bag-laden shoppers and cut-price deals. Situated on the outer fringe of the hurricane belt, Curaçao weathers a strong breeze that lessens the intensity of the Caribbean sun. It also makes Curaçao ideal for water sports, while the island's stunning coral reef draws divers from across the globe. If it's the coastline you've come for, you won't be disappointed. There are some 40 beaches, some of them several kilometres long, with powdery sand that looks from a distance like blankets of silk. You'll also find a number of small coves; often you can claim them for yourself. Although for much of the year Curaçao is tranquil and sleepy, carnival is perhaps the best time to visit. A huge party engulfs the island, and more revellers are flocking here to take part in the festivities every year – part of what makes carnival so compelling here is the multicultural vibes of the inhabitants. So whether you want to lounge on a beach, explore rugged nature, wander colonial architecture or party until dawn, Curaçao will not disappoint. 444 sq km (171 sq miles). 158,635 (UN estimate 2016). 334.4 per sq km.

When the Netherlands gained independence from Spain in 1634 the Dutch East India Company seized control of the island, establishing its capital Willemstad on a natural harbour. Slaves were then imported to provide labour, initially for the salt mines, but subsequently for agricultural plantations and the island changed hands between the Dutch, the British and the French several times during the 18th and 19th centuries, before stable Dutch rule was re-established in 1815. The abolition of slavery in 1863 triggered economic decline, relieved in 1915 when Royal Dutch Shell built an oil refinery on the site of the former slave market at Asiento. It has been the hub of Curaçao’s economy ever since and provided a major source of fuel for Allied forces during WWII. Curaçao gained self-rule in 1954 as an island territory of the Netherlands Antilles and in 1984, the 30th anniversary of the first elected Island Council saw the inauguration of a national flag and anthem; then 21 years later islanders voted in favour of separate status, which was finally confirmed by the dissolution of the Netherlands Antilles and the creation of Curaçao as a country within the Kingdom of the Netherlands on 10 October 2010. Did you know? •	Curaçao also includes the uninhabited island of Klein Curaçao. •	Subject to state regulation, prostitution is legal on Curaçao and a large open-air brothel has been run near the airport since the 1940s. •	Derived from African and Portuguese, Papiamento is an official language on Curaçao with Dutch and English. The majority of the population is Roman Catholic, with Protestant minorities, both evangelical and other low-church denominations. There is also a Baha'i temple and a synagogue. The social influences are predominantly Dutch, combined with Indian and African traditions. Men wear tropical lightweight suits for business appointments and formal wear for evening engagements. Similarly, women should take some evening wear, but dress for daytime is casual. Swimwear should be confined to the beach and poolside. Dutch is the official language.

caribbean,dominica,"The Caribbean island of Dominica is a natural treasure. Visitors will find a medley of brooding volcanic peaks, gushing mountain streams, dense forests, quiet lakes and spouting geysers. As you might have already guessed, it's a diverse and beautiful land. Given its natural assets and warm and welcoming locals, Dominica should be a bustling tourism hotspot. Despite being one of the poorest in the region, crime is relatively low. But a marked lack of pumping nightlife, no direct flights to Dominica from the UK and little in the way of sandy beaches all mean it remains off the radar for many travellers. And yet this is what makes the island so appealing for the intrepid few. Those partial to hiking amid thick tropical rainforest and gazing at bubbling lakes, will find this sunny green isle has many charms. In fact, much of Dominica is the domain of sprawling jungle, making it ideal for trekking. Adventuring your way around Dominica's natural delights is very much a primordial experience. On your travels through red mud trails and over undulating volcanic slopes, you'll find thundering waterfalls, hot springs where you can let nature heal your aches and pains, and even swim through a narrow gorge. Explore colourful coral reef with your snorkelling gear, be buoyed by bubbling volcanic water and visit the rawest spas imaginable – Dominica has so much to offer. Perhaps the most attractive thing about the island, though, is the very thing that keeps the hordes away. Dominica has avoided mass tourism, and as a haven where Mother Nature is in charge, unspoilt by human hands. Having been both a French and British colony, the 70,000 or so inhabitants have various roots, including the indigenous Caribs, though the people are largely African in origin. As for visitors, they see Dominica as an unblemished alternative to the more commercial Caribbean islands. Here you can get away from the crowds, welcomed by the friendliest of local populations. 751 sq km (290 sq miles). 73,016 (UN estimate 2016). 98 per sq km. Roseau. Republic. President Sylvanie Burton since 2023. Prime Minister Roosevelt Skerrit since 2004.","Before being discovered by Christopher Columbus in 1493, Dominica’s mountainous natural beauty was originally enjoyed by the Carib Indians who made the island their home in the 14th century. The Caribs called their sunny isle Waitukubuli, meaning ‘Tall is her body, and some Carib descendants remain in Dominica today – the last surviving community of this indigenous group. Following Columbus’ arrival, the island became known as Dominica, taking its name from the day he landed (Dominica is Latin for Sunday). France colonised it in the 1600s, before, in 1805, the island became a British possession, remaining under British rule until the late 1960s. During both world wars thousands of Dominicans volunteered to fight in Europe for the Allies and the country provided a place of safety for Free French refugees fleeing the Vichy-controlled French islands. Dominica has been nicknamed the ‘Nature Isle of the Caribbean’ on account of its stunning natural features, not least Boiling Lake, the appropriately named hot spring – the second largest in the world. Since 1978, the island has enjoyed full independence although self-rule has been somewhat stormy, with two coup attempts by leftist members of the island’s Defence Force during the early 1980s. The arrival of Hurricane David in 1979 brought mass chaos as the immense tropical storm damaged three quarters of the island, destroying homes and killing 42 people. A bus still remains to this day crushed under a storm-felled tree in Rousea’s Botanical Gardens. After the 1980 elections Dominica appointed Eugenia Charles, the Caribbean’s first female prime minister. Politically, the early 2000s proved eventful, with two Prime Ministers – Roosevelt Douglas and Pierre Charles – both dying while in office. Since 2004, Roosevelt Skerrit has been leading the country and remains a popular figure. In recent years, Dominica has developed a close, if controversial, relationship with Japan, which has provided extensive development aid including a modern fisheries complex. In exchange, Dominica now supports Japan’s much criticised efforts to undermine international controls on whaling. Nevertheless, given the island’s serious economic problems, the deal enjoys wide popular support. Did you know? • Dominica’s national bird is the Sisserou parrot, which features on the national flag. • The Commonwealth of Dominica has emerged as a major international offshore financial centre thanks to its low-tax regime. • Playwright and novelist Jean Rhys was born in Dominica, which features as the ‘honeymoon island’ in her best known work, Wide Sargasso Sea.

The island features five volcanoes, and the greenery is protected by several conservation areas including Cabrits National Park and Morn trois Pitons National Park; throughout the island run mountain streams, rivers, lakes and waterfalls, and bursting geysers and bubbling volcanic pools make the scenery even more breathtaking. The rich vegetation of the island's spectacular valleys includes towering palms and orchids, and is home to several endemic animal species, while the coast boasts beaches of both black (volcanic) and golden sand."
caribbean,dominican-republic,"Dominican Republic is ensconced as the Caribbean’s most visited destination. It’s not hard to see why; a seemingly endless spread of white-sandy beaches and palm trees play host to a similarly sizeable range of holiday resorts. The country has developed a reputation for a good-quality break at a reasonable price, for what it’s worth. With its 32km (20 miles) stretch of beaches and clear blue sea, the region around Punta Cana on the east coast is particularly popular, offering golf courses, all-inclusive holidays and the usual fun-in-the-sun trappings. Dominican Republic makes up one half of the island of Hispaniola – which it shares with Haiti in the west. The country is one of the most geographically diverse parts of the Caribbean, showcasing everything from tropical rainforests and high-mountain ranges to mangrove swamps and semi-deserts. Mountain-bikers, windsurfers, hikers, climbers and even whale-watchers are well catered for. No less notably, however, the Dominican Republic is heaving with life, blending the heady rhythms of merengue and bachata music, with a fondness for rum and religion, not to mention a near-unrivalled passion for baseball. The country has a long history. It was the first part of the region to be discovered by Christopher Columbus in 1492. A visit to capital city Santo Domingo still makes the most natural starting point for cultural visitors. The oldest fortress Fortaleza Ozama (built in 1502) and colonial-era churches still stand proud, while the city as a whole is a thrusting, energetic destination full of speaker-blaring corner stores and dance-till-you-drop nightclubs. While it’s a large country by Caribbean standards, it remains relatively easy to combine different elements of the destination in one itinerary. And whether you’re here for the beaches, the music, the countryside or the culture, the DR in full swing is a force to be reckoned with. 48,442 sq. km (18,792 sq. miles). 10,776,988 (UN estimate 2016).   233 per sq. km (86.1 sq. miles). Santo Domingo. Republic. President Luis Abinader since 2020. President Luis Abinader since 2020.","Christopher Columbus discovered the island of Hispaniola, which comprises present-day Dominican Republic and Haiti, in 1492 and established it as his main base for the further exploration of the region. For two centuries the Spanish ruled the island, but as they became increasingly distracted by their fledgling settlements on the mainland, English pirates plundered and ransacked almost at will, while French colonisers threatened to take over. Finally, in 1697, western Hispaniola (present-day Haiti) came under French control, with the east remaining under Spanish control, a division that still exists today, with the Dominican Republic and Haiti sharing the island. A century later, Santo Domingo (the oldest city in the Americas), which was founded by Columbus' brother in 1496, was ceded to the French; the rest of the island soon followed suit. The Battle of Palo Hincado, in 1808, heralded the collapse of French rule in the eastern part of the island. The colony reverted to Spanish sovereignty the following year, and in 1821, the colonial treasurer, José Nunez de Caceres, proclaimed Santo Domingo's independence. This independence was short-lived, however, as in 1822, the Haitians invaded the colony and occupied it for 22 years, until, on 27th February 1844, the territory of Santo Domingo recovered its sovereignty and declared independence as the Dominican Republic. After years of civil war and US occupation, the republic was taken over by General Rafael Trujillo (1930-1961), whose dictatorship was characterised by cruelty and megalomaniac excess. Finally, after years of brutally oppressing his opponents, Trujillo was assassinated in 1961, prompting a period of civil unrest. Since then, the country has had a series of Presidents and each has tried to rebuild and diversify its economy. Today, the service sector has overtaken agriculture and is now the largest contributor to the GDP. Did you know? •	Dictator Rafael Trujillo (1891-1961) was famous for his love of fine clothes. He had almost two thousand suits and more than ten thousand neckties. •	Santo Domingo is the oldest city in the new world. •	The flag of the Dominican Republic is thought to be the only flag in the world that features a Bible. Roman Catholic 95% Dominicans are friendly and hospitable, with a big emphasis on family value and loyalty. It is not uncommon to see your hosts go out of their way to make you feel comfortable. Social appearance is important. Daytime dress is generally casual but beachwear and shorts are only acceptable in resorts and at pools; it is rare for locals to enter a church wearing shorts or a T-shirt. In many areas, evenings tend to be smarter, with dressing up common at better restaurants, hotels and for social functions. Spanish is the official language although some English and French are spoken.","The climate in Dominican Republic is generally hot with tropical temperatures all year, although it does vary from region to region. In Santo Domingo, the temperatures are constant throughout the year, ranging between 25°C (77°F) and 28°C (82°F) while rain falls abundantly from May to November. The resort town Punta Cana on the east coast is extremely popular with European and American tourists from December to March who seek to escape the cold in the northern hemisphere. In January, the average high in Punta Cana is 29°C (84°F) while the average low is 21°C (70°F). Precipitation is high from June to November, with a risk of hurricanes too. April is the shoulder season, meaning good weather (27°C/81°F) and fewer crowds. If you're visiting the mountainous interior, it's best to pack a light sweater as it can get very cold at high elevations. Lightweight fabrics are best suited to the tropical temperatures. Waterproofs are essential during the rainy seasons. The Dominican Republic shares the Caribbean island of Hispaniola with the nation of Haiti. It is larger than its French-speaking neighbour, occupying two-thirds of the landmass. A series of mountain belts stretch across the border region, most notably in the form of the Cordillera Central; at 3,175m (10,414ft) the peak of Pico Duarte represents the highest point of the country. The Dominican landscape is frequently forested and often undulating, with a multitude of valleys, plains and plateaux. The soil is fertile with excellent white beaches on the north, southeast and east coasts. Ten per cent of the country was set aside in the 1970s to be protected as national parks and science reserves, and, in spite of occasional hurricanes and fires, these areas remain largely intact. Today there are 17 national parks in the Dominican Republic. Capital city Santo Domingo sits on the south coast (providing a popular stop-off for cruise ships), while the country's second largest city, Santiago, is located in the central northwest region. The Reserva Cientifica Banco de Plata is an underwater park located off the north coast, set up to preserve a breeding ground for the thousands of humpback whales that visit each winter."
caribbean,french-overseas-possessions,"French Guiana is a tropical backwater with intriguing highlights to satisfy the curious traveller: from rich wildlife encounters to cultural curiosities that sound like the setting for a Evelyn Waugh novel, including the launch site of the European Space Programme, chilling ruins of notorious penal colonies, and isolated indigenous communities. Tucked between the Brazilian Amazon and the Atlantic Ocean, the sparsely populated country harbours an abundance of plants and animals, well protected in parks and reserves. As an overseas French département, French is the official language. With the Euro as its currency, prices are on a par with Europe, not cheap. Despite its lack of beaches and swampy coastline, exploration of the jungle-clad interior reveals rewarding sights. St Laurent is the best gateway, an appealing colonial city and former penal transportation centre. Guided tours of the prison are available, and boats go down the Marowijne River, to visit Amerindian and Maroon villages. The welcoming locals have handicrafts for sale, and you can trek to beaches where leatherback turtles lay their eggs. French Guiana’s most notorious penal camp was on the Iles du Salut, which include the infamous Devil's Island where political prisoners were held. Some 80,000 men died here from cruel hardship, disease and execution. Alfred Dreyfus was the most famous inmate, but it was Henri Charriere who recreated the camp’s horrors in his book, Papillon. Tours of the restored ruins relive this grim history, lightened up by the island’s rich wildlife, including parrots, monkeys and turtles. By way of contrast, the other major attraction for visitors is the Ariane Space Station, Europe’s satellite launch centre. From the small coastal city of Kourou you can visit the centre, and watch rocket launches. Nearby are some decent beaches to lounge on afterwards, or visit the village of Sinnamary, where an Indonesian community sells handicrafts and art works. 83,534 sq km (32,253 sq miles). 275,688 (UN estimate 2016). 3 per sq km.

President Gabriel Serville since 2021.","French Guiana was discovered by the Spanish in 1496, displacing the original inhabitants, who were tribal Amerindian peoples, including Arawaks and Caribs. A century later, French settlers moved in, forming trading colony in Cayenne and along the coast. Under the 1667 Treaty of Breda, the Dutch, who had also shown an interest in the area, were forced out. Numerous changes in control followed over the next 200 years, alternating between France, Britain, the Netherlands and Portugal, until the territory was finally confirmed as French in 1817. The colony enjoyed a brief period of prosperity in the 1850s when gold was discovered, but afterwards went into a decline from which it has never fully recovered. Penal colonies for French convicts were also built on the offshore Devils’ Island in the 1850s. Inmates included the convicted murderer, Henri Charriere, who wrote about his brutal treatment in the prison (and his subsequent escape) in his book Papillon. French Guiana was finally given French Overseas Department status in 1946. However, the territory was largely neglected by Paris, and continued to deteriorate until civil unrest broke out in the 1970s. After a security crackdown, the central government promised various improvements. These failed to materialise until the Mitterrand presidency, under which a series of reforms was introduced in 1982 and 1983. Some decentralisation also took place: local affairs are now dealt with by the Regional Council. The economy has been boosted since the 1960s by the construction of the European Space Agency’s Guiana Space Centre in Kourou, which was built there because of its proximity to the equator. European and Russian space missions still use the site, which is also one of French Guiana’s top tourist attractions. The domestic political agenda has been generally dominated by heated complaints over the territory's relatively poor social and economic conditions compared to those in France. The alternatives to being an integral part of the French state are self-government and independence. However, enthusiasm for either is lacking, and the small independence movement has made little headway in recent years. The French government has also made it clear that it will not countenance any change in French Guiana's status for the time being. Did you know? •	The notoriously harsh penal colonies of the offshore Iles du Salut, housed some 80,000 French criminals during the 19th and 20th centuries – most never returned. •	The French Foreign Legion has a regiment based in French Guiana, whose job is to protect the Guiana Space Centre. •	The original Galibi and Palikur inhabitants of French Guiana resisted enslavement by the colonial invaders, who instead imported thousands of slaves from Africa.

caribbean,french-overseas-possessions,"Scattered throughout the world are various French Overseas Possessions. A hangover from the colonial era, these possessions fall into various classifications: French Overseas Departments (Départements d'Outre-Mer or DOM), French Overseas Territories (Territoires d'Outre-Mer or TOM), French Overseas Collectivities (Collectivités Territoriales or COM) and French Special Collectivity. The following DOM and TOMs all have their own sections: French Guiana, Guadeloupe, Martinique, New Caledonia, Réunion and Tahiti. Basic information on the others is given here: French Overseas Departments There are five overseas departments, each one an integral part of the French Republic. Guadeloupe and Martinique are both in the Caribbean; French Guiana is on the northwest coast of South America; and Réunion and Mayotte are both in the Indian Ocean. Despite the greater autonomy achieved with the formation of their own individual Regional Councils in 1974, each French Overseas Department still returns elected representatives to the Senate and National Assembly in Paris, as well as to the European Parliament in Strasbourg. French Overseas Territories The French Southern and Antarctic Lands are located in the Southern Indian Ocean and are the only French Overseas Territories. Comprised of five islands in all, each one is home to a handful of inhabitants and is administered by an appointed representative of the French government. French Overseas Collectivities There are five French Overseas Collectivities in all. French Polynesia is found in the Pacific Ocean; Wallis and Futuna is also found in the Pacific Ocean; St-Pierre and Miquelon is found near Newfoundland, Canada; and Saint Barthélemy and Saint Martin are both located in the Caribbean. They are integral parts of the French Republic and are administered by a Prefect appointed by the French government. French Special Collectivity New Caledonia, located in the South Pacific, was formerly a French Overseas Territory, but gained special status in 1999 following the Nouméa Accord in 1998. The French government is represented in New Caledonia by the high commissioner and two deputies are also elected to the National Assembly in Paris.  2.1 million (Insee estimate 2016)",,
caribbean,grenada,"As far as paradise islands go, few come more beautiful than Grenada. A mountainous and volcanic landscape gives the country one of the loveliest environments in the Caribbean, with crater lakes, rainforests and coastal mangrove plantations giving way to white sand beaches, and brilliant blue waters filled with coral reefs. What's not to like? Grenada is known as the Spice Island for good reason. Nutmeg, cloves, cinnamon, ginger and vanilla are just a few of the scented gems found here. When it comes to food, Grenadians like it particularly hot and spicy. Pepper pot is a favourite – meat cooked with lots of garlic, onions and, you guessed it, pepper. As well as fragrant spices, music is also an important part of life on Grenada, with the calypso tunes dancing over the island evoking Grenadians' African origins. Many will, of course, be drawn to Grenada for its beaches. They are several dozen of them, immaculate and well-preserved, while digging a bit deeper will bring you to isolated coves where it'll be just you and the sea. Bring your snorkelling gear – there are plenty of colourful fish species to be glimpsed. If there's only so much lounging on a beach you can tolerate, pick up one of the many nature trails running across the island that'll take you through wilderness brimming with wildlife. Expect to see rare birds in the rainforest and monkeys in the loftier terrain. You're also likely to cross one or two spice plantations, whose beguiling aromas are one of the trademarks of Grenada. The capital, St George's, is a pretty city boasting one of the finest beaches in the Caribbean, Grand Anse. Meanwhile, day trips to neighbouring islands come highly recommended for those keen on sailing, diving and fishing. For unassailable tranquility, spend some time on the islet of Carriacou, whose simple, idyllic way of life is sure to charm. In fact, on the whole of Grenada, there are no colossal resorts, meaning peace, quiet and nature are largely the order of the day, along with a friendly and welcoming population. 344 sq km (132 sq miles). 107,327 (UN estimate 2016). 321.8 per sq km. Saint George’s. Constitutional monarchy. HM King Charles III since 2022, represented locally by Governor-General Dame Cécile La Grenade since 2013. Prime Minister Dickon Mitchell since 2022.","For a small island, Grenada has had a turbulent history. The earliest known inhabitants were Arawak Indians, who were then displaced by Caribs some time before AD 1300. The first serious attempt at settlement by Europeans was in 1609, but the Caribs resisted fiercely and it was not until 1650 that the French were able to claim the island. It remained a French colony until taken by the British in 1783. Grenada was an important centre in the slave trade between Africa and the sugar plantations of the West Indies. With the emancipation of slaves and the disintegration of the plantation system, the majority of islanders came to depend on a few local industries and their own smallholdings. Radical politics have been a hallmark of Grenadian society since the early 1950s when trade union organisation, promoted by Eric Gairy, a firebrand ex-teacher, took root among the workforce. Gairy ultimately led Grenada into independence from the UK in February 1974, and subsequently won three elections for the premiership. Not all were content with Gairy's regime, however, and among his opponents was the New JEWEL Movement (Joint Endeavour for Welfare, Education and Liberation), a group of mainly young, educated left-wingers led by Maurice Bishop. In the spring of 1979, the NJM deposed Gairy in a bloodless coup. The USA believed that the NJM was determined to turn Grenada into a mini-Cuba, and from 1980 onwards increased political pressure against the Government. The question of how to respond to this, and other issues, split the NJM leadership, and led to the military coup of October 1983 in which Bishop was killed. The coup provided a pretext for the US invasion and the restoration of the pre-NJM system of government under the tutelage of the USA. Four existing political parties allied to form the New National Party (NNP), under the leadership of the veteran politician Herbert Blaize, to keep out Eric Gairy who was still on the scene. At the general election in December 1984, the NNP won handsomely. The NNP has dominated Grenadian politics ever since, and won the most recent election held in November 2003, where it swept the board for the House of Representatives. Party leader Keith Mitchell is now into his third term as Prime Minister. Mitchell's government continues the NNP tradition of very close relations with the USA, although a sharp drop in financial support led Mitchell, along with other East Caribbean leaders, to seek economic assistance elsewhere. The Organisation of East Caribbean States plays an important part in Grenada's foreign policy. A proposed political union comprising the member of the organisation has aroused fierce opposition because of historic inter-island rivalries, although its supporters (who include the Mitchell government) feel it essential to the future prosperity and security of the region. Roman Catholic 53%, Anglican 14%, smaller Protestant denominations 33%. Local culture reflects the island's history of British and French colonial rule and, of course, the African cultures imported with the slaves - African influence is especially noticeable on the island of Carriacou in the Big Drum and in Grenada with the Shango dance. The Roman Catholic Church also exerts a strong influence on the way of life. Local people are generally friendly and courteous. Dress is casual and informal but beachwear is not welcome in town.

The island is of volcanic origin and is divided by a central mountain range. It is the most southerly of the Windward Islands. Its agriculture is based on nutmeg (one third of the world's nutmeg supply comes from Grenada), cocoa, sugar cane and bananas. Tropical rainforests, gorges and the stunning beauty of dormant volcanoes make this a fascinating and diverse landscape with some of the finest beaches in the world. Carriacou and some of the other small islands of the Grenadines are also part of Grenada."
caribbean,guadeloupe,"A butterfly-shaped archipelago in the Caribbean Sea, Guadeloupe is a picture of tropical island idyll – no wonder the French are reluctant to let it go. Known as Karukera to the original Caraïbe inhabitants, this French overseas region might share the same attributes as other coveted Caribbean destinations – white powdery beaches, vertiginous mountains and dazzling coral reefs – but Guadeloupe’s Franco-Caribbean culture sets the archipelago apart from its neighbours. Ascribed by Jacques Cousteau as one of the world’s premier diving destinations, Guadeloupe was at the front of the queue when they were giving out natural beauty; from the lofty heights of La Grande Soufrière volcano to the resplendent reefs of the Pigeon Islets, this archipelago is exquisite on the eye. Comprising eight islands and numerous small islets, Guadeloupe’s varied typography is a big draw for adventure travellers, who come to trek the terrain, ride the waves and cycle through a slice of paradise. But the archipelago is also a hit with more sedentary travellers, who while away lazy days on sandy shores and quaff rum in ramshackle beach bars to the rousing rhythms of Guadeloupian beguine. Each island, of course, has its own character, but few travellers have time to visit them all. Most base themselves on one of the two main islands – Basse-Terre and Grande-Terre – which are linked by dense mangrove swamps rich in wildlife. These two islands are home to Guadeloupe’s main resorts; they are where most of the hotels and evening entertainment can be found; where you can eat at the best restaurants; and fall out of the best bars. They are also home to the archipelago’s leading historical attractions, including forts, defunct sugar plantations and museums, which, between them, trace the DNA of modern day Guadeloupe and explain how it remains an unlikely member of the European Union. 1,705 sq km (658 sq miles). 470,547 (UN estimate 2016). 236.8 per sq km.

They had a good run, but when a rival ethnic group know as the Caraïbes arrived in the 8th century, they exterminated the Arawaks in a merciless slaughter, claiming a land that had been peaceful for centuries. In 1493, Christopher Columbus became the first European to land on Guadeloupe. His expedition left behind no settlers, but the Spanish soon started to stake their claim to the archipelago and attempted to colonise the island. But the fearsome Caraïbes stood their ground and repelled them. Cue the French, who succeeded where the Spanish failed by colonising Guadeloupe in 1635, eliminating the Caraïbes in the process. The French quickly established Guadeloupe as one of the leading players in the booming sugar industry, but while the motherland enjoyed the sweet taste of success, African slaves toiled relentlessly in the plantations. The outbreak of the French Revolution in 1789 brought tumult to Guadeloupe. The republicans and monarchists fought bitterly and by 1793 a slave rebellion had broken out. The British took advantage of the chaos and seized the island the following year, but it was back in French hands by the end of 1794. Well, sort of. Guadeloupe was largely under the control of slaves, until 1802 when Napoleon Bonaparte sent forces to retake the island and reinstate slavery. His forces killed an estimated 10,000 people. The British seized the island again in 1810 and Guadeloupe spent the next six years being occupied by the Brits, Swedes and, finally, the French. In 1848, the French Parliament voted for the Abolition Decreet; brought in by Viktor Schoelcher, it signalled the end of slavery on Guadeloupe. In 1946, Guadeloupe became a French Overseas Department. It uses the Euro and is a member of the European Union, through France. An independence movement, most active in the eighties, still simmers beneath the surface. Did you know? • Though cultivated for centuries by natives, Christopher Columbus discovered the pineapple for Europe when he landed on Guadeloupe in 1493. • Guadeloupe host an annual festival dedicated to goats, which includes a goat fashion parade. • Christopher Columbus named the island Santa Maria de Guadalupe in honour of the eponymous monastery in the Spanish town of Guadalupe. The majority are Roman Catholic, with a minority of predominantly Evangelical Protestant groups. The atmosphere is relaxed and informal. Casual dress is accepted everywhere, but formal dress is needed for dining out and nightclubs. The official language is French. The lingua franca is Creole.

Showers can, however, occur at any time although they are usually brief. The humidity can be exceedingly high at times. Lightweights with warmer top layers for the evenings; showerproofs are advisable. Guadeloupe comprises the larger islands of Basse-Terre and Grande-Terre (separated from Basse-Terre by a narrow sea channel) and three smaller islands. Basse-Terre has a rough volcanic relief whilst Grande Terre features rolling hills and flat plains. All the islands have beautiful white or black-sand palm-fringed beaches.

caribbean,haiti,"Haiti is a country guaranteed to shock and awe. Tragedy-scarred but tenacious, this small Caribbean nation has great beauty and great need. Boasting verdant mountains, white sandy beaches and plenty of African spontaneity, Haiti might be financially poor, but it is rich in natural beauty, culturally affluent. Sharing the island of Hispaniola with the Dominican Republic, Haiti has all the hallmarks of a classic Caribbean destination. And so it was, in the 1960s and 70s, when the wealthy flocked here to relax in the tropical climate, tread upon powdery beaches and explore vertiginous mountain ranges. However, decades of political instability and a series of natural disasters devastated Haiti’s tourist industry, and saw the country go from the travel sections of newspapers straight to the front pages. But, slowly, holidaymakers are returning. Led by the luxury end of the market, new hotels are opening all the time in Port au Prince, which is a sign of how the tide is finally turning. As well as new hotels, numerous tourism development projects are also underway. Haiti’s unique selling proposition as a Caribbean destination is its history and culture. It has a vibrant arts scene, irresistible fusion cuisine and many talented musicians, who pack out bars and clubs with their unique brand of African, European and Caribbean beats. However, travelling around Haiti is not always easy. The country’s infrastructure has not recovered from decades of instability and the devastating earthquake of 2010. Political uncertainty endures, too; the United Nations’ Stabilization Force for Haiti – known by its French acronym MINUSTAH – is still here ten years after it was sent in to restore political order. In the short term, then, the best option for those travelling to Haiti is to use the services of a known tour operator. This might not feel particularly adventurous, but it will take the hassle out of visiting a nation that is still finding its feet after years in the wilderness. 27,750 sq km (10,714 sq miles). 10,848,175 (UN estimate 2016). 360.2 per sq km.

The Spanish colonised this new land, brutally supplanting the Arawak Indian inhabitants, and using the island to launch their conquests of the Caribbean and Central America By the 16th century, Spain>'s European rivals began challenging for control of Santo Domingo and in 1697 they ceded the western half of the island to France, which now forms modern-day Haiti. The French turned their new territory into a major centre for the slave trade, but their control of Haiti was brought to an end in 1804 by what became the only successful slave rebellion ever to take place. The 19th century in newly independent Haiti was characterised by political and social unrest. Dictators came and went but none had the wherewithal to unite the country's two main ethnic groups: the mulattos and the blacks. And then Jean-Pierre Boyer entered the scene. One of the leaders of the Haitian Revolution, he became president in 1818 and presided over a period of relative calm. Having consolidated power in Haiti, in 1822 Boyer occupied neighbouring Dominican Republic which had recently declared independence from Spain. He met little resistance and the territories remained unhappily married until 1844. Spiralling debt and a devastating earthquake in 1842 tipped Haiti back towards instability, which culminated in a US occupation in 1915. Concerned by their financial exposure in Haiti, the US invaded the country and stayed until 1934; a period in which Haitian’s human rights were sacrificed on the altar of economic development. The US left Haiti much as they found it: politically unstable. Dictatorships, military juntas and economic malaise defined the decades that followed, culminating in the arrival of a UN stabilisation mission, which was sent to Haiti in 2004 and remains there to this day. It took two years before calm returned to Haiti’s streets. Rene Preval returned as president while the UN dealt with gangs that made the security situation difficult. And then a devastating act of nature brought further destruction to the embattled nation. Estimated to have killed up to 220,000 people, the 2010 earthquake brought death and unimaginable misery to millions of Haitians and rebuilding has been the country’s focus ever since. Did you know? • Haiti is the first and only country in the world whose independence came from a successful slave rebellion. • Haiti is the only country in the world where voodoo is an official religion. • There are more mountains in Haiti than on any other Caribbean island. The official religions are Roman Catholicism (75%) and Voodooism (70%); most Haitians practise both. Voodooism is a polytheistic folk religion, manifested by a series of complex ritual drawings, songs and dances. It is an African religion, and not incompatible with a shared belief in Christianity. There are Protestant minorities. Informal wear is acceptable, although beachwear should be confined to the beach or poolside. Only the most elegant dining-rooms encourage guests to dress for dinner.

caribbean,jamaica,"The famous birthplace of Bob Marley, reggae and the Rastafari movement, Jamaica’s cultural offering to the world is far greater than its size might suggest. With varying degrees of success, beach resorts around the world have attempted to emulate the Jamaican seaside vibe, but once you’ve felt the sand between your toes on this Caribbean island, you’ll accept no substitutes. But it’s so much more than a beach destination. Beyond the swaying palms and white sands lie misty coffee plantations, the epic Blue Mountains, raging rivers prime for rafting and forests alive with exotic species. It’s not all wild. Manicured parks and gardens are a Jamaican speciality, and you can spot exuberant clusters of tropical blooms on any street corner of this fertile island. At the heart of it all, though, is music. From bass-heavy beats pumping out of Kingston’s frenetic nightclubs to harmonious choirs singing in village churches, it is in the air wherever you go. If song satisfies Jamaica’s sensual needs, food and drink tend to its soul. Culinary delights range from gourmet seafood in award-winning restaurants to street-side jerk chicken washed down with a chilled can of Red Stripe. You can taste some of the world’s best rum and coffee here, not to mention a sumptuous range of tropical fruits. Negril and Montego Bay are Jamaica’s two main coastal resorts, with exquisite sands, lively clubs, fine restaurants and world-class golf. And then there’s Kingston, the island’s spirited capital and home of the island’s music scene, where grand Georgian plazas and elegant mansions are serenaded by soca rhythms and the pulsating buzz of the city. Sleepy fishing villages offer a glimpse of Jamaica’s quieter side, but ultimately, whether it’s high-octane adventure or slow travel you’re looking for, you’ll soon be seduced by the rhythm of life on this irresistible island. 10,992 sq km (4,244 sq miles). 2,881,000 (World Bank estimate 2016). 266 sq km. Kingston. Constitutional monarchy. HM King Charles III since 2022, represented locally by Governor-General Sir Patrick Linton Allen since 2009. Prime Minister Andrew Holness since 2016.","Before Columbus discovered it in 1494, modern-day Jamaica, then known as Xaymaca, had been peacefully inhabited by the native Arawak Indians for about 2,000 years. All of that changed in an instant as the Spanish swiftly colonised the island, driving the Arawaks out, replacing them with slaves from Africa and holding control of Jamaica until the mid-17th century. The Spanish left Jamaica in 1655, in the wake of British pirates and settlers who turned Jamaica into the most important of the British Caribbean slaving colonies. The new capital Kingston soon became a vital point of the vicious trade triangle bringing many thousands more slaves to the island from Africa and exporting rum and sugar back to Europe. Even today no other island in the Caribbean feels its bonds with the African continent more keenly, and for the past centuries it has defined the island’s very culture. It was a key event in Jamaican history therefore, when, in 1834, slavery was abolished, a date considered to be the birth of the modern nation. Jamaica remained a British crown colony, however, and it was not until the early 20th century that rising independence movements began to gain momentum. The 1920s saw the rise of black political activity as Jamaica’s second-most-famous-son Marcus Garvey founded the ‘Back to Africa’ movement, which encouraged Jamaicans to return to their homeland. The Rastafarian religion grew out of this movement after the now-deceased Haile Selassie was crowned King of Ethiopia. Believers consider Selassie to be a messiah who will return Jamaicans to Africa and bestow upon them peace and prosperity. Jamaica was finally granted independence in 1962, remaining a member of the Commonwealth. This was the decade that saw the blossoming of reggae, the musical message that put Jamaica firmly on the map with the arrival of the legendary Bob Marley. Since independence, the political arena has been dominated by the struggle between the right-wing Jamaican Labour Party (JLP) and the leftist People's National Party (PNP). The economy has been boosted by a recent rise in tourism, which accounts for some 60% of GDP. Did you know? • Ian Fleming wrote ten of his James Bond spy thrillers at his home in Jamaica. •	Jamaica’s original Arawak inhabitants named the island Xaymaca, which means “land of wood and water”. •	Jamaican sprinters have dominated world athletics since 2005, when Asafa Powell set a new 100m Olympic record, which was subsequently beaten by Usain Bolt. Jamaica has the most churches per capita of any country in the world. Protestant majority (Anglican, Baptist, Church of God and Methodist) with Roman Catholic, Jewish, Muslim, Hindu and Bahai communities. Rastafarianism, a religion based on belief in the divinity of the late Emperor of Ethiopia, Haile Selassie (Ras Tafari), is also widely practised. Jamaica also has a number of small spiritualist cults. Away from the fast-paced capital city, Jamaica is slow and relaxed. Handshaking is the customary form of greeting. Jamaicans are hospitable and it is not uncommon to be invited into a local home where normal social conventions apply. When it comes to day attire, beachwear is only considered appropriate for the poolside or the sand and is frowned upon elsewhere. Eveningwear varies, from the formal jacket-and-tie dress codes in many top restaurants to the more relaxed casual clothing in beach bars. Marijuana, or ganja as it is known in Jamaica, is illegal to possess, use or export. Possession may lead to imprisonment and deportation. The official language is English, but Patois is the conversational dialect most Jamaicans use on a day to day basis.","Consistently warm tropical weather ensures Jamaica is a popular destination year-round. On the coast, temperatures range from 22°C (72°F) and 31°C (88°F) with chilly mornings and evenings denoting winter. However, many people say the best time to visit is November to mid-December because of the pleasant weather and available hotel and flight deals. Peak season runs roughly from mid-December to mid-April when crowds swell and prices rise. The wettest months are May and October, but showers may occur at any time. Between June and November, Jamaica is prone to hurricanes. It also lies within the earthquake zone. The annual rainfall averages 1980mm, but nationwide there are some considerable variations, with the east coast receiving considerably more rain than elsewhere on the island. Parts of the Blue Mountains receive an average of 7620mm a year. By contrast, the south coast sees little rain and in places is semi-barren. Jamaica is a year-round destination, though there are seasonal differences to consider. Weather-wise, temperature isn’t an important factor: winter is usually warm by day and mild to cool by night, and summer months are simply hot. Pack lightweight cottons and casual linens. Light woollens are advised for evenings when mosquitoes can make long sleeves more appealing than skimpy beachwear. Sunhats and waterproofs are handy all year round. With an area of 10,992 sq km (4,244 sq miles), Jamaica is the largest island of the Commonwealth Caribbean and the third largest of the Greater Antilles, after Cuba and Hispaniola. A largely mountainous terrain reaches 2,256m (7,402ft) at the Blue Mountain Peak in the east, descending westward in a series of ridges and forested ravines. Over 1,000km (621 miles) of coastline offers fine beaches in the north and west. At its greatest extent, Jamaica is 235km (146 miles) long with a width that varies between 35 and 82km (22 and 51 miles). The island is a quarter the size of Estonia, half the size of the Scottish Highlands, roughly the same size of the American state of Connecticut."
caribbean,martinique,"When he discovered Martinique in 1493, Christopher Columbus gushed that it was “the most beautiful country in the world”. Since then this island has lost little of the magic that so captivated the great explorer: it remains one of the most beautiful destinations you are likely to visit. Originally inhabited by Arawak and Carib Indians, who were swiftly eradicated by the French, the island has been hotly fought over. The British made numerous attempts to occupy Martinique during the 18th and 19th centuries, but it has remained defiantly French since 1635 (along with nearby Guadeloupe).  Tourism represents a major part of the local economy and each year hundreds of thousands of visitors come to enjoy Martinique's picturesque volcanic landscape, luscious rainforests and fine beaches, which are lined with sugar, palm, banana and pineapple plantations. An accommodating people, most Martinicans are of mixed ancestry, being the descendants of 17th century French settlers and slaves brought from Africa to work on the island's plantations. This French and Creole heritage is infused in local customs, food and languages, which is a joy for travellers. Do make sure you pack your dancing shoes. It’s impossible to escape zouk, the lively, two-beat local music that is similar to merengue in the Dominican Republic, but is unique to the French West Indies. Martinicans are very proud of their zouk, which will provide the soundtrack to your trip. If you need a bit of Dutch courage to get on the dance floor, you’re in luck, because Martinique produces fine rum. So exceptional is the liquor, in fact, that it was awarded the prestigious French label appellation d'origine controlee, which was previously only reserved for mainland produce. 1,100 sq km (425 sq miles). 396,364 (UN estimate 2016). 343.9 per sq km.

President Emmanuel Macron since 2017, represented by the prefect Jean-Christophe Bouvier since 2022. President of the Executive Council Serge Letchimy since 2021.","Prior to the discovery of Martinique by Columbus in 1493, the area was inhabited by Arawak and Carib Indians. There was no real European interest in the island until French colonies were established in 1635. Though the British made brief attempts to occupy the island during the 18th and 19th centuries, it has remained under French control ever since (along with Guadeloupe). Slavery was abolished in 1848 and, in the late 19th century, tens of thousands of immigrant workers arrived from India to replace the slave workforce on the plantations. Both Martinique and Guadeloupe were administered as parts of French Antilles. In 1946, rather than following a path to independence, the two islands were incorporated into the French nation with the status of Overseas Departments. There was little political evolution until 1974 when Martinique, along with Guadeloupe and French Guiana, was granted some local political and economic autonomy. This was increased in 1982 and 1983 following a package of decentralisation policies introduced by French President Mitterand. Most affairs, with the major exceptions of defence and security, are now generally under local control. The thrust of French government policy in the region is now to bolster links between its remaining possessions, Martinique and Guadeloupe, and other French Caribbean nations. Four parties dominate the political scene in Martinique: the Gaullist RPR-UDF (allied to the French party of the same name), the Parti Communiste Martiniquais and two island-based nationalist parties, the Parti Progressiste Martiniquais (PPM) and the Mouvement Indépendantiste Martiniquais (MIM, which now operates under the moniker Patriotes Martiniquais). Martinique's political centre of gravity is generally, but not always, to the left of the French mainstream. The PPM controls the Conseil Générale (elected into office in 2000), while the RPR is the majority party in the Conseil Regional (1998). The majority of the population is Roman Catholic. The atmosphere is generally relaxed and informal. Casual dress is acceptable everywhere, but formal attire is needed for dining out and nightclubs. The official language is French; a Creole patois is widely used.","Warm weather throughout the year, with the main rainy season occurring in the autumn. Showers can occur at other times of the year, but they are usually brief. Cooler in the upland areas. Lightweight, with waterproof wear advised for the rainy season. The French Overseas Department of Martinique, a volcanic and picturesque island, is the northernmost of the Windward Caribbean group. The island is noticeably more rocky than those of the Leeward group, with beaches (of fine black or white or peppered sand) surrounded by sugar, palm, banana and pineapple plantations."
caribbean,montserrat,"Montserrat is a quiet, laid-back island where you can hike, birdwatch, snorkel, or enjoy a couple of drinks over a game of dominoes. The tiny Caribbean island was dealt a devastating blow when the Soufrière Hills volcano erupted massively in 1995 and again in 1997. Almost half the island was rendered uninhabitable, including the capital, Plymouth, which today stands half-submerged in volcanic ash and mud. The effects were not limited to physical destruction. Montserrat's economy was severely damaged, and around two-thirds of the 12,000 population left the island. The volcano remains active and much of the island is still out of bounds, but this in itself is a draw for tourists looking for something beyond the usual Caribbean experience of beaches and luxury resorts. 102 sq km (39.4 sq miles). 5,154 (UN estimate 2016). 51.3 per sq km. Plymouth is still officially the capital, but was mostly destroyed by pyroclastic flows in August 1997. The government headquarters are currently in Brades. There are plans to turn Little Bay into the new capital. Self-governing British Overseas Territory. HM King Charles III since 2022, represented locally by Governor Sarah Tucker since 2022. Premier Easton Taylor-Farrell since 2019.","Arawak and Carib Indians were the first residents of Alliouagana, 'land of the prickly bush', until Christopher Columbus claimed it for Spain in 1493, whereupon he named the island Santa Maria de Montserrat. It was not until 1632 that the British colonised the island, which is still a British Overseas Territory. The actual settlers were mainly of Irish Catholic origin, who appreciated the presence of an ocean between them and Oliver Cromwell. Irish surnames among the present population reflect this history. Between 1871 and 1956 the island was administered as part of the Federal Colony of the Leeward Islands. At this point the federation was dissolved; since then Montserrat has been a British colony administered by a Governor appointed by the British government. For the most part, the major political issue since 1960 has been independence. While a significant minority has backed this option, it has failed to attract a majority owing to uncertainty about the island's economic future. The main reason is its vulnerability to the elements; Montserrat is located in the Caribbean hurricane zone. However, damage from tempests was nothing compared to that wrought by the eruption of a volcano in 1997. This rendered almost half the island uninhabitable, and much of the 12,000 population left the island. Many original inhabitants have returned to Montserrat, but the island has been left more dependent than ever on aid and support from the British government. The southern part of the island, which bore the brunt of the eruption, has been partially repopulated, but the overriding priority for the government has been to bring economic and social life back to the devastated island. This has been a difficult and gradual process, hampered by disagreements. Roman Catholic, Anglican, Methodist and other Christian denominations. Casual clothes are acceptable. Beachwear should be confined to the beach or poolside. The lifestyle is generally peaceful, combining many English influences with West Indian. The people are usually friendly and relaxed. All visitors are made welcome. English.","The climate is subtropical, tempered by trade winds. There is little climatic variation throughout the year making Montserrat a great year round destination. The heaviest rainfall occurs between July and November; however, the heavy cloudbursts serve to refresh the atmosphere and once they are over the sun reappears. Tropical lightweights are worn, with light woollens for cooler evenings. A light raincoat or an umbrella is useful. Montserrat is one of the Leeward Islands group in the Eastern Caribbean. It is a volcanic island with black sandy beaches and lush tropical vegetation. There are three main volcanic mountains on the island and Chances Peak is its highest point at 915m (3,002ft). The Soufrière group of hills houses the volcano which began erupting in July 1995 and to date is continuously active. The Great Alps Waterfall, previously one of the most spectacular sights in the West Indies, has been destroyed by the volcano."
caribbean,puerto-rico,"Think palm-fringed beaches, colourful colonial buildings and a harmony of Caribbean, Hispanic and American cultures, and you’ve got Puerto Rico in a nutshell. A coconut shell, of course. Add to this swathes of tropical rainforest, warm turquoise waters and year-round sunshine and you have all the hallmarks of a perfect holiday destination. Most visitors flock to Puerto Rico to bask on its pristine sands. From Rincón’s rip-roaring swells to the nearly deserted shores of Vieques where wild horses roam, there really is sand and surf for every type of beach bum. Puerto Rico also has three rare bioluminescent bays: glow-in-the-dark bodies of water that produce a nighttime lightshow for kayakers and boat tours. Inland, epic landscapes and cultural attractions abound. The central mountain range is riddled with limestone caves and rugged forest trails. El Yunque National Forest, by contrast, is a lush expanse of rainforest, with waterfalls and Taino petroglyphs. The Conservation Trust of Puerto Rico's various sites offer visitors a taste of the island’s colonial history, including Hacienda Buena Vista, an old coffee plantation, and Hacienda Esperanza, an old sugar plantation. Culturally, Puerto Rico integrates three “roots”: Taino (an indigenous group), Spanish and African. The country is in the Caribbean, but not wholly of it, influenced also by Latin America and the USA, with which it has a colonial relationship. The American influence is visible through ubiquitous US flags, shopping malls and baseball, the national sport. Historical Spanish influences are well preserved. Old San Juan is home to two UNESCO World Heritage sites, with blue cobblestone streets and pastel-painted colonial buildings. This blend of cultures makes for interesting music, food and festivals, as well as some quirks of daily life (the Spanish and English languages are fused resulting in some interesting names). Preserving cultural heritage is what Puerto Ricans do best, and it’s what draws visitors back again and again. That and the beaches, of course. 8,870 sq km (3,425 sq miles). 3,680,772 (UN estimate 2016). 405.7 per sq km. San Juan. Self-governing US Commonwealth Territory (incorporated). President Joe Biden since 2021. Governor Pedro Pierluisi since 2021.","Puerto Rico was first inhabited in around 3,000 BC. When Columbus landed in 1493 on his second voyage to the New World, the island’s inhabitants were the Tainos, Arawak people originating from South America. Claiming the territory on behalf of the Spanish Crown, Ponce de Leon governed Puerto Rico from 1508. Puerto Rico was eventually ceded to the USA in 1898 at the end of the Spanish-American War. In Guanica, on Puerto Rico's southern coast, you can see a monument to the spot where ‘invading’ US troops landed during the war. Puerto Ricans were granted US citizenship in 1917 and in 1952 the island became a self-governing Commonwealth in association with the USA. Although seen by many as a political compromise, in practice, this gives Puerto Ricans an American passport and makes them eligible for military draft but they do not pay US federal taxes and cannot vote in US elections. Their status remains one of Puerto Ricans most contentious issues. Of the main political parties, the Partido Popular Democrático (PPD) is broadly in favour of the existing Commonwealth status, while the Partido Nuevo Progresista (PNP) supports full state membership. A third party, Partido Independentista Puertorriqueño (PIP) supports independence. In December 1998, the third referendum in 30 years was held on the issue: voters were asked whether they wished Puerto Rico to become the 51st state of the USA, become independent, enter a compact of Free Association (similar to that which operates in a number of Pacific micro-territories) or retain the status quo. By a narrow majority, the vote for the status quo won. A further referendum in August 2012 resulted in a vote for US statehood. However, the country remains in limbo, chiefly because the US Congress makes the final decision when it comes to admitting new states and, despite heavy lobbying, it has yet to accept Puerto Rico as one of the United States of America. Did you know? •	The piña colada was invented in Puerto Rico (with the honour claimed by two San Juan bar men) and has been the national beverage since 1978. •	Zuleyka Rivera Mendoza, a former actress from Puerto Rico, was crowned Miss Universe in 2006, the island’s fifth winner of the title. •	Cockfighting, outlawed in most other countries, is hugely popular in Puerto Rico – it draws large crowds and is sometimes televised. •	The world’s largest single-lens telescope is on Puerto Rico, at the Arecibo Observatory, in the northwest of the island.

Handshaking is the customary form of greeting among acquaintances. Casual dress is acceptable, but shorts should not be worn in hotel dining rooms or casinos, where formal dress is required after 2000. Spanish and American manners and conventions exist side by side on the island. Some hotels require formal dress. Spanish and English are the official languages.","Unlike many islands in the Caribbean, any time is really the best time to visit Puerto Rico and enjoy its tropical climate. The rainy season is from April to November, but precipitation patterns and amounts vary considerably from one part of the island to the other. Even in the rainiest areas, showers are likely to be intense but brief. If you're travelling from San Juan to Ponce (or vice-versa), you'll notice an immediate difference once you reach the top of the mountain about halfway through your journey. The south tends to be drier than the north. In the mountainous region, you'll want a light jacket or sweater, as the higher elevation means cooler temperatures. 1 June to 30 November is hurricane season, though Puerto Rico is rarely affected by hurricanes. February is an excellent time to visit Puerto Rico; when temperatures are typically cold on the mainland USA, they're usually neither too hot nor too cool in la isla del encanto, the island of enchantment. Lightweight tropical clothes. Light rainwear required. Dress clothes for finer dining and nightclub visits. Bathing suits, of course, are de rigeur for those who plan to enjoy the water! A hat and sunglasses will help protect you from the sun's searing rays, and if you plan to snorkel or spend lots of time in the water, a long-sleeved shirt that repels UV rays is highly recommended. Puerto Rico is an island east of the Dominican Republic and west of the British Virgin Islands. The rougher, cooler Atlantic Ocean is on the north side of the island; the calmer, warmer Caribbean Sea is on the south side. It is the smallest island in the Greater Antilles and the largest island in the Lesser Antilles. Culebra, Mona and Vieques are among several smaller islands that are part of Puerto Rican territory. The waters surrounding the island are quite deep; the Puerto Rico trench is the deepest part of the Atlantic Ocean. The island is comparatively small, 8,959 sq km (3,459 sq miles), with a central mountain range reaching an altitude of 1,338m (4,390ft) at Cerro de Punta, and surrounded by low coastal plains. The island has remarkable geographic diversity for its size, with limestone formations in the interior, a desert in the southeastern part of the island, and the rainforest. Mangroves dominate the southern shore and are an important part of the island's ecosystem. San Juan, the capital, is on the northeast shore. Much of the island's natural forest has been cleared for agriculture, but the trees in the northeast corridor are protected as a national park. One of the hot-button environmental and political issues on the island is increasing development, particularly by the tourism industry with respect to hotel and resort construction. The island's nature conservancy, the Fideicomiso, has played a critical role in acquiring and protecting significant land and restoring properties for public visits and educational purposes. The other main towns are Aguadilla, Arecibo, Bayamón, Caguas, Carolina, Cayey, Fajardo, Guaynabo, Mayagüez and Ponce."
caribbean,french-overseas-possessions,"One of the last vestiges of the French colonial empire, you can hardly blame Paris for keeping hold of this slice of paradise. Floating in the Indian Ocean, east of Madagascar, Réunion serves up an enticing mix of Creole culture, exotic fauna and natural wonders. Administered directly from Paris (it also flies the tricolore and is part of the Eurozone), the island has a distinct cultural identity, which has resulted from 400 years as a remote outpost of empire. Its history is best absorbed wandering through the old heart of Saint-Denis, the island’s de facto capital. Edifices that would not look out of place in the French capital line streets and public spaces buzz with the sound of French, Creole, Cantonese and Tamil, among myriad other languages. English is almost never one of them. The beaches are a big draw, but Réunion’s flora and fauna is equally enticing. The island’s fresh water lakes, rivers and waterfalls support some 90 species of bird, while its coral reefs harbour an abundance of marine life. Whales are also regularly observed from the beaches between May and September. Away from the coast, much of the island’s forested and mountainous interior is protected and designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site. A variety of activities are available, from paragliding to rock climbing and hiking. Trekking paths lead to natural wonders such the 3,000m (10,000ft) extinct volcano Piton des Neiges (the highest point anywhere in the Indian Ocean), or the lunar landscapes around Piton de la Fournaise, one of the most active volcanoes in the world.

In the 1640s Réunion was occupied by the French, who claimed the land as their own and renamed it Île Bourbon. The island was initially used to exile mutineers, before the first settlers arrived in 1665. The island was renamed Réunion in the 18th century, during which time it became prosperous, along with nearby Mauritius, as it lay on the shipping routes carrying trade between Europe and Asia. Sugar plantations, worked by slaves imported from Africa, formed a major sector of the growing economy. The island was ruled as a French colony until 1946, except for a five-year period from 1810 when it was snatched by the British. It was granted the status of an Overseas Department of France, under which it is an integral part of the French State, which is represented on the island by a commissioner. Politics in recent years have been primarily concerned with internal autonomy: most people appear to favour an increase beyond the present level but very few support completely severing the historic link with France, particularly as the island is largely dependent economically on aid from the French government. Political parties on the island include adjuncts of the main French parties, the Gaullist Rassemblement pour la République (RPR); the centre-right Union pour la Démocratie Française (UDF) and the Parti Socialiste (PS), plus the Parti Communiste Réunionnais (PCR), and some smaller local parties. One of these, the right-wing France-Réunion-Avenir (literally France-Réunion-Future) has made little headway; another, the FreeDOM party, was a political phenomenon of the early 1990s, which evolved from a pirate television station. After the pirate broadcasters' leader, Camille Sudre, was banned from political activity, his wife Marguerite became president of the party. It has since become a permanent feature of the political landscape.

caribbean,saba,"Saba sits majestically at the peak of a submerged extinct volcano. As such, the island abounds with stunning vistas of dramatic cliff faces and spectacular rocky shorelines. With only one road ('The Road') and a population of less than 1,500, Saba is the most unspoilt island of the former Netherlands Antilles, and the superb preservation of the island's unique ecosystem has earned it the nickname of 'The Unspoiled Queen'. In fact, until 50 years ago, Saba was a secluded oasis, having neither an airport nor a sheltered harbour. There are four villages, which until recently were only connected by thousands of steps cut into the rock. A road now links the airport with the island's capital, The Bottom. The Bottom is situated 250m (820ft) above the ocean on a plateau surrounded by volcanic domes.

In 1632, a party of Englishmen was shipwrecked on the tiny island and found it uninhabited, although there were traces of Carib occupation. Permanent settlement by Europeans did not occur until the second half of the 17th century, when the Dutch were consolidating their Caribbean empire, based on Curaçao. The settlers founded an agricultural economy with sugar and indigo as the key crops. The decline in these markets forced the population to maintain their modest prosperity through fishing and embroidery which, together with low-key tourism, remain the major sources of income. The island changed hands 12 times between 1632 and 1816, when it was finally confirmed as a Dutch possession. As part of the Netherlands Antilles, Saba gained partial independence from The Netherlands in 1954. The issue of the Antilles' constitutional status never left the political agenda, however, and was the subject of a referendum on the three Windward Islands in 1994. All three voted to remain within the Antilles but Saba registered the largest majority of 91 per cent. The socialist Frente Obrero Liberashon (Workers' Liberation Front) won the largest number of seats in the 2002 general election, but was excluded from office by a four-party centre-right coalition led by the Partido Antia Restruktura (PAR, Party for the Restructured Antilles). The PAR, based on the island of Curaçao, dominated Antilles' politics since its formation a decade ago. After the dissolution of the Netherlands Antilles in 2010, Saba became a special municipality of The Netherlands and is under the direct administration of the European country. Saba adopted the U.S. dollar as its currency on 1 January 2011, replacing the Netherlands Antillian Guilder. Roman Catholic majority; also Anglican and Wesleyan.

caribbean,st-eustatius,"Popularly known as 'Statia', St Eustatius was a thriving port during the 17th and 18th centuries, becoming known throughout the Caribbean as 'The Golden Rock'. In fact, for a time, it was the busiest seaport in the world. Much-favoured as a tax-free haven, it grew to a population peak of around 30,000. Given St Eustatius' relative anonymity today, you might think 'how the mighty have fallen'. But any visit to the island will dash such foolishness from your mind. Bathed in Caribbean sunshine, with only one town, Oranjestad (not to be confused with the Aruban town of the same name), St Eustatius a sleepy, pretty haven from another time. Made up of cottages and waterfront houses, Oranjestad is deserving of a wander, but then it's essential to explore the island's rural hinterland and rugged volcanic hillsides. The decline of St Eustatius from the 19th century onwards – brought about, incidentally, by French conquest and the imposition of heavy taxes – has now halted. It's true that this is largely thanks to the influx of tourists. Like other countries in the region, St Eustatius became a special municipality of the Netherlands following the dissolution of Dutch Antilles in 2010. The foundations of the Dutch sea walls are now sunk beneath the clear waters of the bay today, though scuba divers and snorkelers can see many of the submerged ruins. Other attractions on the island include walking up The Quill, surfing off the northeast coast, and going on fishing trips. The nightlife is centred on the main hotels and restaurants, including dancing and local live bands, which may play one of the two different indigenous blends of reggae and calypso - 'Pim Pim' and 'Hippy'.

Within 100 years, it was the most important transhipment port in the New World, visited by as many as 3,000 ships a year, up to 200 of which could be anchored at one time. The island has changed hands 22 times since settlement, with the French, Spanish and British ever eager to wrest it from the Dutch. It was an important supply port for American settlers during the War of Independence; indeed, the Dutch administration of St Eustatius was the first state to recognise the United States of America, on 16 November 1776. This act provoked the British to send a fleet under Admiral Rodney to exact revenge and in 1781 the island was virtually laid bare by British guns. Rebuilt by the Dutch, it continued to be an important trading centre until the advent of larger ships sent it into obscurity. As part of the now disbanded Netherlands Antilles, St Eustatius (also known as Statia) gained partial independence from the Netherlands in 1954, but the issue of the Antilles' constitutional status never left the political agenda and although in 1994 the islands voted to retain the Netherlands Antilles the arrangement was not a happy one. Following more referendums a 2005 conference resolved to grant autonomy to Curaçao and St Maarten and integrate Bonaire, St Eustatius and Saba into the Netherlands as special municipalities.

caribbean,st-kitts-and-nevis,"Palm-fringed beaches? Check. Limpid lagoons? Check. Tropical rainforests? Check. The twin-island nation of St Kitts and Nevis embodies everything travellers have come to expect from the Caribbean, except, that is, for the crowds. Somehow, this vibrant island state has remained under the radar of mass tourism, carving out a niche as an alternative destination for those looking to avoid more mainstream Caribbean islands. The smallest sovereign state in the Americas, St Kitts and Nevis are compact and easy to navigate, which is just as well because the pace of life here is slow – and proudly so. St. Kitts is the larger and more developed of the two and is home to the laidback capital, Basseterre, a former colonial outpost renowned for its historical monuments, vibrant markets and lively beach life. Dominated by Mount Liamuiga, a dormant volcano carpeted with verdant rainforest, Kitts is also home to the defunct British fortress, Brimstone Hill, one of the best preserved citadels in the Americas and a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Remnants of the sugar cane industry, once the beating heart of the Kitts economy, remain; old sugar plantations have found new lives as bijous hotels and restaurants, while the island's narrow-gauge railway, once used to transport the cane, has become a popular attraction. And then there's Nevis. Fanned by trade winds and dominated by an active volcano, this island is the quieter of the two. The scenery remains relatively unchanged by progress; its undulating landscape punctuated by plantation-style hotels which offer lazy lunches and charming lodgings. Those looking for something more adventurous can pass the days hiking through forests, pedalling down mountain trails or surveying the island's coral reefs, which are popular with scuba divers and snorkelers. There is little competition for space on Nevis' powdery beaches, and, for the discerning gastronome, there are plenty of excellent restaurants to choose from. St Kitts and Nevis will, alas, not stay under the radar forever. The authorities are keen to boost tourism and those familiar with this corner of the Caribbean will be hoping they do it without diluting the islands' many charms. 261 sq km (101 sq miles).

These settlers named the islands Liamuiga (fertile island) and Oualie (land of beautiful waters) and lived here happily until the Europeans arrived. Christopher Columbus was the first European to sight the islands in 1493, naming them St Kitts and Nevis from the deck of his vessel. Europeans flirted with the islands throughout the following century – using them as little more than a reference point during voyages. But in 1623, the British, seeking a colony in the Lesser Antilles, landed on St Kitts. They established a port town at Old Road, the first British colony in the Caribbean, where they cultivated tobacco. Relations with the local Carib population, at that point, were affable. Two years later a bruised French fleet – fresh from a battle with the Spanish navy – limped into St Kitts. Feeling sorry for them, the British allowed their fellow Europeans to settle on the island, making St Kitts the first French colony in the Caribbean. The influx of foreigners bred hostility amongst the Caribs, who planned a raid on European settlements. However, the plan was foiled by the colonialists, who launched a pre-emptive attack, wiping out most of the indigenous population in a bloody event known as the Kalinago Genocide of 1626. The remaining Caribs were deported. The UK, France and, to a lesser extent, Spain then began squabbling over the islands. During the 18th century, the mood got serious. The British built the imposing Brimstone Hill fort to defend the islands from the French, who invaded Nevis in 1706, leaving its sugar industry in tatters. In 1824, Britain placed the nearby island of Anguilla under the administrative control of St Kitts and Nevis. At this point, the islands’ sugar industry, built largely on slave labour, was thriving once again and continued to prosper after Britain abolished slavery in 1834. In 1980 the strained three-island state of St Kitts, Nevis and Anguilla eventually broke down when Anguilla, seeking independence from its neighbours, secede from St Kitts and Nevis to become a British overseas territory. Three years later, in 1983, St Kitts and Nevis gained independence from the UK. Since then, the dominant issues for the nation have been the mothballing of the sugar industry and the relationship between the two islands – a 1998 referendum on independence was approved by 62% of Nevis voters, falling just short of the two-thirds majority needed to triggered secession from St. Kitts. Did you know? • At the turn of the 18th century, St. Kitts was the richest British colony per capita in the Caribbean, due largely to the sugar trade. • Sugar production in St. Kitts and Nevis lasted 365 years before ending in 2005. • Were Nevis to gain independence from St Kitts, it would be the world's smallest sovereign state after the Vatican.

The driest period is from January to April and there is increased rainfall in summer and towards the end of the year. The volume of rain varies according to altitude; rain showers can occur throughout the year. The average annual rainfall is about 125cm (50in) to 200cm (80in) with a wetter season from May to October. Like the other Leeward Islands, St Kitts lies in the track of violent tropical hurricanes which are most likely to develop between August and October. Tropical lightweights, with light rainwear advisable all year round. St Kitts (officially known as St Christopher) lies in the northern part of the Leeward Islands in the eastern Caribbean. The high central body of the island is made up of three groups of rugged volcanic peaks split by deep ravines. The vegetation on the central mountain range is rainforest, thinning higher up to dense bushy cover. From here, the island's volcanic crater, Mount Liamuiga, rises to almost 1,200m (4,000ft). The foothills, particularly to the north, form a gently rolling landscape of sugar-cane plantations and grassland, while uncultivated lowland slopes are covered with thick tropical woodland and exotic fruits such as papaya, mangoes, avocados, bananas and breadfruit. To the southeast of the island, a low-lying peninsula, on which there are many excellent beaches, stretches towards Nevis. Some 3km (2 miles) to the south and only minutes away by air or ferry across The Narrows channel is the smaller island of Nevis, which is almost circular in shape. The island is skirted by miles of silver-sand beaches, golden coconut groves and a calm, turquoise sea in which great brown pelicans dive for the rich harvest of fish. The central peak of the island, Nevis Peak, is 985m (3,232ft) high and its tip is usually capped with white clouds. The mountain is flanked on the north and south sides by two lesser mountains, Saddle Hill and Hurricane Hill, which once served as look-out posts for Nelson's fleet. Hurricane Hill on the north side commands a view of St Kitts and Barbuda. On the island's west side, massed rows of palm trees form a coconut forest. There are pleasant coral beaches on the island's north and west coasts."
caribbean,st-lucia,"Trade winds keep temperatures on the right side of sizzling in sunny St Lucia, where white sandy beaches, crystalline waters and luscious rainforests paint the quintessential picture of Caribbean island idyll. St Lucia is in the business of creating lasting first impressions: visitors to the island are greeted by the unforgettable sight of the Piton Mountains, which are fringed by coral reefs, sandy shores and swaying palms as they rise majestically from the rolling surf. While other Caribbean islands lay claim to equally beautiful beaches, St Lucia will tempt you out of the sun-lounger and into the ocean with its bountiful marine life and exquisite reefs, which are a playground for scuba divers and snorkelers. St Lucia’s waters are also prime for kite-boarding and windsurfing, thanks to the aforementioned trade winds.  It’s not all about the coast, though. A trip to the island’s interior presents the opportunity to hike through verdant mountains, zip-line over forest canopies and watch boiling sulphur springs bubble away atop a volcano, all in a day’s work. If you’ve still got the energy for a night out, there are regular shindigs in the north of the island. Friday nights get particularly lively.   Here visitors can experience the relaxed flavour of island life, as well as the unique mixture of West African, European and East Indian influences that infuse the local cuisine. St Lucia is also known for its folk music and world-famous Jazz & Arts Festival, which takes place every year amidst much fanfare.   The island carries a unique cultural heritage, having changed hands between Britain and France no fewer than 14 times. The British eventually lost control in 1979, and St Lucia gained its independence. Various cultural legacies linger, from the colonial-style plantations that dot the landscape, to the French-influenced patois spoken throughout the country. The result is a destination that will captivate visitors long after the emerald-green peaks of the Pitons have disappeared over the horizon. 616.3 sq km (238 sq miles). 186,383 (UN estimate 2016). 266 per sq km.

The Carib Indians could only keep the colonialists at bay for so long, though: between 1660 and 1814, the Old World skirmished over the island and its ownership of St Lucia switched hands no fewer than 14 times. In 1722 King George I granted the island to the Duke of Montagu, who sent a merchant sea captain with a fleet of seven ships to establish a settlement – he was promptly seen off by the French. Britain then occupied St Lucia during the Seven Years War, but returned it to France at the Treaty of Paris in 1763. A revolutionary tribunal was set up on the island after the French Revolution, all slaves were declared free and a guillotine was set up to execute Royalists, but it wasn’t long before Britain invaded the island and the tug of war resumed before being finally settled in 1814 at the end of the Napoleonic Wars. The British abolished slavery in 1836 and all slaves had to serve a four-year apprenticeship working for their former masters as they completed a transition to freedom. A measure of self-government was introduced in 1840 with universal suffrage from 1953, before St Lucia was granted full autonomy in 1979 as an independent state of the Commonwealth of Nations. HM The Queen remains the head of state and is represented on the island by the Governor-General, currently Dame Pearlette Louisy, who became the first woman to hold the position when she assumed office in 1997.

The driest period is from December to May and there is increased rainfall in summer and towards the end of the year (June to November). Regionally, there is some variation.  The beaches around the North (Castries, Gros Islet) whilst hot, receive cooling trade winds, whilst the rainforested interior of the island can get very hot and humid. St Lucia can also suffer from hurricanes; typically the hurrican season runs from June to November. In general, light breathable fabrics are best, along with beachwear. A light waterproof jacket may also come in handy during rain showers. Hikers should pack sensible footwear and warm clothes as temperatures drop at higher altitudes. St Lucia is the second-largest of the Windward Islands. It has some of the finest mountain scenery in the West Indies and is rich with tropical vegetation. For such a small island, 43km (27 miles) by 23km (14 miles), St Lucia has a great variety of plant and animal life. Orchids and exotic plants grow wild in the rainforests, and the roadsides are covered with many colourful tropical flowers. Indigenous wildlife includes a species of ground lizard unique to St Lucia. The Amazona versicolor parrot is another, though more elusive, inhabitant of the deep interior rainforest. The highest peak is Mount Gimie at 950m (3,117ft). Most spectacular are the twin peaks of Gros Piton and Petit Piton, ancient, volcanic forest-covered cones which rise out of the sea on the west coast. The mountains are intersected by short rivers which in some areas form broad fertile valleys. The island has excellent beaches and is surrounded by a clear, warm sea."

caribbean,st-vincent-and-the-grenadines,"Scattered across the Caribbean Sea like so many emeralds, St Vincent & the Grenadines is a glorious-looking archipelago. The country’s name makes it sound like an old soul band, and aptly there’s something timeless about the place. Lush mountain peaks, white sands, secluded coves, volcanic landscapes and spectacular coral reefs all go towards making this one of the region’s most diverse spots. For hikers, sailors and those who just fancy kicking back in wave-lapped sunshine for a week or two, it’s some proposition. The country, which found Hollywood fame when it was used as a setting for the Pirates of the Caribbean films, is made up of 32 islands and cays. St Vincent itself is by far the largest, and has a laid-back capital city, Kingstown, to show for it. Colonial architecture, botanical gardens and a fish market are among the attractions. The latter hints at the dishes that dominate the archipelago’s food scene – fresh seafood, usually washed down with a cold Hairoun beer, is a speciality. Elsewhere on St Vincent there’s some fantastic walking to be had, most notably the trail that leads up to La Soufrière volcano. The smaller islands that make up the Grenadines offer an even quieter pace of life. Among the most appealing spots are Bequia, which has good claim to that overused adage “the Caribbean as it used to be,” and Mustique, a long-established A-list bolthole that has welcomed the likes of Mick Jagger, Kate Moss and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. The best way to experience the outlying islands is to hop between them by boat, and the country as a whole has near-legendary status in the yachting community. The most obvious focal point on a sailing trip is the stupendously scenic Tobago Cays, which is made up of five uninhabited islands and offers excellent potential for divers and snorkelers. 389 sq km (150 sq miles). 109,644 (UN estimate 2016). 263.8 per sq km.

The island remained a Spanish possession until 1627, when it was granted to the British Lord Carlisle. However, the Caribs fought furiously to keep possession of it. In 1783, the Treaty of Versailles restored St Vincent to Britain, after the French had temporarily taken it. Carib resistance was finally crushed in 1795, after which the settlement of St Vincent proceeded on more conventional lines. During the late 19th and 20th centuries, St Vincent endured a series of natural disasters: in 1812, the first recorded eruption of the La Soufrière volcano, during which many lives were lost; in 1896, floods; two years later, a hurricane; and in 1902, the second eruption of La Soufrière, killing 2000 inhabitants. The next eruptions, neither of which caused loss of life, occurred in the 1970s. Soon after World War II, the right to vote was extended to the entire adult population, after decades of restriction. This was an essential preparatory move towards independence the key issue of the day. For small Caribbean islands like St Vincent & the Grenadines, a variety of proposals were studied during the 1960s, leading to St Vincent's adoption of Associate Statehood with the UK in 1969. Under this agreement the island was internally self-governing, while London looked after foreign and defence matters. It also gave St Vincent the right to declare full independence at any time, which it finally did in October 1979. The viability of St Vincent as a nation state has been the subject of constant debate ever since. In 1992, the New Democratic Party (NDP) administration of James Mitchell committed itself to the pursuit of a limited political and economic union with three other countries in the region St Lucia, Dominica and Grenada. The NDP remained in power for almost two decades. It was finally ousted in March 2001, when the United Labour Party won an absolute parliamentary majority. The new premier was ULP party leader Ralph Gonsalves, a former lawyer known to many as 'Comrade Ralph'. Under the new government, St. Vincent joined the Non-Aligned Movement in February 2003 and, later in the year, introduced anti-money laundering measures which ensured its removal from a 'blacklist' of countries which had failed to take sufficient measures to deal with the problem.

caribbean,trinidad-and-tobago,"Trinidad and Tobago: two very different islands, one mighty inviting destination. As the home of carnival, calypso and limbo dancing, not to mention Angostura Bitters, the country specialises in worldly contributions that have always been an assault on the senses. It’s raw in places, cosmopolitan in others and has a wondrous line-up of festivals and celebrations. What’s more, it punches way above its weight in the scenery stakes too. Diving? Hiking? Beaches? Waterfalls? Nightlife? Come on in. To talk about it as one nation, however, is accurate but misleading. Oil-rich big brother Trinidad plays home to more than 95% of the country’s population and has all the vigour this would suggest. Port of Spain, surrounded by verdant hills, is the main city. Here, bazaars throng beneath modern skyscrapers and mosques share the skyline with cathedrals, while the whole place bounces to the beat of Carnival, one of the planet’s great parties. It takes place annually on the Monday and Tuesday before Ash Wednesday – and more than meets the hype. Beyond the capital beckon volcanoes, a self-replenishing asphalt lake and magnificent bird reserves, meaning the island is as famed among twitchers as it is among party animals. Tiny Tobago, meanwhile, sitting 32km (20 miles) northeast of Trinidad, moves at an altogether gentler pace. No island was more fought over in the colonial era – it changed hands some 32 times, which says something about its appeal. It’s fertile, located outside the hurricane belt and is even said to be the inspiration behind Daniel Defoe’s Robinson Crusoe. Here, too, there are world-class attractions for nature lovers – it is home to the oldest protected rainforest in the Western Hemisphere – and you’ll also find a spread of modern beach resorts.

Over the ensuing centuries the islands became a battleground, fought over by the Spanish, Dutch, French and British, who left the fortifications to testify. Control switched hands some 30 times between the colonial powers as a lucrative sugar plantation industry run by slave labour developed. Abolition of slavery left a labour shortfall, which the British filled by encouraging Venezuelan farmers and forcing Indian labourers to settle. Trinidad was formally ceded to the British Crown under the Treaty of Amiens in 1802; Tobago came under British control in 1814. In 1857 came the discovery that would shape the country thereafter: oil, which countered the near collapse of the sugar and cocoa industries. In 1888, Tobago was amalgamated with Trinidad and the islands have been administered as a single entity ever since. By 1962, following various reforms, Trinidad and Tobago had achieved full independence. Eric Williams, for many still the father of the nation, took control of the country and served as prime minister from independence until his death in 1981. In 1976 the country became a republic within the Commonwealth and the economy boomed until a collapse in oil prices precipitated an attempt coup in 1990 when a 100-strong group of Islamic extremists occupied the Red House (the seat of Parliament) and the television station and held the country hostage for six days before surrendering.

caribbean,turks-and-caicos-islands,"Blessed with an abundance of natural riches – white powdery beaches, pellucid waters and some of the best reefs in the Caribbean – the Turks and Caicos Islands have a reputation for exclusivity. That may not be entirely fair, but this 40-island archipelago is certainly skewered towards the well heeled, with its credit card-melting hotels and private island resorts, where the rich and famous go to escape the hoi polloi. If your bank balance can’t stand the heat, there are affordable options to be found on the likes of Grand Turk, the largest island, where visitors can take in the delights of Governor’s Beach or head offshore to bathe on Little Sand Cay, a tiny island comprised of white sand and a handful of swaying palms. A visit to Salt Cay off Grand Turk offers a rare opportunity to view migrating humpback whales. Come on a full moon and you could also be treated to a natural light show courtesy of the bioluminescent glowworms, which inhabit the local waters. Swimming with stingrays off Gibbs Cay and kayaking through nearby salt marshes are just some of the other diversions. It’s not all about the coast, though. There are numerous parks, reserves and historic attractions inland, such as Cheshire Hall, a crumbling colonial plantation where guides regale visitors with historical anecdotes about the islands. Those seeking culture should head to Grand Turk, where you will find the archipelago’s capital, Cockburn Town, which is home to exquisite colonial era buildings, a smattering of museums and a handful of restaurants. A sophisticated, more upbeat vibe prevails on the island of Providenciales, which boasts lively beach bars, some excellent restaurants and the venerable Provo Golf & Country Club, one of the Caribbean’s finest. Those who fancy escaping the crowds can hop on a ferry to nearby North Caicos, an island of few people and many flamingoes. 948 sq km (366 sq miles). 34,904 (UN estimate 2016). 53 per sq km.

Legend has it that the islands were named after the indigenous, red-topped Turk’s-cap cactus, shaped like a Turkish fez, and the Lucayan phrase ‘caya hico’, meaning ‘string of islands’. During the mid-17th century, the Turks and Caicos Islands became a major centre for the salt industry. In fact, the archipelago provided the American mainland with salt well into the 19th century, with African slaves – many brought to the islands by Loyalists fleeing the War for Independence in the United States – being used as labour. During the 18th century, control of the islands changed hands several times among the French, Spanish and British, who eventually asserted dominance. Emancipation came in 1834 after a series of slave escapes to nearby Haiti. Following a period of near warfare between Bermuda and the Bahamas over control of the islands, the British Crown decisively shifted control to its Jamaica colony, which had aided the islands after the great hurricane of 1874. In 1962, having been a Jamaican dependency for some 75 years, the Turks & Caicos Islands became a separate British colony. That same year, the splashdown of US astronaut John Glenn off the coast of Grand Turk following his successful Earth orbit helped raise the global profile of the country. The islands held their first general election in 1976, and the decline in the salt industry following the devastation of Hurricane Donna in 1959 coincided with the first large-scale tourism development in the country, notably the opening of the Club Med resort in the early 1980s on Providenciales, which at the time had a population of less than 100 people. Political instability, including the conviction of a former chief minister on drug charges in the US, the adoption (and later, rewrite) of a new constitution, and corruption charges into the 2000s have not slowed the rapid expansion of tourism infrastructure (particularly in Providenciales) or the emergence of Turks & Caicos as a centre of offshore banking. The nation remains a British Overseas Territory.  Did you know? •	A great number of Canadian tourists visit the Turks and Caicos Islands and periodically the question of a union between Canada and the islands is raised by politicians. •	Hollywood stars Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner married on Parrot Cay in 2005. •	Club Med has a risqué adults-only resort on the Caicos island of Providenciales.

caribbean,us-virgin-islands,"The result of the US Virgin Islands' history and location is a unique blend of Danish heritage and American modernity. Add to that a dose of the relaxed and friendly attitude typical of the Caribbean, and you've pretty much got the measure of this territory. With miles of glistening beaches, first-class diving facilities and verdant tropical vegetation, there is more than enough to seduce even the pickiest of visitors. Don't let the name fool you too much. It's true that Americans favour the islands as a beautiful haven from the mainland – it's not called 'America's Paradise' for nothing – and those from the US don't even need a passport to visit. But this isn't just an American playground. The Danes' legacy is evident in Christiansted, on the largest island, St Croix, where historic sites include Fort Christiansværn (dating from 1774) and the Old Custom House. St Thomas too retains much of its Danish influence; in the capital, Charlotte Amalie, converted warehouses now house stylish boutiques. Apart from exploring the interesting history of these islands, which are situated in the Caribbean Sea (not far from the equally imaginatively named British Virgin Islands), there's terrific seafood to be sampled here, as well as water sports, and of course spectacular beaches. The nightlife is buzzing, with countless bars – beach bars, wine bars, lounge bars – as well as one enormous casino. For a little in the way of high culture, head to the Reichhold Center for the Arts. Those seeking unspoilt natural beauty should head to St John. With no airport, and two-thirds of the island's deep valleys set aside as a national park, this is an ideal retreat. An easy, unchallenging destination, the US Virgin Islands may not be the most culturally compelling choice, but the territory promises good fun, relaxing times and a sun-kissed reprieve from the rat race. 346 sq km (134 sq miles). 106,415 (UN estimate 2016). 299.3 per sq km.

First inhabited by Carib and Arawak Indians, in common with the rest of the Caribbean, they endured various waves of European invasion and settlement from the 1490s onwards, finally becoming part of the Danish West Indies. The US government purchased the islands in 1917 and they are now an unincorporated territory of the USA. A measure of self-government was introduced in 1954, along with the introduction of an elected Senate. The four main islands are Saint Croix, Saint John, Saint Thomas and Water Island, but the entire group is made up of some 50 separate islands and cays. The economy is driven largely by tourism and the manufacture of rum, although there is some agricultural activity on Saint Croix, the largest island. Politics on the islands follow the Republican-Democrat division of the USA itself and from the evidence of gubernatorial elections the political complexion of the islands was distinctly Republican from 1970 until 1987. This is when the governorship passed to the Democrats, who held the post until Roy Schneider, representing the Independent Citizens' Movement, was elected in 1994. Despite the fact that the Republicans did not even put up a candidate, Schneider's efforts to secure a second term failed and he was defeated by Democrat Charles Turnbull at the 1999 election. Turnbull went on to rule for the next eight years before fellow Democrat John De Jongh succeeded him in 2007. The incumbent Kenneth Mapp was elected in 2015. Although US President Gerald Ford authorised the United States Virgin Islands to organise a government that would pursue the territory's own constitution as far back as 1976 – and several attempts have been made to do so, most recently in 2010 when the US Congress rejected it – none has yet been successful. The 1993 referendum on self-determination attracted a turn out of just 31.4 per cent and the outcome – a vote in favour of the status quo – was declared void.

europe,albania,"Idyllic beaches, warm weather, rich history, spectacular mountain scenery and bargain prices; it sounds like an impossible wishlist for a European destination. Yet Albania fulfils all of these criteria and more. Over the past quarter of a century, this Balkan land has gradually emerged from its austere communist cocoon and savvy travellers have been taking note. The capital, Tirana, is a curious and cosmopolitan place. Its countless communist-era apartment blocks have been enlivened with licks of brash, bright paint, and in parts of the city these sit shoulder-to-shoulder with Ottoman and Italian architecture. It is haphazard and disorderly, but wildly alive, with the constant whir of traffic and cacophony of voices adding to the buzz. Leading down to the Greek border is Albania’s greatest asset: the Adriatic coastline (touted as the “Albanian Riviera”). It would be disingenuous to call it undiscovered; the beaches here draw significant sunbathing crowds during July and August. Even so, these heavenly stretches are fresh to foreign tourists - and among the best in the Med. If you can tear yourself off the towel, there are also interesting remnants of Greek, Ottoman and communist history to be explored in nearby towns. Of particular note are the now deteriorated and occasionally repurposed domed bunkers, paranoid follies ordered by the isolationist ex-ruler Enver Hoxha. Further inland, stony hiking trails weave among the lunar, sun-bleached mountains, where remote rural villages offer up a warm welcome to any inquisitive visitors. With unpaved, pothole-strewn roads and unreliable bus routes, just getting to the country’s interior can be an adventure in itself. But when the logistics of travel prove taxing, there’s always the dangling carrot of lovingly-prepared meals, tasty wine and ever-hospitable locals to spur you onward. With its winning combination of sandy beaches, engaging history and affordable prices, Albania's once-unsung charms are now being shouted from the garishly-coloured rooftops. 28,748 sq km (11,100 sq miles). 2,937,346 (UN estimate 2019). 102.17 per sq km. Tirana. Parliamentary republic. President Bajram Begaj since 2022. Prime Minister Edi Rama since 2013.","The roots of Albanian culture can be traced back to the ancient Illyrians. The Ardiaei tribe used Shkodra as their capital, and the present-day Albanian language is a rare surviving offshoot of the original Illyrian tongue. The Illyrians lived here first independently, and then alongside the Greeks, until the Romans arrived in the 2nd century BCE and assumed control for nearly four centuries until the empire’s division in 395 BCE. Next to take over the mantle of leadership were the Byzantines. During their reign, Albania was subject to relentless attacks from Visigoths, Huns, Slavs and Ostrogoths. A short-lived period of successful Albanian resistance between 1443 and 1468 helped stoke the fire of a burgeoning independence movement, though the country did eventually fall to the Ottomans who stuck around for more than four centuries. Following the establishment of the nationalist Prizren League and uprisings in 1910 and 1912, the Turks finally gave in to Albania’s demands for autonomy. Despite the proclamation of independence, things weren’t all fine and dandy. Establishing a coherent state proved difficult and WWI saw the country occupied by a succession of armies, among them the French, Italian and Austro-Hungarians. In 1941, soon-to-be-leader Enver Hoxha formed the Party of Labour of Albania. Hoxha and his party would keep Albania on a tight totalitarian leash during a restrictive reign that lasted from 1945 up until the early 1990s. During the early decades of Communist rule, Albania cosied up to China; the two states united by their common enemy, the Soviet Union. But when China severed the partnership in the late 1970s, insular Albania was left extremely isolated; comparisons are sometimes drawn between it and modern-day North Korea. In 1991, Albania finally shed its one-party system, becoming the last country of the former European communist countries to hold multi-party elections. The first year of democracy was turbulent; the country stabilised after the March 1992 elections, but the collapse of pyramid-banking schemes brought Albania to the brink of civil war in early 1997. Since then, Albania has gradually become more politically stable and economically prosperous. The 2005 parliamentary elections resulted in the first peaceful handover of power from one governing party to another. Albania has been a NATO member since 2009 and the country has been granted official candidate status for EU accession – meaning a coveted spot in the bloc seems tantalisingly close. Did you know? •	Upon the Mussolini-ordered invasion of Albania in 1939, the country’s first and last royal ruler, King Zog, fled his homeland and used gold looted from the Albanian treasury to foot his bill at London’s Ritz Hotel. •	Albania was the first country in the world to be declared an atheist state in 1967. •	During Communist rule, virtually the only Western films allowed to be shown in Albania were those featuring British comedian Sir Norman Wisdom. Hence, Wisdom became a popular cult figure in the country. Albania is an extremely secular society. According to a 2011 census the breakdown is 56.7% Muslim, 10.03% Catholic, 6.75% Orthodox (the autocephalous Albanian church), but at best these figures indicate a nominal attachment to each faith as both the Orthodox church as well as the Muslim community have voiced disagreement with these figures. Normal Albanian etiquette is for people to shake hands the first time they see each other every day, and then again when they part. Between friends, a kiss on both cheeks is exchanged by men as well as women. The usual way to indicate 'yes' is by moving the head horizontally from side to side. 'No' is usually signalled by a nod of the head. Albanians usually remove their shoes inside their homes or other people's houses. Smoking is widespread, and it is very unusual to find a non-smoking section in a restaurant, never mind a bar. However, smoking is not allowed on public transport, and this ban is almost always respected. Homosexuality is still a taboo, although not illegal and laws against discrimination being in place since 2010. Public displays of affection by LGBTQ+ couples are likely to be greeted with some hostility. The official language is Albanian, which 98% of the population speaks. Minority languages include Greek, Romani, Bulgarian and Serb. The most popular foreign languages spoken in Albania are Italian, dating back to when Italy controlled and protected Albania, and English, which is taught in many Albanian schools.","Albania has a Mediterranean climate, with hot, dry summers and mild, wet winters. Temperatures vary between the lowland coasts and the highlands, but generally everywhere is pleasant year-round. Bring an umbrella for winter travels, Albania’s rainiest season. In the lowlands, average winter temperatures hover around 7°C (44.6°F) and summers reach 24°C (75°F). More of the average annual 1,000-1,500mm of rainfall occurs in the north than the southern lowlands. The eastern Albanian highlands, due to greater altitude, have colder winters that can reach lows of -1°C (30°F) in January. This warms up by the peak of the summer to the mid-20°C range (mid 70°F). Clothing should suitable for the time of year and regions of the country to be visited, and also on the activities planned. For outdoor activities in the mountains, good waterproofs and warm layers should be carried at all times of year. On the coast in summer, long trousers and a light jacket will often be required in the evenings. Albania is bordered by Montenegro and Kosovo to the north, North Macedonia to the east and Greece to the southeast. Italy lies across the Adriatic to the west; at its narrowest point, close to where the Adriatic and Ionian Seas meet, Italy and Albania are only 72km (45 miles) apart, separated by the Strait of Otranto. Albania's highest point is the summit of Mt Korab (2,764m /9,068ft), on the border of North Macedonia. The largest lake in the Balkans, Lake Skadar, straddles the border between Albania and Montenegro; in the southwest, Lake Ohrid is shared with North Macedonia and the Prespa Lakes between Albania, North Macedonia and Greece."
europe,channel-islands,"Renowned for its wildflowers and quaint town of St. Anne, Alderney draws in city folk from France and England who are in search of some peace and quiet. Alderney's true appeal, however, extends beyond the picturesque flora and fauna. The island proudly has more than 30 social, sporting and cultural events a year and is a favoured destination for food lovers. Visitors will enjoy the best of both town life and the countryside. Walking routes cover rugged cliffs, while there are also sandy beaches and serene terrain. Wild flowers are a highlight for nature lovers, as are the sweeping green countryside and plentiful bird species. Meanwhile, St Anne's central church and picturesque streets offer a chance to see a storybook town in real life. Golfing and fishing are popular activities with visitors, as is cycling, hiking and sailing. But if you're in the mood to take it easy, Alderney is a lovely spot to simply lap up the fresh air and stunning views. Then there's the history. Alderney has some 5,000 years of it, seen in the dolmens and megaliths that still remain, as well as constructions dating back to the island's Norman takeover, which predated the Norman Conquest of Britain by more than a century. Accommodation ranges from converted stately homes, quaint guesthouses, or one of two stunning battlements, Fort Corblets and Fort Clonque. Camping is also popular, especially at the campsite on Saye Beach near windswept sand dunes. The third largest of the Channel Islands, Alderney is less than 6km long (3.5 miles), meaning you can get to grips with most of the island in a couple of days. Compared to the British mainland, the weather is generally pleasant, so you can spend the rest of your visit taking it easy, while trying the exceptional seafood in many traditional pubs and restaurants. 7.9 sq km (3.1 sq miles). 1,903 (2013). 237.9 per sq km.

Alderney became an island as waters rose during the Neolithic period and has been inhabited almost as long. There are traces of Roman occupation, but many of the outward signs of the island’s early human history were lost to extensive military construction in the 19th century and then again during the Nazi occupation in World War II – Alderney, along with its fellow Channel Islands being the only part of the British Commonwealth to be occupied by Germany. The connection to England dates from the Norman invasion of 1066 and although Normandy was incorporated into the Kingdom of France in 1204, Alderney remained loyal to the English Crown. In June 1940 the population was evacuated in the face of German occupation. Four concentration camps were built on Alderney housing mainly Russian and Polish prisoners of war and some Jewish slave labourers. Around 700 of the 6,000 inmates lost their lives before the Germans surrendered on 16 May 1945. The island’s hereditary governorship passed through several families until the last of the line, John le Mesurier (not to be confused with the English actor), resigned his patent to the Crown in 1825. Authority is now exercised by the parliamentary States of Alderney presided over by a President elected every four years. Did you know? • The last known native speaker of Auregnais, Alderney’s indigenous Norman dialect, probably died in 1960. • About a quarter of Alderney’s hedgehogs are descended from a single pair of blonde European hedgehogs released on the island in 1960. • The Nazi's built four concentration camps on Alderney, which largely housed prisoners of war.

Rainfall is mainly during the cooler months. The sea is 17°C (63°F) on average during the summer. Alderney is the most northerly of the Channel Islands, being 32km (20 miles) from Guernsey and just 12km (8 miles) off the coast of Normandy. The island rises 76 to 90m (250 to 296ft), with a mostly treeless flat plateau. At the south end steep cliffs fall into the sea and on the northern, eastern and southeastern sides, the land slopes gradually down to bays. The climate is milder than the mainland, with hot summers and drizzly winters."
europe,andorra,"Tucked away in the eastern Pyrenees, the tiny Principality of Andorra is a land of narrow valleys and mountainous landscapes that’s popular for skiing and trekking. Its pretty villages and hamlets – dotted along the main road that traverses the country – are filled with Romanesque churches and houses, built in a unique, local style and preserved through the country’s seclusion. Tracing its roots back to Ancient Greek times and Polybius’ mention of Iberian Andosinos, Andorra is not short of history. Tradition has it that Charlemagne rewarded the Andorrans for fending off the Moors by granting them a charter. It’s this peculiar independence, somehow enduring over the ages against successive threats, that has allowed Andorra’s beautiful architecture to remain so unspoiled. Liberal snowfalls and an undulating chunk of the Pyrenees make for great skiing conditions; those who love wintersports will find some of Europe's best pistes here. Politicians and royalty of Spain choose Andorra’s white peaks for their skiing holidays – and prices are certainly geared towards the well heeled. During milder spells, Andorra also offers excellent hiking conditions, with sweeping valleys, challenging ascents and charming vistas. The diminutive nation is administered from the capital city, Andorra la Vella, with two ‘Co-Princes’ as joint heads of states: the President of France and Bishop of Urgell in Catalonia, a tradition that dates back to the 13th century. The capital might not be to everybody's taste (think chock-a-block traffic barging between more shops than could possibly be required), but just a brief distance away lie some rural gems.  Villages such as Pal, a medieval settlement with an 11th century church, are well worth visiting. The Iron Route – by foot or bus – is also popular, taking visitors around the old town of Ordino. Andorra sees an incredible 10 million visitors a year, but wander off the beaten track and you’ll find many secluded Pyrenean spots to call your own. 467.8 sq km (180.6 sq miles). 69,165 (UN estimate 2016). 183.3 per sq km.

Prime Minister Xavier Espot Zamora since 2023.","One of the oldest nations in Europe, the tiny principality of Andorra was established by Charles the Great to act as a buffer state between modern-day France and Muslim Iberia. As a result of the Paretages (the territory’s first constitutional documents) of 1278 and 1288, control of the country was split between the Spanish Bishop of Urgell and a nominee appointed by the King of France (initially the Count de Foix), and subsequently by the French emperors and presidents. This unique power-sharing arrangement lasted until the late 20th century when the present constitution formally enshrined Andorra as a principality. Administration is in the hands of a general council with 28 members, four from each of the seven parishes, elected by universal suffrage. The council elects a president and a vice-president. Domestic politics are dominated by two parties: the Uniò Liberal (UL) and the Agrupament Nacional Democràtic (AND). Following a comprehensive victory in the 1997 poll, at which the UL took 18 of the 28 seats on the Conseil Général, a UL government took office under the leadership of Marc Forné Molné. Four years later, in 2001, the electorate returned the Molné government for a second term, again with an absolute majority. However, in 2005, Albert Pintat of the Liberal Party became prime minister, although not with an absolute majority. Molné lost his seat in the 2005 election but, in any case, was barred by the constitution from standing for a new term. In April 2009, the Social Democratic Party won the parliamentary election and in June 2009 Jaume Bartumeu Cassany assumed office as Head of Government. Did you know? • In 1934, a Lithuanian by the name of Boris Skossyreff pronounced himself to be the sovereign prince of Andorra and declared war on the Bishop of Urgell; Boris I was soon arrested and expelled. • Andorra remained neutral during World War II, though it did provide help to the French resistance. • Technically, though, Andorra was still at war with Germany since World War I, after its invite to the Treaty of Versailles was lost in the post.

europe,armenia,"It might be a small nation, but Armenia is big on character. Its 20th century history was troubled and relations with neighbouring Turkey are still fractious to put it mildly – although a visit to the country today is more likely to be dominated by its medieval treasures than its more recent past. The welcome is rarely anything less than warm – and usually accompanied by brandy – and the countryside itself is often breathtakingly beautiful. Tourist numbers are generally low, but you’ll find yourself wondering why. This is a country with serious historical legacy. Christianity arrived in AD 301 and Armenia proudly calls itself the world's oldest Christian nation. Religion still tends to play a large part in visitor itineraries – from the centuries-old monasteries that stud the hilly Lori region to the mists-of-time bibles at the wonderful Museum of Ancient Manuscripts – but Armenia is changing. Since the break-up of the Soviet Union, the country has re-embraced its traditions while moving on. Much of this progress is focused on the capital city of Yerevan. Loomed over on clear days by Mount Ararat across the border, it is the nation's hub of cultural activity and progressive thought, with a lively modern arts scene and plenty of large-scale redevelopment. Armenia has a large diaspora population – there are thousands of Armenian Americans – and a lot of wealth has been brought back into the country as a result. But the passions that underpin life here, from patriotism to religion, chess to cognac, aren’t the sort that cost millions. Cafe culture has been perfected and it's de rigueur to spend inordinate amounts of time lingering over a conversation. Armenian food is another treat – expect mounds of grilled meats and vegetables straight from the nearest garden. Around the country, travel highlights include the charming little town of Goris and the arty mountain settlement of Dilijan, but exploration anywhere in Armenia is likely to reap rewards. 29,743 sq km (11,484 sq miles). 3,026,048 (UN estimate 2016). 102.8 per sq km.

In 301, Armenia became the first country to adopt Christianity as its state religion and by the fifth century, the church had developed an alphabet, which is still used today. The incorporation of Armenia into the Turkish Seljuk Empire, in the 11th century, resulted in the first of many waves of emigration before the Egyptian Mamluk advance was followed by the Ottoman Turks occupation and a constant struggle with the Iranian Safavid dynasty until the beginning of the 19th century when the Russians moved in and took control. In 1915 the Turks massacred an estimated 1.25 million Armenians in the first act of genocide of the 20th century. After a brief spell of independence in the aftermath of World War I and following the Bolshevik victory in the Russian civil war Armenia was incorporated into the Transcaucasian Soviet Federated Republic and later became one of three distinct Soviet republics with Azerbaijan and Georgia. In the late 1980s, the Armenians were among the first groups in the Soviet Union to test the limits of glasnost with a series of demonstrations against industrial pollution and repression of the population of Nagorno-Karabakh. In December 1988, a massive double earthquake struck killing some 60,000 people and destroying nearly half a million buildings. The city of Spitak experienced near total destruction and in Leninakan, Armenia’s second city, some 80 per cent of buildings collapsed. The reconstruction process and the simmering Karabakh conflict strengthened the hand of the growing dissident movement leading to the election of Levon Ter-Petrossian, head of the Pan-Armenian National Movement, as President. Independence was formally declared on 23 September 1991 and the Karabakh conflict soon escalated into full-scale war until a Moscow-brokered ceasefire took effect in May 1994. Although there are still many obstacles, Armenia and Azerbaijan have found sufficient issues of common interest to establish a reasonable working relationship, but diplomatic relations between Turkey were severed in 1992 and remain so. However, Armenia has maintained solid ties with Russia and Iran, as well as the United Statesand the European Union. Did you know? In the wake of the 1988 earthquake, the British music industry launched Rock Aid Armenia to raise money through the release of the album Earthquake and three singles – covers of What’s Going On, Smoke on the Water and Led Zeppelin’s Rock and Roll. The National Art Gallery in the capital Yerevan has more than 16,000 works, some dating back to the Middle Ages. The apricot is the national fruit of Armenia. 94% Armenian Apostolic Church, with Catholic and Protestant communities and a Russian Orthodox minority. Armenia is the oldest Christian nation in the world, its conversion dating from the year AD 301. Almost all entertaining takes place in private homes, and guests may find themselves subjected to overwhelming hospitality and generosity, as well as being expected to eat enormously and participate in endless toasts. Visitors invited to an Armenian's home should arrive bearing some kind of small gift, such as flowers and alcohol (preferably imported) or chocolates. Handshaking is the normal form of greeting. Business cards are invariably exchanged at any kind of official meeting and not infrequently on first meeting people socially as well.Conversation tends to be highly politicised, and guests may be well advised to avoid expressing strong opinions. Homosexuality is now decriminalised but is still an unacceptable lifestyle for many Armenians. Women tend to be less retiring than in nearby Muslim countries, and can usually dress in normal western-style clothing (especially in the capital), although female visitors may wish to avoid wearing short skirts and shorts. Photography: Refrain from photographing sites such as military bases equipment and installations. Also be aware of cultural sensitivities when photographing churches and other religious sites. Armenian. Russian is usually understood, but rarely used; Kurdish is sometimes used in broadcasting as 56,000 Kurds inhabit Armenia.","Armenia is mostly mountainous (more than 90% of the territory is over 900m/2,286ft above sea level), so expect a dry highland climate. Springs are short with mild temperatures. Temperatures range from 7°C (45°F) to 19°C (66°F) at the capital Yerevan in April. Rains are scarce, but they do fall in springs. Summers are dry with plenty of sunshine. In Yerevan, temperatures hover around 33°C (91°F) in August. But in the north, temperatures are cooler and they can fall sharply at night too. Autumns are long and beautiful, with leaves turning gold and red. Winters are extremely cold, bleak with heavy snow. Temperatures often dip below 0°C (32°F) May to June and September to October are good times to visit Yerevan, as the weather is warm but mild. If you are travelling to Lake Sevan, June to September are your best bet. In Yerevan, you can wear light clothes in summers and autumns, with a light jacket for the evenings. But do bring very warm clothes for springs and winters. Armenia lies on the southern slopes of the Armenian Mountains in the Lesser Caucasus and is bordered by Georgia, Turkey, Azerbaijan and Iran. Its highest peak is Mount Aragats, 4,090m (13,415ft), and even its deepest valleys lie 450 to 700m (1,200 to 1,870ft) above sea level. Its biggest lake is Lake Sevan in the east."
europe,austria,"Despite its small size, Austria has a long-established international reputation, which is why most visitors arrive with heads full of Habsburg, Mozart and Alpine visions. Some expectations are delightfully met – the mountain scenery is breathtakingly real, there are the omnipresent fingerprints of the old empire in Vienna, and home-grown musical icons Mozart, Schubert and Strauss are championed everywhere – but Austria also has a few surprises up its sleeve in the form of contemporary art, cutting-edge architecture and innovative cuisine. Austria is frequently cited as one of the best places to live in Europe, and it is not difficult to see why. Remarkably safe and clean, it offers plenty of affordable culture, natural beauty and elegant Baroque and neoclassical architecture, as well as an efficient public transport system. It’s also surprisingly varied. You can hurtle down a black run in the skiing paradises of Kitzbühel and St Anton, or cosy up with a hot drink in one of Vienna’s famous coffee houses. You can skate across icy lakes in winter or seek out wildflower meadows on summertime hikes. You can wonder at the intricate church interiors and the ostentatious opulence of the old Habsburg palaces, or indulge in a more low-key aspect of Mitteleuropa culture over a steaming goulash in a rustic country inn. Or you can ride a horse through pretty wooded tracts, get an eyeful of Rubens, Raphael and Rembrandt, and marvel at Hundertwasser House in Vienna – a fantastical housing complex characterised by its vivid patterns and mismatched colours. Don’t try to squeeze it all in though. More than anything, Austria is a place to recline, relax and relish. Its natural beauty is the result of many millennia of natural activity and its grand art, architecture and culture was painstakingly created by many hands over many centuries. These aren’t sights to be hurriedly ticked off a list; allow yourself plenty of time to luxuriate. 83,871 sq km (32,382 sq miles). 8,741,072 (UN estimated statistic 2017) 106 per sq km.

Perhaps the most influential of its rulers, however, was the noble Habsburg family, which used Austria as the cornerstone of their empire for an astounding six centuries. The first of many emperors from the house came to power in 1273, and by the 16th century, the Habsburgs’ holdings had expanded dramatically across continental Europe both through military conquests and marriages. In the wake of the French Revolution in the late-18th century, a creeping nationalism spread among the people of Europe and the Holy Roman Empire was dissolved. Despite this new drive for independence among some of the empire’s ethnic groups, the Habsburgs managed to hold onto power. In 1867, the dual monarchy of Austro-Hungary was created in an effort to avoid the secession of an increasingly dissatisfied Hungary. This meant that the Habsburgs agreed to share power with the Hungarian government, divvying up the territory of the old Austrian Empire between them. Though Austria and Hungary was still officially one unit bound by the same ruling emperor, in reality, they had begun to go down increasingly divergent paths. The Habsburgs’ 640-year reign was finally ended by WWI. Even before the conflict was officially over, various groups began to declare independence and in 1918, the emperor abdicated. WWII saw Hitler invade and occupy Austria, persecuting the country's Jewish community. Post Holocaust, Austria's Jewish community rebuilt itself, but to this day the Jewish population remains much smaller than before WWII. After Austria's liberation by the Allies in 1944, foundations were laid for the Second Republic, which was formally established in 1955. Upon becoming an independent nation, the Austrian parliament declared permanent neutrality and, soon after, joined the UN. In 1995, Austria entered into the European Union, and also signed the Schengen Agreement, before adopting the Euro in 1999. Did you know? • Vienna is home to the oldest zoo in the western world, the Tiergarten Schönbrunn, which began as a royal menagerie for Holy Roman Emperor Francis I in 1752. • Because of its permanent neutrality, Austria is not a member of NATO. • Vienna is home to more dead people than living; there are an estimated three million plus buried in the city’s Central Cemetery, though the living population only numbers around 1.7 million. • Austria boasts some strange place names including a town called Egg and a village called Fucking, which has been plagued by spates of signage theft. Approximately 64% of the population is Roman Catholic. As of January 2011, 64.1% of the population identified as Catholic. The most recent Church diocese figures indicated that almost 59% of Austrians attend the Catholic Church. Austrians tend to be quite formal in both their social and business dealings. They do not use first names when being introduced, but after the initial meeting first names are often used. Handshaking is customary when saying hello and goodbye. It is considered impolite to enter a restaurant or shop without saying Guten Tag (good day) or, more usually, Grüss Gott (common greeting which literally means 'greet God'); similarly, to leave without saying Auf Wiedersehen (goodbye) can cause offence. If invited out to dinner, flowers should be brought for the hostess. The Church enjoys a high and respected position in Austrian society, which should be kept in mind.   German is the official language. Regional dialects are pronounced and within the different regions of the country one will encounter marked variations from Hochdeutsch, i.e. standard German. There are Croatian and Slovene-speaking minorities in the Burgenland and southern Carinthia respectively.","The best time to visit Austria is June to September for those seeking sunshine and low rainfall, whilst November to March are ideal for those seeking winter sports. European clothes according to season. Alpine wear for mountain resorts. Mountainous Austria is a landlocked country at the heart of Europe, bordered by Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Germany, the Czech Republic, the Slovak Republic, Hungary, Slovenia and Italy. The diverse landscape can be divided into five sections: the Eastern Alps (62.8%), the Alpine and Carpathian Foothills (11.3%), the Pannonian Lowlands (11.3%), the Vienna Basin (4.4%) and the Granite and Gneiss Highlands or Bohemian Massif (10.1%). Austria's highest mountain is Grossglockner (3,798m/12,465ft) found in the Alps' Hohe Tauern range, and, on its way from the Black Forest in southern Germany to the Black Sea, the winding River Danube flows for approximately 360km (220 miles) through the country. Nearly half of Austria is covered with forests, with the lower regions particularly densely wooded. Fir predominates above 488m (1,600ft), and gives way to larch and stone-pine beyond 1,219m (4,000ft); the Alpine foothills consist predominantly of arable land and grassland (above 610m/2,000ft); the Pannonian region is characterised by scrub and heathland."
europe,portugal,"For more than 500 years, the Azores, an archipelago of nine widely dispersed islands floating in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean, have remained almost completely unspoiled and largely unvisited, mainly on account of their remoteness. Volcanic in origin, these dramatic islands are pitted with deep craters, filled with shimmering lakes and covered with lush vegetation. Geysers and health-giving sulphur springs abound. For outdoorsy types, they are a joy to discover. In contrast to the Azores Islands’ natural beauty are the large tracts of arable farmland, which are peppered with tiny settlements of whitewashed houses. Here you will see gently sloping hillsides planted with vineyards and fruit trees that are tended to by the archipelago’s hardy inhabitants. Coastlines in the Azores tend to be rugged and somewhat forbidding – this is not exactly a beach destination – but there are plenty of bays and rocky inlets for swimming and sunbathing. Watersports are widely available, with a particular emphasis on scuba-diving, whale watching and yachting. The Azores Islands are, sadly, a secret no more. Improved air links with Portugal, which claims sovereignty over the archipelago, and the rest of Europe are bringing more adventure-seeking tourists to the islands. Not that an increase in visitor numbers will diminish the charms of this destination, whose natural wonders tempt many back for a return trip. 2,333 sq km (900 sq miles). 245,766 (INE value 2015). 105.3 per sq km.

Humidity is reasonably high and the wettest months are October to March. Mid-season clothes are best; the temperatures are mild at all times of the year. The Azores are a widely separated group of nine islands in the Atlantic, due west of mainland Portugal. The islands are Corvo, Faial, Flores, Graciosa, Pico, Santa Maria, São Jorge, São Miguel and Terceira. The islands are mountainous in the interior and forested, leading down to long beaches and fishing harbours. There are several hot springs and spas."
europe,spain,"Bathed in sunshine and skirted by platinum sands, the Balearic Islands are one of Europe’s prime island getaways. Floating off the coast of mainland Spain, this Mediterranean archipelago is awash with leafy terraces, crumbling heritage sites, secluded coves and poetic hills. The islands of Mallorca, Menorca, Ibiza and Formentera account for the vast majority of tourism to the region. The largest island, Mallorca, has its fair share package tourists but now also caters for an upscale crowd as well. The resort of Magaluf is a byword for neon-blazed, boozed-up Brits behaving shamefully. Recently, though, the island has been improving its image: rundown resorts are being replaced with modern facilities and stricter policing means a crackdown on drunkenness. Meanwhile, its capital, Palma, has grown into one of Spain's most beguiling small cities. Hedonistic Ibiza has long held an illustrious club scene that’s concentrated around the charming hippy-chic capital of Ibiza Town, the high-rise canyons of San António, and across Playa d'en Bossa. But away from the super clubs and skimpily covered ravers, Ibiza remains remarkably rural and the island’s former allure is far from absent. In its serene centre, olive groves flourish in rich red soil, almond trees bloom white and its northern beaches can be all but deserted. Both Ibiza and Mallorca offer exceptional beaches, but it’s Menorca that holds the aces for picture-postcard coves. Visitors that follow the island’s fringe path, Cami de Cavalls, are spoilt with shallow bays, crystal seas, craggy inlets and silent sandy shores. Charming too are Menorca’s towns. The capital, Mahon, is all steep streets and Georgian architecture, while Ciutadella’s charisma is in its old-town tranquility. As Balearic tourism soared, the island of Formentera, like Menorca, stayed grounded, and its efforts to conserve the coast and rubberstamp only low-rise developments has resulted in a quiet the other isles cannot rival. Total: 5,014 sq km (1,935 sq miles). 1.1 million (2016). 220.3 per sq km. Palma de Mallorca.","Today, the Balearic archipelago forms an autonomous province of Spain, but it has a chequered history with a number of different rulers. The earliest inhabitants are largely the stuff of legend – they may have been shipwrecked Boeotian mariners or a colony of Rhodes acquired after the Trojan War. The Ancients knew the two largest islands – Majorca and Minorca – as the Gymnesians and their people fought as mercenaries for both the Carthiginians and Romans. The Phoenicians occupied the islands, but after the fall of Carthage they were largely self-sufficient until the Romans invaded on the pretext of hounding out Mediterranean pirates. In fairly rapid succession from about AD461 islands fell to Vandals, the Byzantine Empire and the Umayyad Caliphate, enjoying varying degrees of independence. Swedish Viking King Björn Ironside sacked the Gymnesians and the smaller Pityuses – Ibiza and Formentera – in raids between 859 and 862 before the Emirate of Córdoba took control only to lose power and by 1050 the independent Taifa of Mallorca had been declared. For 250 years the islands were fought over by crusaders from Spain, France and Italy and the Muslim states of North Africa. Then various Christian kings and counts tussled for control of the islands, which by the first half of the 16th century were, despite frequent raids by Barbary pirates, under Charles V who ruled both the Spanish and Holy Roman empires. For most of the 18th century Minorca was a British dependency, although both Spain and France had ruled it at times before it was finally returned to Spain in 1802 under the Treaty of Amiens. Early in the Spanish Civil War, Republican forces attempted to drive the Nationalists out of the Balearics after Majorca, Ibiza and Formentera declared for Franco's Nationalists. The initial success of the Majorca Landings was reversed when Mussolini dispatched a strong contingent of Italian forces backed with superior air power and drove the Republicans into the sea. Majorca was annexed and occupied for the duration by Italy and its planes flew air raids against Republican targets on the mainland. At the end of the civil war, in February 1939 the British government agreed to arrange the surrender of Minorca to the Nationalists after it was informed Italian troops would leave the Balearics and HMS Devonshire brought 450 refugees to Marseilles. Today, the President of the Balearics – since 2015 Francina Armengol – is the head of government sitting in the islands' capital Palma. Did you know? • Tennis stars Carlos Moyá and Rafa Nadal are both from Majorca. • During the Napoleonic Wars 9000 French prisoners were sent to the islet of Cabrera – only 3600 survived. • S'Esplalmador is the site of a famous mud bath.","The islands enjoy a temperate, Mediterranean climate. The maximum temperatures are not excessive, even in high summer, owing to the cooling influence of the sea. The climate during the winter is generally mild and dry with occasional showers. Lightweight cottons for much of the year with shower protection and warmer wear in winter. The landscape of these islands is characterised by woodlands, almond trees, fertile plains and often dramatic coastlines with sandy coves separated by craggy cliffs. Mallorca has the most varied landscape featuring mountains and valleys, rocky coves and sandy beaches. The main geographical feature is the Sierra del Norte, a mountain range running along the northern coast. The island is covered with lush pine forest, and with olive and almond trees, which blanket the countryside with blossoms in springtime. Menorca is less impressive, though the two main towns, Mahón and Ciutadella, sited at either end of the island, sit above deep inlets forming natural harbours. There are many bays and cove beaches on the island. Ibiza has a rugged coastline with many fruit orchards and woods."
europe,belarus,"A country whose landscape is still engulfed by the memories of its Soviet past, Belarus is emerging as a trendy Eastern European hotspot - with the country slowly shedding its Communist reputation to become a budding and modern tourist destination. Unlike many of its neighbours who chose to become part of the European Union after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, consumerism is notably absent in Belarus – and those who visit are treated to a multifaceted destination rich in history, brimming with culture and populated by warm and generous inhabitants. And though its popularity is growing, Belarus' appeal might well be in its isolation. Indeed this is one of the few remaining places where you can still see what life was like during the days of communism. Largely untouched, Belarus offers an abundance of Soviet iconography, particularly in the big cities, allowing anyone with an imagination to visualise how things once were. The main destination is the capital, Minsk, defined by clean streets and neoclassical Stalinist architecture and where a cosmopolitan vibe sits alongside intense national pride. A veritable survivor, Minsk is a city whose character is almost tangible - having time and time again throughout its tumultuous history, refused to say 'die'. Brest is another city of interest. Nestled on the Polish border, Brest is possessed of charm and an abundance of history, also possibly the most Western of all the Belarusian cities. Outside of the cities, travellers will discover wide plains, picturesque villages, ancient castles, monasteries and dense forests, not to mention thousands of lakes. National parks protect some of the continent's largest marshlands, as well as some of Europe's oldest untouched woodlands, including Bialowieza Forest, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The countryside also offers the chance to see some of the last remaining collective farms in action. While Belarus may still represent a corner of Eastern Europe that's still developing in the wake of some difficult times, travellers who give this destination the time it deserves will reap the rewards and are sure to enjoy a colourful, compelling country. 207,595 sq km (80,153 sq miles). 9,508,000 (2017). 45.8 per sq km. Minsk. Republic. President Alexander Lukashenko since 1994. Prime Minister Roman Golovchenko since 2020.","The territory now known as Belarus emerged during the 9th to 12th centuries, having been colonized by the Slavs. Known as 'Kievan Rus', this territory was broken up in the 13th century following the expansion of Lithuania and then Poland and became what was 'Rzecz Pospolita'. From the mid 16th to late 18th centuries this territory experienced a tumultuous geopolitical struggle, being drawn into two separate wars with Russia and countries within Europe. In 1772 the western part of Belarus became a part of the Russian empire, with attempts at Russification and suppression of Belarusian national identity following soon after. Belarus remained a Russian territory throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries. During this period a blossoming of nationalism was seen and the economy improved as a result of industrialisation, and while a brief period of independence existed when the Belarusian People's Republic declared independence on March 1918, it was short-lived as the Red Army soon took control after the 1917 Russian Revolution - by January 1, 1919, the Belarusian Soviet Socialist Republic was created. In 1922 Belarus became a part of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, and remained so until WWII when German occupied Belarus in September 1941. The war saw even more suffering in Belarus as it found itself on the front line and was the location for many battles and the country became a Soviet stronghold once again in 1945. In April 1986, the Chernobyl nuclear disaster left a quarter of Belarus contaminated, the effects of which are still being felt to this day. Independence was claimed in 1991, and on 19 September 1991 the state was renamed the Republic of Belarus. The dissolution of the Soviet Union was announced shortly afterwards and Belarus introduced a new constitution in 1994. Since then, Alexander Lukashenko has ruled Belarus with an authoritarian iron fist, earning it the dubious honour of being widely viewed as Europe's last dictatorship. Did you know? • The national dish is draniki, potato pancakes made with flour and egg, topped with savoury or sweet condiments. • Pioneering modernist artist Marc Chagall was born in Belarus in 1887. • Belovezhskaya Pushcha is said to be the largest ancient forest in Europe. Belarus' religious landscape is dominated by Christians, primarily adherents of the Orthodox faith estimated to be around 50%. Around 7% of people are Roman Catholic, while Jewish and Muslim communities are much smaller. 40% of Belarusian nationals are said to be irreligious (atheist or agnostic). If meeting a stranger, shaking hands is the usual form of greeting. Hospitality is part of the tradition and people are welcoming and friendly, although Belarusians are also known for their brusqueness. If you are invited to someone's house, be sure to bring a small token as a gift. The same goes for power lunches - company gifts are well-received. Avoid taking photographs of military or government installations. Belarus is quite a conservative society, and homosexuality and homosexual activity was only decriminalised in 1994 - while not illegal, it is kept very low-key so as not to invite unwanted attention. The official languages are Belarusian and Russian. Other languages spoken in the country include Ukrainian and Polish.","Belarus enjoys a seasonal, continental climate with long, cold winters and warm, temperate summers. It experiences huge temperature fluctuations throughout the year, with the extremes of each season ensuring that Belarus isn't a typical year-round destination for tourists. The best time to visit is during the warmer months from May to September when the days are longest and the weather is mild. In July and August temperatures can reach highs of 25°C (77°F) although the average is 18°C (64°F). Summer is the perfect time to enjoy the Belarusian countryside and forage in the forests for wild berries. Winter starts in December and finishes in February, with temperatures hitting lows of -4°C (24.8°F) on average. In Eastern parts of the country the snow lasts around a month longer, so winter often lasting four months rather than the usual three. Once spring arrives and the 'thaw' begins, temperatures increase rapidly, and while it's uncommon, April can creep into the mid 20's°C (70's°F), so travelling in spring is also a viable option for tourists looking to save some money and enjoy Belarus at an off-peak time of year. Rain is also common in Belarus, with between 5 and 7 days of precipitation on average per month – the volume of this can fluctuate, with Belarus receiving 600-700mm of rainfall annually. Minsk, the capital, is situated in the heart of Belarus and experiences both the heat of summer and the cold of winter. July and August are peak season for Minsk in terms of weather, with average temperatures of 26°C (79°F) throughout the days in August and lows of 15°C (60°F) during August nights. The humidity level in summer is much higher in Minsk, so the chance of precipitation is also increased. Brest is centrally located and experiences similar weather to Minsk. With the August average reaching a balmy 27°C (81°F) in the day and 15°C (60°F) at night, the climate is comparable to the capital if not slightly warmer. Brest is more humid than its Eastern counterpart however, and rain is more likely. The peak time to visit Brest is in the heart of summer during July, so bear this in mind when arranging travel. In the winter you'll need to account for cold temperatures, so wearing medium to heavyweight clothing is advisable. Jeans, knits and heavy coats, as well as good boots are a minimum requirement. In the summer, depending on whereabouts you’re visiting, thinner cottons, linens, shorts and t-shirts will be fine. Waterproofs are advisable throughout the year due to the prevalence of rain. Bordered by Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Ukraine and the Russian Federation, Belarus is a landlocked, relatively flat country, crisscrossed by thousands of streams and major rivers such as the Dnieper. Its landscape is characterised by rich forests, which make up approximately 40% of the country, as well as uplands and lowlands created by glacial movements during the last Ice Age. These are responsible for the Belarusian ridge, which runs diagonally across the country from its mid-west to north-east. Straddling the border between Belarus and Poland is Białowieża Forest, one of the last stretches of Europe's primeval forests and home to approximately 800 bison. The Palyessye plain, a swampy lowland in the southwest of Belarus was severely affected by the Chernobyl disaster and much of the area is off-limits as it is now part of the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone."
europe,belgium,"The “boring” tag is laughable – Belgium, pretty and creative, is one of Europe’s most underrated travel destinations. Beer, chocolate and moules-frites might be the starting points for many first-time visitors, but while you’ll eat and drink well, the country’s other selling points are no less weighty. Medieval cities like Brussels, Bruges, Antwerp and Ghent play home to some stunning architecture, while a military legacy that covers everything from Waterloo to WWII holds its own interest. It’s compact, easy to travel around and boasts no fewer than 60 UNESCO World Heritage Sites. On top of that it hosts riotous festivals like they’re going out of fashion and has a world-class arts heritage, to boot. What Belgium isn’t, however, is straightforward. Divided into three regions − Flanders (the predominantly Dutch-speaking north), Wallonia (the predominantly French-speaking south) and the capital region of Brussels – it’s still very much split down linguistic lines. Even Belgians themselves will often refer to their homeland as an “artificial country.” In many ways, this only makes the place more fascinating. Flanders is filled with museums and medieval architecture, its countryside studded with white-washed hamlets and paved with miles and miles of cycling paths. Its North Sea coastline offers opportunities to try land boarding or kitesurfing. Wallonia, meanwhile, follows a slower pace. Steeped in folklore, its main towns have a faded French elegance and are ideal jumping-off points for exploring the rolling hills of the Ardennes. In both halves of the country, there are some genuinely beautiful landscapes. Brussels itself is a blend of Art Nouveau mansions and gleaming skyscrapers, art galleries and flea markets, “fritkot” chip stands and Michelin-starred restaurants. Made up of 19 communes − from the chic Ixelles district to up-and-coming Anderlecht − it’s a city with many faces. Each quarter offers a different take on the personality of “Europe’s capital,” which is apt in itself: in Belgium, very little matches the monochrome preconception. 30,528 sq km (11,787 sq miles). 11,267,910 (2016). 363 per sq km.

Known as the Treaty of Verdun and signed in AD 843, it effectively split his territories up into the early divisions of France, Germany and the Low Countries. Flanders remained part of the Germanic Frankish lands, while Wallonia belonged to the Roman Empire and its Latin language.   Ownership of the area passed between Spanish, Austrian and French kings, with great wealth and high art flourishing during the peaceful years of 1419-1467 and 1579-1620. Cloth-trading towns such as Bruges, Ypres and Ghent became particularly rich.  Independence only came in 1830 when the citizens staged an uprising against Dutch ruler William of Orange and had their freedom formally recognised by Great Britain and France at the London Conference in 1831. Leopold I was inaugurated as the country's first king and was succeeded by his son Leopold II, who has achieved notoriety in the modern era for pouring the riches he gained from exploitation of the Congo into magnificent buildings like the Royal Greenhouses of Laeken in Brussels. During this time, French was the official language of government and the upper classes, while Dutch remained the dialect of the working classes. The divide created fluctuating friction between Dutch-speaking Flanders and French-speaking Wallonia and it continues to this day. The country suffered four years of German occupation during World War 1, seeing some of the most intense conflicts of the entire campaign and emerging in a ruinous condition, an experience repeated during World War 2. However, it experienced rapid economic growth in the post-War era thanks largely to regeneration money granted by the US Marshall Plan. By developing its 'light' industries, Flanders subsequently overtook Wallonia's once-profitable coal industry and continues to support its southern counterpart to the tune of €10 billon a year − a cause of much grumbling among the Flemish. A constitutional monarchy, King Philippe succeeded his father Albert II who abdicated due to ill health in July 2013 and the royal family is credited as a unifying force between the two language communities. Did you know?  Belgium loves a procession and the Carnival of Binches with its famous Gilles and the Processional Giants and Dragons of Ath, Brussels, Dendermonde, Mechelen and Mons are recognised by UNESCO as Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Mankind.  Outside of France, Belgians hold the most Tour-de France victories.  French fries actually originate in Belgium. (French readers may dispute this!) Mainly Christian (65%) with a large portion being Roman Catholic (58%, although few attend regular mass), with small Protestant and Jewish communities. Knowing which language to speak where can be tricky. Avoid speaking Dutch in Wallonia and French in Flanders. Most locals are laidback, but it can cause offence if you get it wrong in some circles. If in doubt, speak English. Outside of business transactions, it’s customary to kiss three times on alternate cheeks. Guests should bring flowers, or a small present, for the hostess if they’re invited for a meal and it is customary to wish everyone bon appetit/eet smakelijk at the start of a meal. Dress is similar to other Western nations: jeans and a smart top suffices for most occasions, including nights out. Smoking is banned in venues where food is served. Belgium has three official languages: Dutch, French and German. Dutch is spoken in Flanders, the northern half of the country, and French is spoken in the southern Wallonia region. German is spoken in an eastern enclave. English is widely spoken in Flanders, but less so in Wallonia.

Summer days are long with it often staying light until 2230 and temperatures reaching 25-30°C (77-86°F), intermingled with occasional drizzly days. Heat waves are becoming more frequent in mid-August, so be sure to drink enough water. Winter days are short, with darkness falling around 1700. Winds blowing from the North Pole can be biting, especially on the coast, and can push the temperature down to -5°C (23°F); snow is fairly common in January. Rainfall is common throughout the year so bring a waterproof jacket with a hood, so you don’t have to bother with an unwieldy umbrella. Otherwise, pack light clothing, sunscreen, sunglasses and a hat for summer and lots of layers, a hat, scarf and gloves for the winter months. Sturdy walking shoes are best for tackling the cobblestones found in many of the city centres. If you plan to take part in any activities, or rent bikes, be sure to bring a helmet and any specialist sports clothing with you. Belgium is situated in northwestern Europe, bordered by France to the south, Germany to the east,Luxembourg to the southeast and the Netherlands to the north. There is 60km (37 miles) of North Sea coastline to the northwest. The country is divided into three regions: southern French-speaking Wallonia, northern Dutch-speaking Flanders and Brussels nestled between the two. Both Flanders and Wallonia are then subdivided into ten provinces: within Flanders they are West Flanders, East Flanders, Flemish Brabant, Antwerp and Limburg; within Wallonia they are Hainaut, Walloon Brabant, Namur, Liège and Luxembourg (not to be confused with the neighbouring country of Luxembourg). Flanders’ landscape is characterised by low-lying polders near the coast, changing to rolling hills and fertile farming grounds in the Flemish Brabant and finishing with the wooded Hoge Kempen − Flanders’ only national park − in the east. Flowing across this landscape is the country’s largest river the Scheldt, which enters Belgium near Tournai and flows out to sea at Antwerp. In contrast, landlocked Wallonia is dominated by intensive farming in its northern provinces, watered by the Sambre and Meuse rivers, with the terrain rising to form the hills and gorges of the Ardennes in the south. Belgium’s highest point is Signal de Botrange, at 694m (2280ft), located in the far east."
europe,bosnia-and-herzegovina,"Despite a tumultuous background, Bosnia-Herzegovina has emerged as a compelling, multi-faceted travel destination. Most notable amongst the country's many charms is its lush, mountainous landscape, best seen from the vantage point of one of its national parks. Bosnia-Herzegovina still bears the legacy of war, but there are plenty of positives to take from the country's urban centres, especially the cosmopolitan capital of Sarajevo. With its rich history and lively nightlife, this diverse city has become one of Europe's most curious, unique capitals. The old town of Sarajevo is divided between the evocative Ottoman quarter of historic mosques, little streets filled with cafes and craft workshops, and the trendy Austria-Hungarian quarter built during the late 19th century – truly a case of east meets west. Sarajevo also has several museums explaining its history, while climbing the steep hills rewards you with a stirring view of the city. One oddity is the colossal bobsleigh track from the 1984 Winter Olympics that runs through the forests of Trebevic mountain; it was destroyed during the Siege of Sarajevo in 1990s and is now a canvas for local street artists. Beyond Sarajevo, much of the country is relatively undeveloped, but there are several historic fortresses to see, no shortage of splendid old mosques, and a number of monasteries and Catholic shrines. The second city (at least by reputation), Mostar is also increasingly popular with tourists. Perhaps above all else, it is the city’s 16th century Ottoman bridge that symbolises both the past and a positive new beginning for the country. Destroyed during the war, it has since been painstakingly reconstructed, and was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2005. 51,129 sq km (19,741 sq miles). 3,798,672 (UN estimate 2016). 75.6 per sq km.

Prime Minister Borjana Kristo since 2022.","Once part of the Roman province of Dalmatia, modern-day Bosnia was briefly occupied by Goths, until it became an outpost in the Byzantine Empire during the Middle Ages for some six centuries. From 1180, when Byzantine rule came to an end, and by 1463, when the Ottoman Turks took control, Bosnia was more or less an independent state under a succession of strong rulers who expanded the territory southwards to take in the province of Hum (now Herzegovina). As a province of the Ottoman Empire, Bosnia and Herzegovina had two distinguishing characteristics: firstly, much of the population converted to Islam; secondly, as a frontier province, it was the first line of defence against incursions into the Ottoman sphere of influence. Consequently, the country suffered from repeated invasions. Under pressure from the Austrians, Ottoman rule began to weaken during the 18th and 19th centuries, until the Turks were expelled following the Russo/Serbian-Turkish war of 1876, and Bosnia was assigned to the Austro-Hungarian Empire by the Congress of Berlin. The decision by Vienna to annex Bosnia fully in 1908 produced a destabilising chain of events contributing to the First Balkan war of 1912-1913, then to the assassination of the Austrian Archduke Franz Ferdinand in the Bosnian capital, Sarajevo, by a Serb revolutionary, Gavrilo Princip. This assassinating in June 1914 is considered by many the trigger for WWI. At the end of the war, with the approval of the victorious Great Powers, Serbia annexed Bosnia as part of the new Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, which was renamed Yugoslavia in 1929. Following the Communist take-over in 1945, Bosnia and Herzegovina became a constituent republic of the new Yugoslav federation. The ethnic rivalries characteristic of the region's politics were largely kept at bay during this era, before unravelling tragically in the 1990s. With a population split almost equally three ways between Serbs, Croats and Muslims, Bosnia became a key battleground as Yugoslavia disintegrated, until NATO forces intervened to stop the ethnic cleansing that was taking place. Peace has largely held since then – despite rival ethnic nationalists gaining ground in the 2014 general election. However, the country's economic frailty is arguably of more concern to today's population. Did you know? • Lasting longer than the siege of any other capital city in modern history, the Siege of Sarajevo endured from 1992 to 1996 – a year longer than the Siege of Leningrad. • The 1984 Winter Olympics were held in Sarajevo, but during the 1990s the infrastructure (think ski runs, bobsled courses, etc.) was used as target practice by the Serbian Army. • The 2014 FIFA World Cup was Bosnia and Herzegovina’s first major football tournament. 45% Muslim, 36% Orthodox, 15% Roman Catholic, 4% Protestant, Jews and other denominations. Bosnia and Herzegovina is characterised by its ethnic and religious diversity and visitors should respect the customs and traditions of the various ethnic and religious groups. The main ethnic groups are the Bosniaks (48%, also sometimes referred to as Bosnian Muslims), the Serbs (37.1%) and the Croats (14.3%). Visitors should be aware that drinking alcohol in public may be considered offensive by more orthodox Muslims. Visitors should avoid expressing opinions about the war or other sensitive issues. The official languages are Bosnian, Serbian and Croatian. The Croats and Bosniaks use the Latin alphabet, whereas the Serbs use the Cyrillic.","Dominated by mountainous and hilly terrain, and drained by major rivers to the north (Sava) and east (Drina), Bosnia and Herzegovina has a climate that is as variable as the rest of the former Yugoslav federation, with moderate continental climatic conditions generally the norm (very cold winters and hot summers). In winter, heavyweight clothing and overcoat. In summer, lightweight clothing and raincoat required, with mediumweight clothing at times in the colder and wetter north, and at higher altitudes elsewhere. Roughly triangular in shape, and the geopolitical centre of the former Yugoslav Federation, Bosnia and Herzegovina shares borders with Serbia in the east, Montenegro in the southeast, and Croatia to the north and west, with a short Adriatic coastline of 20km (12 miles) in the south, but no ports."
europe,united-kingdom,"There are 14 British Overseas Territories in all. The last vestiges of the British Empire they are: Bermuda, Gibraltar, the British Virgin Islands, the Cayman Islands, the Falkland Islands, Turks and Caicos Islands, Anguilla, British Indian Ocean Territory, South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands, British Antarctic Territory, St Helena and its dependencies (Ascension and Tristan da Cunha), Montserrat, the Pitcairn Group of Islands, and the Sovereign Base Areas on Cyprus. These territories are under the sovereignty and formal control of the UK but are not an actual part of the UK. Most British Overseas Territories are self-governing but rely on the UK in crucial matters of foreign policy etc. Since they are separate jurisdictions, there is no British Overseas Territories' representation in the British parliament. The UK exerts its formal control through a governor of each territory, appointed by the British Monarch. In addition to the 14 British Overseas Territories, there are two British Crown Dependencies, which include the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands, which are dependencies of the British Crown whilst exercising considerable self-government in domestic affairs. Many British aspects are apparent in the crown dependencies, such as the UK telephone numbering plan or a BBC presence, although this is not always the case. Acts of the British parliament rarely – but occasionally – apply to the crown dependencies. The following territories and dependencies have their own sections: Anguilla, Bermuda, British Virgin Islands, Cayman Islands, Falkland Islands, Gibraltar, Montserrat, Turks & Caicos Islands, the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands.  Approx. 250,000 (estimate 2010)",,
europe,bulgaria,"Bulgaria's spectacular mountains, golden beaches and vibrant cities have begun attracting hordes of eager-eyed tourists over the past few years. As a result, beautiful ski and beach resorts are expanding quickly. The main cities have shrugged off the weary Communist-era image and have become vibrant and attractive, with a string of cultural attractions, varied shopping and lively nightlife keeping visitors entertained. In contrast, many towns and villages have preserved the authentic Bulgarian spirit and hospitality - the country is especially proud of its rich folklore traditions. Hikers will find a variety of mountain ranges covering much of the country, with plenty of extraordinary wildlife to be glimpsed along the way. The walking trails are well mapped, taking hikers through forests, past lakes and waterfalls, with the chance to spot bears, wolves and lynx. Those keen on caving and kayaking will also find plenty to entertain them, while skiing and snowshoeing are also popular here. Of course, the attraction that brings most visitors to Bulgaria is its remarkably unspoiled beaches strewn along the Black Sea coast. Less-visited, less-developed and with lots of facilities for water sports, Bulgaria's sandy beaches are the equal to almost any of the more popular coastal spots in the Mediterranean. What's more, you'll find many aged seaside towns complete with cobbled streets and historic buildings. Bulgaria is home to seven UNESCO World Heritage cultural sites including: • Ancient city of Nessebar, a 3,000-year-old site which was originally a Thracian settlement and became a Greek colony in the 6th century. • Boyana Church, a medieval Bulgarian Orthodox church on the outskirts of Sofia. • Madara Rider, a large rock relief depicting a knight triumphing over a lion in Madara. • Rila Monastery, the largest and most famous Eastern Orthodox monastery in Bulgaria. • Rock-hewn churches of Ivanovo, a series of chapels, churches and monasteries within the Rusenski Lom Nature Park. • Thracian tomb of Kazanlak, a richly decorated burial chamber from the Hellenistic period. • Thracian tomb of Sveshtari, an amazing historical site reflecting the fundamental structural principles of Thracian cult buildings. In addition, Bulgaria also has three natural sites that are also UNESCO-listed including ancient and primeval beech forest of the Carpathians, Pirin National Park and Srebarna Nature Reserve. 110,994 sq km (42,855 sq miles). 6,984,078 (2019) 64.8 per sq km.

Between the 7th and 11th century, the country’s history was marked by many conflicts, but it also allowed Bulgaria to become a powerful empire after several victories. After a brief period which saw Bulgaria becoming part of the Byzantine Empire, the Second Bulgarian Empire occurred in 1185, following the uprising led by Asen and Peter of the Asen Dynasty. For the next 185 years, Bulgaria went through several major political crises and in 1371, Bulgaria was under the control of the Ottoman Empire and became a Turkish territory for the next 500 years. After WWII, Bulgaria became a Communist state. Bulgaria’s dominant political figure was Todor Zhivkov, under whose leadership Bulgaria became the staunchest of Moscow’s allies. In 1989, Zhivkov resigned and a multi-party election was held in June 1990 with the ruling Communists restyling themselves the Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP) and winning an absolute majority. Throughout the first half of the 1990s, Bulgaria was wracked by instability and plunged into economic crisis as internal conflicts deepened, leading many professionals to emigrate. Bulgaria became a NATO member in 2004, and joined the EU in 2007. In recent years, Bulgarian politics have stabilised and the country attracted almost 8 million tourists a year in 2018. In 1989, Zhivkov resigned and the first multi-party elections for 44 years were held in June 1990 with the ruling Communists restyling themselves the Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP) and winning an absolute majority. Did you know? • Swiss-born gymnast Charles Champaud competed for Bulgaria in the first modern Olympics in Athens in 1896, the year after he brought football to the capital Sofia. • To welcome spring each year martenitsa, small red and white dolls made of yarn, are traditionally worn from 1 March until the wearer first sees a stork, swallow or blossoming tree. • Estimated to be over 1670 years old, the Granit Oak – a common oak tree named after the village in which it is found – may be the oldest living oak tree in the world. The majority of the population are Christian, the main denomination being Bulgarian Orthodox Church with a membership of 59.4% of the population. Eastern Orthodox Christianity is considered to be the traditional religion in Bulgaria. There is also a significant Muslim minority (7.8%) and a small Jewish community. Normal courtesies should be observed and handshaking is the normal form of greeting. Dress should be conservative but casual. If invited to a home, a small souvenir from one's homeland is an acceptable gift, and something for their children is always welcome. Remember that a nod of the head means 'No' and a shake means 'Yes'. Bulgarian is the official language and the Cyrillic alphabet is used - Bulgaria is the only EU nation to use it. English, German, French and Russian are spoken in major tourist resorts and hotels.","The climate in Bulgaria is continental, but changes to humid subtropical climate along the Black Sea Coast. The country’s mountain chains and large plains, along with cold air masses from the north and warm air masses from the Mediterranean, all have an impact on the climate in Bulgaria. Sofia is the capital and the largest city in Bulgaria. Geographically it sits in western Bulgaria, between Vitosha Mountain and the Balkan Mountains range. Sofia has a humid continental climate with cold winter and hot summer. Sofia has an average precipitation of 581mm (22 inches) a year, with spring and summer being wetter than other seasons. See the weather in Sofia and the best time to go guide for more information. Plovdiv is the second largest city and an ideal base for wine tourism in the Thracian Valley. It has four distinct seasons with temperatures vary wildly. Summer usually starts in May and ends in late September, with average highs reaching 31°C (88°F) in July and August, but it is also fairly common to see temperatures climbing to 40°C (104°F) and beyond. Winter is cold, with average lows dipping below the freezing point from December to February. The best time to visit Plovdiv is from April to July, then September to October. Burgas and Varna on the Black Sea Coast have a humid subtropical climate and both places enjoy long, hot summer from May to October, with average highs reaching 28°C (82°F) in July and August. Rainfall is evenly distributed throughout the year, although November is usually the wettest month. Winter is milder than inland areas but can be cold too. January is the coldest month with an average low of -1°C (30°F). Lightweights in the summer and heavyweights in winter. Waterproofs and extra layers are useful too. Bulgaria is situated in Eastern Europe and bordered to the north by the River Danube and Romania, to the east by the Black Sea, to the south by Turkey and Greece and to the west by Serbia and the Republic of North Macedonia. The Balkan Mountains cross the country reaching to the edge of the Black Sea and its golden beaches. The land is heavily cultivated, covered with forests and crossed by rivers. Although Bulgaria lies in the very southeast corner of Europe, the climate is temperate – cold, damp winters and hot, dry summers. The Black Sea resorts have some of the largest beaches in Europe and offer sunbathing from May until October, while in winter heavy falls of snow are virtually guaranteed in the mountain ski resorts."
europe,spain,"Drifting like flotsam off the coast of northwest Africa, the Canary Islands have long been a popular destination for sun-seeking Europeans. Synonymous with sandy beaches, sprawling holiday resorts and glorious weather, the archipelago is comprised of seven islands, which form one of Spain’s most distant territories. Gran Canaria and Tenerife are probably the most mainstream islands. Their family-friendly resorts and sweeping beaches are packed most of the year with tourists from Europe and beyond. Meanwhile, Fuerteventura is famous for its wind-driven water sports and has some of the finest beaches in the region. Tourism is the lifeblood of these islands, but their dependency on this source of income has led to some unsettling consequences, such as rampant development of once beautiful coastlines and hedonistic holidaymakers breaching the peace. While not all of the islands have found the balance between developing tourism and preserving local life, Lanzarote has managed to combine modern resorts with eco-friendly developments and more aesthetically sensitive designs. While most visitors come to the Canaries for sun, sea and sand, the archipelago is of volcanic origin and offers strikingly diverse landscapes including sub-tropical flora, abundant pine forests, giant sand dunes and mountain peaks. Want to escape the crowds? La Gomera is a charming and undeveloped island, which can be visited as a day-trip from Tenerife (just 30 minutes by ferry). Meanwhile, little-visited La Palma is green, uncommercialised and arguably the most beautiful island. And most westerly of all is El Hierro, windblown and well off the beaten track, it attracts a handful of hardy hikers each year. Closer to Africa than Spain, the islands were conquered by the Castilians in the early 15th century and although they remain part of the motherland, the Canarians have a distinct culture, with many calling for greater autonomy and some independence. 7,242 sq km (2,796 sq miles). 2,100,306 (INE value 2015). 290 per sq km. Provincial capitals are Las Palmas de Gran Canaria and Santa Cruz de Tenerife.","Believed by some to be part of the remains of the mythological lost continent of Atlantis, the Canary islands' human history stretches back to antiquity. There is some evidence that the Phoenicians landed there as far back as the 12th century BC, while the Romans knew them as the 'Fortunate Isles' – but did not occupy them. Little is known about the islands' original inhabitants, though they are today believed to be related to Berbers. Genoese traders landed on the Canaries in the early 14th century, with a Captain Lanzarotto lending his name to one of the islands – which were finally conquered in the 15th century. Jean de Béthencourt, an adventurer-lord of Granville in Normandy, set out to convert the islands to Christianity in 1402, or so he claimed. The mission turned ugly, with many of the natives sold into slavery. The islands gradually came under Spanish imperial control over the course of several bloody campaigns. The native inhabitants proved highly rebellious and difficult to control, but many continued to be sold as slaves, and the remainder converted to Christianity. Some slaves were later freed, returned and assimilated with the colonisers, but their language and culture all but disappeared. Pirate raids between the Moroccan coast and the archipelago went on over subsequent years, while in the 17th and 18th centuries, Britain continually challenged Spain for control of the islands, culminating in Nelson’s strike on Santa Cruz; the Admiral lost his right arm in the attack, and British adventures in the area came to end. After this, the main threat to the Canaries came from within, as rivalries between the islands threatened to split the province apart. This did finally happen in 1927, when Madrid turned the Canaries into two provinces. In 1936, General Franco was transferred to the islands by a central government suspicious of a coup. Franco justified their fears by taking control of the islands, using them as a launchpad for the Spanish Civil War. After the war, many Canarios emigrated to escape economic ruin. Only when Franco began to court tourism did the islands recover. When Franco died and power was devolved to regions in the new democratic Spain, the islands became a comunidadautónoma. A small but significant independence movement that first stirred under Franco has grown steadily ever since. Apart from tourism, immigration from Africa has transformed the islands in recent years, with the islands now putting emphasis on investment in their African neighbours to relieve the pressure. Did you know? • Christopher Columbus stopped at the islands more than once en route to discovering the Americas in 1492. • One of England's greatest military victories over Spain came in 1657, when the Royal Navy completely destroyed a Spanish treasure fleet at the cost of only one ship near Tenerife. • For many years, Gran Canaria and Tenerife were fierce rivals for control over the archipelago, nearly leading to war between them.","Summer sunshine is guaranteed on all the islands. At other times of year however El Hierro and La Palma can be cool, with a west European spring-like climate. Both Tenerife and Gran Canaria have a north-south divide with parched southern shores and cooler, slightly wetter northern climes. However, by European standards rainfall is low throughout the islands. Lightweight cottons for much of the year with shower protection and warmer wear in winter. The Canary Islands are situated between 96km (60 miles) and 304km (189 miles) off the northwest coast of Africa. The southern coast of Spain lies 1,120km (696 miles) south. Las Palmas comprises the islands of Gran Canaria, Fuerteventura and Lanzarote. Santa Cruz de Tenerife is made up of Tenerife, La Palma, Gomera and Hierro. All the islands are of volcanic origin and the climate is subtropical. The landscape is varied, and includes mountain ranges, valleys, deserts, cliffs, craters and forests."
europe,channel-islands,"As their name suggests, the Channel Islands are sprinkled across that narrow channel of sea that divides France and the UK. Made up of Alderney, Guernsey, Jersey, Sark and Herm, they are all actually much closer to France than England, but as any visitor will find, they are very British in character. There are also other, very small islands in the group, which are not normally open to visitors. All the islands offer gorgeous, often dramatic coastlines, natural and historic harbours, a surprising range of birds and subtropical flora thanks to the warm Gulf of St Malo. You'll also find what may be the best seafood in the UK, and glimpses of a traditional British lifestyle that some say has faded from the mainland. Most visitors land by ferry or plane at one of the biggest islands, Guernsey and Jersey, with good connections from both England and France. The passage over the channel from the UK is relatively calm and easy, while affording you a look at the white cliffs of Dover. There's also a fleet of ferries connecting the different islands, so you can easily take in all of them over a few days. There's plenty of intriguing history surrounding the Channel Islands to boot, as you'll find on touring their museums. The Channel Islands were famously occupied in World War II, the only part of Great Britain to come under Nazi control during the conflict. You'll have the chance to explore old war tunnels and bunkers, while appreciating the bravery of the islanders in the face of a ruthless enemy. Although people from the Channel Islands are proudly British, they are also fiercely independent – for the record, these are self-governing British Crown dependencies. People speak English, but the names of places are more French. All in all, they're a unique corner of Britain that visitors will agree are well worth a look.",,
europe,croatia,"Occupying a stunning stretch of the Adriatic coastline, Croatia is one of Europe's top seaside destinations. Boasting more than 1,100 islands, the country is renowned for its limpid waters and picture-perfect scenery. But Croatia is much more than sea and sunshine – it’s home to historic walled cities and spectacular Roman ruins, as well as imposing castles and unspoiled national parks. The fantastic cuisine, including seafood on the coast and truffles in Istria, fine wines and buzzing café culture add to the appeal. The capital, Zagreb, can be called quintessentially Central European. Everything from the architecture to the hearty cuisine reflects the region’s centuries-old ties with the Austro-Hungarian Empire. The city also makes a good base from which to explore the historic castles and vineyards of Zagorje. One thing that has changed greatly in the last decade in Croatia is tourism. The coast was once an undiscovered, undeveloped natural wonder as beautiful as Italy's, but without the fanfare. Now tourists from Britain, Germany and beyond flock to the Dalmatian region, and many have snapped up holiday homes. The gorgeous seaside cities of Split and Dubrovnik still maintain their charm, but tend to be crowded with tourists during the day. The evenings in these coastal hubs tend to be much quieter, and there are often classical music concerts and other events in the city centres. Beyond the tourist zones, Croatia is full of isolated places where you can discover more traditional, local life. Head to Plitvice for its amazing, lake-strewn national park, or explore the rugged mountain ranges of Velebit and Gorski Kotar, havens for hiking. Back on the Adriatic, Croatia offers ideal sailing conditions, scuba diving and sea kayaking. And of course, those in search of a more restful holiday can enjoy hours of sunshine on the beach. As Europe's top naturist destination, Croatia is also a place where you can even get that all-over tan. Clothing is advised if you’re planning to explore the country’s seven UNESCO World Heritage Sites, world-class museums and festivals, which come thick and fast throughout the summer. 56,542 sq km (21,831 sq miles). 4,218,584 (UN estimate 2016). 79 per sq km. Zagreb. Republic. President Zoran Milanović since 2020. Prime Minister Tihomir Orešković since 2016.","Croatia has a long and eventful history. Although Greek colonies were present on its coast from around the 6th century BC, this was an Illyrian-dominated territory until Celtic tribes began to push them into modern-day Albania in the 4th century BC. The tough Illyrians managed to hold much of Croatia, however, until the Romans defeated the last Illyrian king in 168BC. The Romans ultimately brought the whole Dalmatian coast under imperial control, going on to rule for some five centuries. They built roads, trading outposts and fortresses, including the grand palace in Split, the finest Roman ruin of its kind in Eastern Europe. Towards the end of the Roman era, there were two Dalmatian emperors, including the great Diocletian. After the collapse of the Roman Empire, Croats alongside other Slavic tribes began to move westwards. In the 7th century they are thought to have attacked Byzantine Dalmatia with the help of the Avars. By the 8th century, powerful Croat clans in the region had emerged, and an independent Croatian state was established in the 10th century. It lasted less than 200 years. Over subsequent centuries, Croatia was alternately ruled by Hungary, Venice, Napoleon and Austria. After WWI, a new 'Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes' was created, and following WWII, Croatia became part of Tito’s Yugoslavia along with Serbia, Slovenia, Bosnia, Macedonia. On 25 June 1991, Croatia declared itself independent from Yugoslavia, a move that resulted in an infamously drawn-out conflict. Croatia was pitted against the might of the Yugoslav army and Serb irregular forces. In any case, by December 1991 the German government had recognised Croatian independence, with the rest of the world quickly following suit. The death of the country's first democratically elected president, Franjo Tudjman, in 1999 heralded a new era of Croatian politics; Stjepan Mesić stepped into the fold and Croatia adopted a more conciliatory approach at home and abroad. In 2009, Jadranka Kosor became Croatia's first female prime minister following the surprise resignation of former PM, Ivo Sanader. In 2013, Croatia became a member of the European Union. Did you know? •	The English poet Lord Byron once described Dubrovnik as the “pearl of the Adriatic”. •	While the old Slavic Glagolitic alphabet was replaced by Cyrillic in the Middle Ages, the Croats kept it alive until the 20th century – mostly in liturgical writing. •	Ancient Egyptians in Croatia?

The official language is Croatian (Hrvatski). Ethnic minorities living in Croatia also speak Serbian, Slovenian, Hungarian and Italian. People working in tourism generally speak excellent English, plus some Italian and German.","Croatia has a varied climate, with continental climate conditions inland and Mediterranean influence on the Adriatic coast. Peak season is July - August, with temperatures in the high 20s or in the 30s in places like Split, but you can expect plenty of sunshine from roughly May to October on the coast, and the shoulder seasons (May-June and September) are among the best times to visit Croatia. Inland is also hot in the summer but can be bitterly cold in the winter with sub-zero temperatures and heavy snowfall. Winter on the coast is milder but can be quite rainy. Lightweights and beachwear (including sun protection) for summer. Mediumweights for winter with heavy, warm clothing for inland areas. It is a good idea to pack waterproofs at any time of year. Croatia stretches along the Adriatic coast, narrowing north-south, with a larger inland area (Slavonia) running west-east from Zagreb to the border with Serbia. The northern two-thirds of this border are formed by the River Drava, the east by the Danube, the southern part by the Sava. The country borders Slovenia and Hungary to the north, Serbia to the east, Montenegro to the southeast and Bosnia & Herzegovina (southeast from Zagreb; northeast from the Adriatic coastline). The coastline is highly indented, with over 1,100 islands and islets lying offshore."
europe,cyprus,"The legendary birthplace of Aphrodite, Cyprus is every inch the Mediterranean – sandy beaches, ancient monasteries, classical ruins, thyme scented mountains, terracotta pottery and, of course, the obligatory party resorts full of sun-seeking twenty-somethings. Cyprus has always been at the crossroads between Europe and Asia. In ancient times, a succession of empires squabbled over its seaports and mountain fortresses, which guaranteed supremacy over the eastern Mediterranean. These empire-builders left behind an incredible legacy of historical relics: ancient Greek and Roman ruins, Crusader castles, mighty Venetian city walls and towering mosques and minarets left behind by Ottoman invaders. Until the 1970s, Cyprus was a sleepy backwater, but a devastating civil war saw the island split into Greek Cypriot and Turkish states. In the south, the Greek Republic of Cyprus grew into a modern European state, while the Turkish north half of the island remains isolated, recognised only by Turkey and well off the mainstream tourist radar. After Partition, tourist development went into overdrive in the Greek half of the island, with the emergence of Ayia Napa, Protaras, Limassol, Paphos and a string of other package holiday resorts along the southern coast. This is one face of Cyprus – whitewashed villas, sunbathers, banana-boat rides, boisterous nightclubs and hordes of young people enjoying blistering summer sunshine. Inland, the old Cyprus endures, with beautiful villages full of UNESCO-listed churches, peaceful mountain trails and vineyards that have been producing wines since ancient times. A similar old-world atmosphere pervades in the divided capital, Lefkosia (Nicosia), where quiet lanes lined with Turkish mosques and Byzantine churches come to a sudden halt at the Green Line, the de facto border between the two enclaves. The north is something else again, more Turkish than Greek, even down to the menus on restaurant tables, but studded with ancient ruins and dramatic Crusader castles. While rampant development is taking place along the coast around Famagusta (Gazimagusa) and Kyrenia (Girne), the remote Karpas Peninsula offers a journey back in time, where ancient ruins spill out onto golden beaches that see more sea turtles than human visitors. 9,251 sq km (3,572 sq miles). 1,195,204 (UN estimate 2019). 129.19 per sq km.

It was first inhabited by Neolithic man and subsequently settled by the Mycenaean Greeks, before being conquered in turn by the Assyrians, Egyptians and Persians then seized by Alexander the Great in the fourth century. It was incorporated into the Classical Roman Empire then the Eastern Byzantine Empire and following a brief rule by Arab caliphates fell to the English King Richard I. A year later he sold it to the Knights Templar, who in turn sold it to the French Lusignans before the Venetians assumed control in the late 15th century. They held it until 1571 when an all-out assault brought it under the control of the Ottoman Empire where it remained for three centuries before being leased to Great Britain in 1878. Being close to the Suez Canal, the main route to India, under British rule Cyprus was a key military base. After WWI, during which Cyprus had been formally annexed by Britain, the newly created Turkish republic renounced any claim over Cyprus and in 1925 it became a British colony. Greek and Turkish Cypriots fought on the Allied side during WWII, with thousands of Cypriots serving the British Army, however after the war nationalists began to agitate for self-determination, either as a nation in its own right, or as part of Greece or Turkey. In the event, Cyprus gained independence in 1960 with the charismatic Archbishop Makarios III as its first president. The island remained fraught with ethnic tension and independence fell apart in 1974 when Makarios was deposed by the Greek military junta. Within days, Turkish troops invaded, the Greeks failed to respond effectively and only after Turkey had taken control of the northern third of the island was a ceasefire arranged by the United Nations with a buffer zone now known as the “Green Line.” Cyprus has remained partitioned ever since by a divide that runs through the heart of its capital Nicosia. In mid-2015 the president of Cyprus Nicos Anastasiades and Turkish-Cypriot leader Mustafa Akinci met and resolved to work towards ending its partition. Anastasiades and Akinci released a joint statement in October of 2018 that crossing points at Lefka/Aplici and Deryneia/Derinya would open the following month, but general reunification talks are still stalled due to disagreements over shared power and security provisions. Watch this space. Did you know? • Legend has it that the Greek goddess of love, Aphrodite, emerged into the world from the surf off what is today known as Aphrodite’s Beach. • The Cypriot dessert wine, Commandaria, is the oldest named wine in the world. • The writer Lawrence Durrell lived on Cyprus from 1952 until 1956. Greek Orthodox is the main religion of Cyprus, with Islam the most prominent in the north. The family, which includes the extended family, is at the centre of Cypriot society. Particular respect is shown to elders. It is not uncommon to see great, great relatives cradling tiny babies, especially at family occasions and festivals. Religious beliefs are also at the core of society and all members of the family are expected to attend church regularly. It is customary to shake hands when greeting, irrespective of whether you have just met or have known the person a long time. Normal courtesies should also be observed. It is viewed as impolite to refuse an offer of Greek coffee or a cold drink. For most occasions, casual attire is acceptable. Beachwear should be confined to the beach or poolside. More formal wear is required for business, and in more exclusive dining rooms and social functions. Photography is forbidden near military camps or installations. A licence from the appropriate authorities is required to photograph museum artefacts - this can sometimes be purchased from the museum's ticket desk. No flash photography is allowed in churches with murals or icons. Authorization from authorities is required in advance to photograph archeological sites, military zones and the demarcation line, underwater and by air. The majority of Cypriots (approximately 80%) speak Greek and approximately 11% speak Turkish. The Greek Cypriot dialect is different from mainland Greek. Turkish is spoken by Turkish Cypriots. English, German and French are also spoken in tourist centres.","Cyprus has a Mediterranean climate with sunshine likely on most days of the year. Spring (March to May) sees average high hovering between 19-24°C (66-75°F) and rainfall levels drop dramatically as the season progresses. The period between April to May tends to be quieter and is ideal for exploring the island and enjoying pursuits such as cycling and hiking. Summer (June to August) is dry with plenty of sunshine and average highs reaching 30°C (86°F). This is the best time to visit Cyprus for those who like the heat, although the intense sun can make sightseeing a challenge. The heat is tempered by sea breezes in coastal areas. Drinking lots of water is essential to avoiding dehydration. Autumn (September to November) starts off warm and dry, but by November, average high drops to 22°C (72°F) and rain-bearing winds start to hit the country. Winter (December to February) is mild with often heavy, although sporadic, tropical-style rainstorms. Villages located on higher ground are sometimes subjected to freezing temperatures and frost, while heavy snowfall is experienced in the interior Troodos Mountains and usually stays for several weeks, providing decent ski conditions. Pack lightweight, cotton clothing for the summer months, such as loose tops, shorts and linen trousers, along with a hat to protect against the sun. Warmer medium-weight clothing is ideal for spring, autumn and sunny winter days, together with cardigans or jackets for evenings, which can get very cold. Rainwear should be packed for winter visits. Cyprus is the third-largest island in the Mediterranean and lies to the east at a point where European, Asian and Middle Eastern cultures merge. To the east of the island is Syria and Lebanon, while to the southeast is Israel and to the west is Greece and its Dodecanese group of islands. North of Cyprus is Turkey, South of Cyprus is Egypt. The island’s landscape varies between rugged coastlines with dramatic gorges, bays and sandy beaches, rocky hills, flat plains, river valleys and forest-covered mountains. The Troodos Mountains dominate the interior of the island. Its highest peak is Mount Olympus at 1,952m (6,400ft) above sea level. North of Nicosia and following a course towards the barren Karpasia Peninsula runs the mountain range of Pentadaktylos, meaning “five fingers” after its shape. Between the two is the fertile Mesaoria plain where much of the island’s produce is grown. To the west of the island is the Akamas peninsula, a thickly wooded area that runs from Agios Georgios around the headland to Latsi near Polis. It is home to a vast variety of flora and fauna, many species of which are endemic to Cyprus. In north Cyprus the Morphou basin runs around the coast of Morphou Bay."
europe,czech-republic,"A historic jewel at the heart of Europe, the Czech Republic packs a sizeable punch for such a small country; from majestic castles to medieval towns, elegant spa resorts to scenic national parks, it has much to offer international visitors. It is also, lest we forget, the birthplace of the world’s finest beer. At the heart of it all is the culture-crammed capital, Prague. Dubbed the “city of a thousand spires,” it comprises beautiful churches, cobbled lanes and medieval bridges, all watched over by a fairytale castle. Add to that a mix of ancient monuments, fine dining, old breweries, bustling markets and lively jazz clubs. There really is never a dull moment. Yet those who fail to venture beyond the city boundaries are truly missing out. Located just a short drive from the capital are some extraordinary attractions; the hot springs of Karlovy Vary; the giant gothic castle of Karlštejn; the church made of human bones in Kutná Hora; and the city of Plzeň, where pilsner beer was born. Formerly part of Czechoslovakia, since the Velvet Divorce of 1993 – when Slovakia and the Czech Republic parted company – the latter has emerged the more popular with tourists. And to understand its appeal one must consider its assets; the stunning wine-growing region of Monrovia, home to rolling hills, traditional food and the spirited cities of Brno and Olomouc; the snow-capped mountains of Krkonoše; the otherworldly rock formations of Český Ráj; the wild forests of Šumava National Park; and the historic town of Český Krumlov, a fully deserving UNESCO World Heritage Site. And yet, for all this, the Czech Republic is far more than the sum of its sights. This is a nation of proud, forthright and friendly people, eager to take a significant role on the European stage. It may only be a small country – and a relatively new one – but the Czech Republic leaves a big impression. 78,866 sq km (30,450 sq miles). 10,550,085 (UN estimate 2016). 135 per sq km. Prague. Republic. President Petr Pavel since 2023. Prime Minister Andrej Babis since 2017.","The Czech Republic is one of Europe's most fledgling states, having only come into existence in 1993. But the narrative of this land and its people stretches far back into European history. Prior to the Czech Republic, the territory formed the westernmost region of Czechoslovakia, a country which itself had only been created in 1918, following the collapse of the Habsburg Empire after WWI. But let's start at the beginning. There is evidence of life in this part of Europe since the Lower Palaeolithic era, yet the story of the Czech lands really began to take shape with the arrival of the Slavs in the 6th century. They founded the first West Slavic state, Great Moravia. This was followed by the Duchy of Bohemia, and later, the Kingdom of Bohemia, which reigned from the 9th century through to the 16th century, and oversaw a period of great prosperity and importance for the region (it is widely known by Czechs as 'the Golden Age'). The Habsburgs seized power of the Bohemian lands after this, and maintained this power in many different guises – latterly known as the Austro-Hungarian Empire – right up until the early 20th century. In 1918, from the ashes of the Habsburgs grew the new democratic state of Czechoslovakia, which had a significant role on the European stage. However, this was curtailed in 1938, as Hitler's forces began their invasion of the country and took control. The Nazis maintained power for most of the war, until September 1944, when its liberation was started by the Red Army. Unsurprisingly, it wasn't long before Czechoslovakia fell under communist rule, with a coup d'état in 1948 that would usher in 40 years of socialism. More liberal policies were briefly imposed in the 1960s – leader Alexander Dubček wanted to give socialism ‘a human face’ – but these were soon put to an end with the invasion of Soviet tanks in August 1968. Since the Velvet Revolution of 1989, and the Velvet Divorce of 1993 (when the nation agreed to split into two separate countries, the Czech Republic and Slovakia), the Czech Republic has cemented its ties with Western Europe, including signing up as a part of the European Union. And it is now one of the most stable and prosperous of all post-communist European states. Did you know? •	This may not come as a surprise to anyone that has been there, but Czech people consume the highest amount of beer per capita. •	Big Hollywood productions, including Casino Royale and Mission Impossible have all filmed in the Czech Republic. •	Former Czech President Václav Klau caused quite a stir back in 2011 after a video of him pocketing an expensive pen during an official visit to Chile went viral. Mostly Roman Catholic and some Protestant, including churches such as the Reformed, Lutheran, Methodist, Unity of Czech Brothers and Baptist. There is a small Jewish community, mainly in Prague. According to a Pew Research Center survey, 72% of the population were not affiliated with any religious beliefs. It is considered polite to say ‘dobrý den’ (good day) when you meet a stranger, including the person behind the counter in a shop or a pub. You should also say 'na shledanou’ (goodbye) when you leave. The Czech manner can feel a little brusque sometimes, but often a smile and a joke will lighten up most interactions. When greeting a new person, shake hands, and maintain eye contact. If you are invited to someone's house, it is polite to take a small gift - a bunch of flowers will do. Remember to remove your shoes when you enter. When attending a classical music concert, an opera performance or even the cinema, most Czechs will dress formally - you can usually spot the tourists by their casual clothes. There is a smoking ban in public places, in railway stations, on public transport and in restaurants and pubs. The official language is Czech, but Slovak is also widely spoken.

The climate is very seasonal – spring, summer, autumn and winter are very distinct, as epitomised by a Czech saying: “Březen, za kamna vlezem, duben, ještě tam budem, máj, půjdeme v háj” (“March – we get behind the stove, April – we’ll still be there, May – off we go to the garden”). Winter can see temperatures drop to low minus numbers, whilst the summer period from May to August can see them soar above 30ºC (86ºF). Rather inconveniently, summer also sees the highest rainfall across the country. Shoulder seasons, such as the months of September and October, will still be hot, but are also likely to be drier than preceding months, so it may be preferable to travel during this time. Depending on where in the country you’re travelling, the climate may differ considerably. In the mountains, the weather tends to be cooler, experiencing higher levels of precipitation at higher altitudes. No special clothes are required for the Czech Republic. Wear mediumweights, such as denim and heavy wools, a topcoat and sturdy shoes for winter. Lightweights such as cottons, linens and thin wools will be suitable for summer, but remember to bring waterproofs as rain showers are more frequent during this time. The Czech Republic is a landlocked country situated in central Europe, sharing frontiers with Germany in the west, Poland in the north, the Slovak Republic in the east, and Austria in the south. Covering only about one-third of the area of the United Kingdom, the country is hilly and picturesque. The western two-thirds of the country is known as Bohemia, and consists of a vast river basin fringed by hills and mountains. The Czech Republic's longest river, the Labe, rises in the Krkonoše Mountains in the northeast, on the border with Poland, and flows south, then west, then north into Germany where it becomes the River Elbe. These mountains are also home to the country's highest summit, Sněžka which stand 1,602m (5,262ft) tall. Prague sits almost in the middle of Bohemia on the River Vltava, which flows into the Labe just to the north of the city. The Vltava rises in the forested Šumava hills that run along the country's southern border with Austria. The plains to the north of Prague are bordered by the Krušné Hory (Ore Mountains, named for the iron ore and other minerals found there). The eastern third of the Czech Republic is known as Moravia. This region is also based on a river basin, that of the Morava River, which rises in the northern hills near the Polish border and flows south to join the Danube at Bratislava. The main city of Moravia is Brno, the second-largest in the Czech Republic."
europe,denmark,"Consistently ranked in the top three of the world's happiest nations, Denmark is a prosperous country with strong social benefits and low income inequality ratings. Copenhagen, the capital, is a cool, cosmopolitan city whose debonair inhabitants foster an affable atmosphere more typical of a small town than capital city. Synonymous with bold architecture and cutting-edge design, Copenhagen is also a culinary pioneer. The city's cobbled streets and windswept squares harbour some of the best restaurants in the world, most notably Noma, the brilliant brainchild of Rene Redzepi. The pedestrianised city centre of Copenhagen is a breeze to navigate – visitors can feel the pulse of the city in the Meatpacking District, rummage around the antique shops in the multicultural Nørrebro neighbourhood, embrace communal living in Freetown Christiania, and of course there is Nyhavn, best known for its quaint harbour, colourful merchants' houses and throbbing nightlife. But there's more to Denmark than its cool capital. Zealand, the island on which Copenhagen sits, is also home to Roskilde – once the Viking capital of Denmark. Along with a soaring UNESCO-listed cathedral, there's a museum housing some of the best-preserved Viking ships ever uncovered and a smattering of pretty cafés, shops and galleries. Since 1971, the city also hosts the annual Roskilde Festival with all proceeds going directly to humanitarian and cultural causes. Odense on the island of Funen is also a worthy diversion. The birthplace of Hans Christian Andersen (his yellow house on a cobbled street in the centre of Odense is now a poet museum), Odense is a cultural gem where you don’t have to wrestle with throngs of tourists. To the north, the Jutland west coast stretches for more than 500km (311 miles) from the marshlands of South Jutland to drifting sand dunes and wide sandy beaches of North Jutland. Skagen, Denmark's northernmost town on the east coast of the Skagen Odde peninsula in the far north of Jutland, is a favourite holiday destination among Danish families who come to bask on golden beaches and watch scintillating Scandinavian sunsets. Life is blissful here, it is little wonder that Denmark is one of the world’s happiest countries. 43,098 sq km (16,640 sq miles). 5,773,664 (estimate 2019). 134 per sq km. Copenhagen.

From the 9th century, the Danes, or Vikings, were fiercely colonial seafaring explorers who raided, traded and upbraided lands from Iceland to Canada and by the early 1000s they had colonised lands in England, Ireland and France. Having converted to Christianity, the Vikings were at their most powerful in the early 11th century, when Cnut the Great created a united Anglo-Danish kingdom with Norway that held for nearly 20 years. Denmark's power peaked in the early 13th century, by which time Cnut's successors had taken control of Scandinavia and parts of modern-day Germany, Estonia and Finland. This empire rapidly disintegrated and although Denmark, Norway and Sweden were reunited in the late 14th century through blood ties between their ruling families, the three nations spent much of the ensuing 350 years in near permanent conflict with one another. After establishing colonies in India, West Africa and the West Indies during the 17th century, Denmark discovered its libertarian heart and in the wake of the bloody People's Spring democratic revolutions in France, Germany, Austro-Hungary, Italy, Poland and other European countries in 1848, Denmark peacefully became a constitutional monarchy. Its lost appetite for war resulted in climactic defeat to Prussia and the Austrian Habsburg Empire and the cessation of Schleswig-Holstein in 1864. Afterwards Denmark sought to remain neutral in Europe and signed a non-aggression pact with Nazi Germany in 1939. Months later it was invaded. In the post-war era, Denmark co-founded NATO and the European Free Trade Association, joined the EEC (now the EU) in 1973 and rejected the Euro in 2000. Since 1953 Denmark's single-chamber parliament has been elected by proportional representation, making coalition administrations a standard feature.

In terms of precipitation, it has about 765mm (30 inches) a year. Spring (March to May) starts of cold but warms up gradually. This is usually the driest season. Summer (June to August) is the best season to visit as the weather is pleasant with long daylight – about 17 hours of daylight per day in June and July – thanks to its northerly latitude. In July, the average high in Copenhagen is 21°C (70°F) but temperatures are lower for cities in the north bordering the North Sea. Climate change is affecting every country including Denmark, so from time to time there are hot days which see temperatures climbing to 30°C (75°F) and beyond. Autumn (September to November) is often windy and rainy; pack a raincoat if you plan to visit during these months. Winter (December to February) is cold and the days are short (the sun sets between 3.30pm to 4.30pm in December). In January, the average high is 2°C (36°F) while the average low is -2°C (28°F) in Copenhagen, but in January 1987, the city saw the temperature drop to -18°C (-0.5°F). Weather in the Faroe Islands: The Faroe Islands are under the influence of the warm current of the Gulf Stream, as such they enjoy a very mild climate despite its latitude. Winters are mild, but the islands are often cloudy, windy and cool throughout the year. Summers are cool, but with long hours of daylight. Weather in Greenland: Greenland has an Arctic climate, with low humidity making temperatures feel warmer than expected. However, average temperatures in summer seldom exceed 10°C (50°F). You can also follow the link and see the weather in Copenhagen and the best time to visit Copenhagen guide for more information. As Denmark borders the North Sea and the Baltic Sea, it means the weather often changes, so pack a jacket and a raincoat if you're visiting in summer. Waterproof gear and extra layers are a must in autumn. Heavyweight for winter months and mediumweight is suitable for spring. Located south of Norway and southwest of Sweden, Denmark is the smallest Scandinavian country. The country consists of the peninsula of Jutland (which is north of Germany) and over 400 islands of various sizes, some inhabited and linked to the mainland by ferry or bridge. The landscape consists mainly of low-lying, fertile countryside broken by beech woods, small lakes and fjords. Greenland and the Faroe Islands are also under the sovereignty of the Kingdom of Denmark, although both have home rule. The Faroe Islands is a group of 18 major islands in the North Atlantic inhabited by a population of 51,540 (2019), whose history dates back to the Viking period. Greenland is located between the Arctic and Atlantic oceans and the largest non-continental island in the world. Three quarters of Greenland is covered by a permanent ice sheet and its population of 55,877 (estimate 2018) makes it the least densely populated territory in the world."
europe,united-kingdom,"Despite its small size, England remains stubbornly impossible to encapsulate in a neat sound bite. It's a delectable mosaic of cultures, cities and landscapes, and any holiday in England will add up to an experience that's much more than the sum of its parts. Even the weather - despite many perceive that it rains a lot here, many cities across England are actually drier than a number of major European cities. Take London for example; Greenwich in London receives less average precipitation a year than Amsterdam, Hamburg and Paris; a fact that is hardly known. So England will have you doing an about-face on this and every other stereotype. Come expecting a nation of tea drinkers and pub goers, antiquated traditions and Sunday roasts – and leave knowing there's so much more to it than that. When it comes to cities, London hardly requires an introduction because its reputation as a global cultural heavyweight is well-established, although England's regional cities warrant further attention. Though woven together by a shared history, these vibrant metropolises have fiercely individual characters and continue to make indelible marks on the fabric of this nation – and indeed the rest of the world. The old industrial powerhouses of Birmingham, Liverpool and Manchester have made outstanding contributions to music (think Black Sabbath, The Beatles, Oasis) and continue to punch above their weight culturally. And then there are the grandiose seats of learning, Oxford and Cambridge, where medieval architecture and cobbled streets evoke a powerful sense of history at every turn. England's eccentricities can bewilder (as a visit to the annual cheese rolling competition in Gloucestershire will prove), but despite the odd clash between tradition and modernity, the two make comfortable bedfellows. Visit England and you'll see a place where liberal values have fostered a culture of tolerance and diversity, where self-deprecation is the modus operandi and where witty words beat correct answers almost every time. It's a country that rewards the curious, whether that means ducking into a pub for a chat with the locals or heading out into the wilds. Speaking of the wilds, England's landscapes have it all: from the dramatic dales of Yorkshire and the rugged fells of the Lake District, to the bucolic hills of the Cotswolds and Cornwall's dramatic coast.

The Romans first attempted to conquer Britannia (as they knew it) in 55 BC but it wasn't until 43 AD that Claudius successfully led an invasion. Within years the Romans ruled the land, setting up cities, roads and spas. However, by the 5th century the Roman Empire withdrew from Britain, leaving the way clear for an influx of Anglo-Saxons and, later, Vikings. The Norman Conquest, initially marked by the Battle of Hastings in 1066, caused many Anglo-Saxons to flee. The Normans carried out a huge census of England, documented in the Domesday Book. Of the many royal houses that subsequently ruled, it was arguably the Tudors in the 1500s that had the most profound impact. King Henry VIII broke away from Catholicism and created the Church of England, essentially in order to be granted a divorce. This decision had huge implications for England’s future and led to prolonged religious tensions. Around a century later, the English Civil War saw dividing lines drawn up again, this time between parliamentary forces and royalist supporters. The war led to King Charles I's execution and left a framework for rule by parliamentary democracy, which remains today. By the early 20th century the British Empire had become the largest in the world, with numerous overseas colonies. The onset of WWI and WWII signalled change, and by the 1950s Britain had begun to divest itself of its colonies. Post-war Britain looked very different, as many women came into the workforce for the first time. Significant social change also brought free healthcare, better housing and more access to education. In the 'swinging 60s', London caught world attention through its music, fashion and culture as Twiggy, The Beatles and the Rolling Stones made headlines. Tory Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher was a divisive figure in the 1980s, polarising opinion with her measures to tackle England's economic woes. Tony Blair's Labour party came to power in 1997 promising change, but his tenure was tarnished by his support of a US-led war with Iraq. The last decade has seen a shifting political and economic landscape, with the effects of the global financial crisis still reverberating. In 2016, England voted to leave the EU in a referendum colloquially known as Brexit. The process divides the country but is still undergoing. Did you know? •	Only six people died in the Great Fire of London in 1666. •	The Cornish pasty is said to be worth £300m annually to the Cornish economy. •	London was reportedly the first city on the planet to reach a population of one million, a figure it reached in 1811. •	The Liverpool and Manchester Railway, which opened in 1830, was the first fully timetabled rail service in the world. Predominantly Christian (Church of England, Roman Catholic, Presbyterian, Methodist), sizeable Muslim, Sikh, Jewish and Hindu minorities. There is also a large number of agnostics and atheists. The monarchy, though now only symbolic politically, is a powerful and often subconscious unifying force. Members of the Royal Family are the subjects of unceasing fascination, with their every move avidly followed and reported by the popular press, both in the UK and abroad. Handshaking is customary when introduced to someone for the first time. Normal social courtesies should be observed when visiting someone's home and a small present such as flowers or chocolates is appreciated. It is polite to wait until everyone has been served before eating. When dining, it is considered rude to slurp food, eat noisily or make noise with cutlery. Clothing: Some nightclubs and restaurants do not allow jeans and trainers, otherwise casual wear is widely acceptable. Use of public places: Topless sunbathing is allowed on certain beaches and tolerated in some parks. Smoking is banned in all enclosed public places, including stations, pubs and restaurants, throughout the UK. English. There are many local dialects throughout the country, influenced by class, and town and country accents. In the larger cities, particularly London, there are many communities who do not speak English as a first language, or who speak patois.","The weather in England is temperate with mild summers and winters, influenced by the Atlantic Ocean and the warm Gulf Stream. Rainfall is fairly evenly spread throughout the year, though the west is wetter than the east. Contrary to the stereotype, most cities across England actually have less average precipitation than other European cities. England is a population destination year-round with many attractions and activities to occupy you whatever the season, although spring (March to May) and autumn (September to November) are widely considered to be the best time to visit England due to the mild weather and sunny days. Summer (June to August) in England is lovely but can crowded, particularly in popular holidaying spots such as Brighton, Devon and Cornwall. Winter (December to February) tends to be grey and wet. Snow is rare, which is why a cold snap with a small amount of snow can cause problems with transport and infrastructure. As most cities decked out in exuberant lights leading up to Christmas, December is a good month to visit too. London is the capital and the largest city in England. Located in south England, London has a temperate oceanic climate and is one of the warmest places in the UK due to the heat stored in buildings and pavement. Greenwich, an area within London, enjoys an average high of 8°C (46°F) in January and 23°C (74°F) in July. It also receives an average precipitation of 557 mm (22 in) a year. In comparison, the average precipitation received by Amsterdam and Paris is 805mm (32 in) and 641mm (25 in) respectively. For more information, see this Weather in London and the best time to visit guide. Manchester, located about 260km (160 miles) northwest of London, is a few degrees cooler than London. In July, the average high is 21°C (70°F) while the average low is 14°C (57°F). The weather in England is mild and temperatures do cool down considerably in the evenings, so a light jacket is always useful. Thunderstorm doesn't happen often, though it may drizzle on and off, so a rain jacket and appropriate footwear are useful too. During summer, shorts, sandals and t-shirts are fine, but bring extra layers as weather can be changeable. Do layer up if you are travelling beyond London, particularly to the north as it is always a few degrees cooler than London. Mainland England makes up almost half of the British Isles. There are also several small islands including the Isle of Wight and the Isles of Scilly both of which lie off the south coast. In the south, much of the landscape is made up of undulating green hills given over to agriculture, with the South Downs and Cotswolds being prime examples of this. The east and north of England is flat and low lying – most notably in the east are the Fens, flat marshland that surrounds the East Anglian towns of Cambridge and Peterborough. The coastline is endlessly varied, with northern England's coast made up mainly of flat sand dunes, whereas the south is notable for the Jurassic Coast of Dorset, a World Heritage site where the cliffs span 153km (95 miles) and 185 million years of history, and numerous fossil discoveries have been made. Further north, the landscape becomes more dramatic. The mountain ranges of the Yorkshire Dales and Lake District in the northwest afford picturesque views of valleys, lakes, forest and mountains, making both destinations popular with hikers. The Pennine mountain range (also known as the 'backbone of England') bisects the northern region, creating a natural divide between the North West and North East. Traversed by the Pennine Way, the UK's longest footpath, hikers can get up close to one of the most scenic in England and take in one of the most scenic parts of England."
europe,estonia,"From reluctant Soviet state to one of the European Union's brightest young stars, Estonia has undergone something of a transformation in recent decades – and finally the world has woken up to its many charms. The smallest and arguably most scenic of the three Baltic states (which also includes Latvia and Lithuania), Estonia is a wildly beautiful land of pristine forests, biodiverse wetlands and remote offshore islands; its natural assets offer a spectacular contrast to the brooding, gothic aesthetic of its medieval capital, Tallinn. In Tallinn, the cobbled streets are peppered with historic churches, monuments and cosy cafés, not to mention a burgeoning restaurant scene that pays homage to the country's Baltic and Nordic heritage. The nightlife is pretty lively too, which has made it a popular destination for stag parties, although not everybody has welcomed that. Most adventure travellers escape the city and make for the primeval forests and lakes of rural Estonia. And who can blame them? These areas offer landscapes and ecosystems which have, for the most part, been lost in much of Europe. More than 1,000 lakes shimmer in the Estonian countryside, while bogs and swamplands cover an astounding one-fifth of the country. These habitats are a haven for birds and birdwatchers. Estonia's natural wonders are on impressive display in its national parks; most notably, Soomaa, in the heart of the country, and Lahemaa, on the northern coast, which rewards visitors with challenging hikes and impressive views of the Baltic Klint, a 1,200km-long (745 mile) ridge of limestone cliffs that stretches from Sweden to Russia. Elusive wolves, bears and lynxes can also be spotted in these parts. Estonia's history, like that of its Baltic neighbours, has been almost singly devoted to maintaining independence from its powerful neighbours, most notably Russia. Annexed by Stalin in 1944, Estonia never entirely became the Soviet republic it might have done, retaining its language and culture far more strongly than other members of the USSR. This plucky, independent spirit endures in Estonia today. 45,228 sq km (17,462 sq miles). 1,251,171 (UN estimate 2017). 30 per sq km. Tallinn. Republic. President Alar Karis since 2021. Prime Minister Kaja Kallas since 2021.","The Vikings passed through the Baltic in the ninth century and over the next few centuries, Denmark, Germany, Russia, Sweden and Poland all fought to control Estonia. In the 13th century, Estonia was ruled by the Livonia Order, an autonomous branch of the Teutonic Order but became a part of Sweden after the Livonian War of 1558-1583. It remained in the Swedish hand until 1710 when Sweden ceded Estonia to Russia following the Great Northern War of 1700-1721. The Russian period from 1750 to 1840 was particularly noted for the Estophile Enlightenment Period where German elites and other non-Estonians became interested in Estonian language, literature and culture. Following the Russian revolutions of 1917 and World War I (1914-1918), Estonia attained its independence in 1918. The new Soviet government at first refused to recognise Estonian independence, but soon gave way. In 1940, under the Nazi-Soviet Pack of 1939, the Soviet Union occupied Estonia once again but barely 12 months later, Estonia was conquered by Nazi Germany. In 1944 the Red Army retook the country, after which Estonia was constituted as one of the 15 Soviet Socialist Republics. Four decades passed before the advent of Mikhail Gorbachev who, as Communist Party General Secretary, offered the prospect of change for the Baltic States. A key part of the economic reform programme was the devolution of power to the republics and Estonia led the way among the Baltic states. Measures to establish an Estonian currency and to restore Estonian as the official language quickly followed. In 1990, the Estonian Communist Party voted in favour of full independence from the Soviet Union. Rapid international recognition of Estonia as a sovereign state, followed by admission to the United Nations, completed the transition to full nationhood in 1991. In 2004, Estonia joined NATO and the EU. Did you know? • The medieval old town of Tallinn is on the UNESCO World Heritage List. • The sport of Kiiking was invented in Estonia in 1996 by Ado Kosk. It involves a swing on which the rider attempts to go round 360 degrees. • The epic folk poem Kalevipoeg, composed from oral legends by Friedrich Reinhold Kreutzwald around 1853, is the national story of Estonia. Kreutzwald is considered the father of Estonian literature. Estonia is one of the least religious countries in the world, with only 14% of the population declaring religion to be an important part of their daily life. Estonians are generally quite reserved and polite. A hand shake is the customary greeting. Normal courtesies should be observed. The Estonians are proud of their culture and their national heritage, and visitors should take care to respect this. Estonian is the official language but many Estonians speak very good English, while older people also speak some Russian.","Located in the northern part of the temperate climate zone and influenced by the Atlantic Ocean and Baltic Sea, Estonia has four distinct seasons with July being the warmest month and February the coldest. Rainfall is moderately low throughout the year, but falling frequently in summer and autumn. Spring (March to May) sees water levels rise due to snow melts, flooding low-lying lands and giving keen canoers access to places that are otherwise accessible by foot. In Tallinn, the average temperatures rise gradually from -1°C (30°F) in March to 11°C (52°F) in May. Summer (June to August) is the best time to visit Estonia as visitors can enjoy warm days and a string of festivals. However, do bring a raincoat as summer can be wet with frequent showers. In some coastal areas, visitors get to enjoy 19 hours of daylight in June. Autumn (September to November) sees many gloomy days and frequent rainfall. September is still a good time to visit Estonia but by November, the weather turns cold and wet with temperatures averaging just 1°C (34°F). Winter (December to February) is cold and snowy, particularly in the southwest where the warm sea current does not quite reach. Despite cold, Tallinn is most atmospheric with the Christmas Market sparkles in the charming Old Town. Lighter clothes are worn during the summer months, although a jacket is advisable in the evening. Wrap up warm if you're visiting during the winter months. Check the climate of the specific area you intend to travel to as winter temperatures vary greatly between the coast and inland. Estonia is the most northerly of the three Baltic Republics and is bordered to the north and west by the Baltic Sea, to the east by the Russian Federation and to the south by Latvia. The country is one of great scenic beauty with many forests, more than 1,400 lakes and 1,500 islands. Smaller than Lithuania and Latvia, it has nevertheless the longest coastline of all the Baltic States."
europe,finland,"Finland is the big surprise of the Nordic countries, a natural wonderland with over 179,000 islands and more trees than people. With miles of empty wilderness, the Finns are uniquely in tune with their natural surroundings. This is a nation where people can flip from office work to foraging for wild mushrooms in a heartbeat. The culture of the Finns has been shaped by the historic tug-of-war between Sweden and Russia, leaving dotted enclaves such as Russian-tinted Karelia, and the Swedish-speaking regions of Åland and Ostrobothnia. Even the Finnish language is an anomaly, curiously related to Hungarian. For most, the gateway to Finland is Helsinki. A friendly and surprisingly small capital city, here historic churches rise above tidy public squares and stone wharfs are crowded with market traders and ferryboats. It’s probably the best place to encounter Finland’s famous party spirit, especially during the light nights of midsummer. Vast areas are protected by Finland's 40 national parks, providing fantastic opportunities to spot birds, reindeer, elks and bears. Around 10% of Finland is covered by water and 75% of the country is covered by forests, providing a natural adventure playground for trekkers, mountain-bikers, cross-country skiers, dog-sledders, as well as fishing and watersports enthusiasts. No wonder sisu (meaning ‘hardiness’) is seen as integral to the Finnish character. The cosmopolitan south, with its bustling cities and sleek, modern design sensibilities (this is, after all, the home of Alvar Aalto and Marimekko) seems a long way from rugged Lapland, where the Sámi people have been herding reindeer for millennia. For tourism purposes, Lapland is also the home of Father Christmas, ensuring a busy Christmas season at the Santa theme park near Rovaniemi. Perhaps Finland's most famous contribution to world culture is the sauna – with an estimated 2 million of them, there are more saunas than cars in Finland. Enjoying a visit to the sauna, ideally after a bracing dip in a wilderness lake, is practically mandatory for all visitors. 338,145 sq km (130,558 sq miles). 5,532,365 (UN estimate 2016). 16.2 per sq km. Helsinki. Republic. President Cai-Göran Alexander Stubb since 2024. Prime Minister Sanna Marin since 2019.","Finland’s first settlers lived in the region around 120,000-130,000 years ago. During the Iron Age, the land was inhabited by the Finnish Proper, Tavastian, Karelian, and Sámi cultures. The settlers spoke dialects belonging to the Finno-Ugric group (except Sámi who speak several distinct Uralic languages), quite different from the Indo-European languages spoken throughout most of the rest of Europe. After centuries of violent conflict in the region, Finland ended up under Swedish rule around the 14th Century until 1809 when Alexander I of Russia invaded. Finland became a Grand Duchy of Russia and the capital was moved from Turku to Helsinki, closer to St. Petersburg and further away from Swedish influence. The period of Russian rule was marked by famine – the 1866-1868 famine killed 15% of the population in Finland – but also a strong nationalist movement, popular after the national epic Kalevala was compiled from folk stories dating back thousands of years. Progressive movements like women’s suffrage gained traction quickly; Finland was the first country in the world to implement full universal suffrage in 1906. In the following year the Finnish people elected the world’s first female members of parliament. In 1917, Finland finally gained independence from Russia. Under the Paris Peace Treaties 1947, the Finns were forced to cede most of their Karelian territory to the USSR and pay reparations, resulting in more than 400,000 Karelian refugees being displaced. Since the fall of the Soviet Union there has been some debate over whether Russia should return Karelia to Finland, but this has not yet led to any formal discussions between the two powers. Since joining the EU in 1995, the focus in Helsinki has switched towards Europe, and also the development of relations with the newly independent Baltic states of the former USSR, with whom there are cultural and linguistic links. For decades, Finnish domestic politics was dominated by the Social Democratic Party (SDP) and the Centre Party (known as 'Kesk'), which led a long series of coalition governments. In recent years, however, the political landscape in Finland has shifted, with the emergence of the right-wing National Coalition Party (Kokoomus, referred to as 'Kok') and the populist far-right ‘True Finns’ party, both of whom entered a coalition alongside the Centre Party in 2015, booting the long-standing SDP’s into opposition. Social Democrat Tarja Halonen, Finland’s first female president, took office at the beginning of 2000 and remained there until 2012. National Coalition Party’s Sauli Niinistö took over the role has since taken over the role. Did you know? •	Finland has the highest number of heavy metal bands per capita in the world. There are around 2,800 heavy metal bands in Finland. •	Another thing Finland has in abundance? Saunas. It is estimated there are around two million of them serving a population of 5.5 million – that’s more than one for every three people. •	The average Finnish person consumes 12kg of coffee per year (compared to an annual world average of around 1.3kg per person). They also drink more milk per capita than anywhere else in the world. 70.9% Lutheran, 1% Finnish Orthodox; there are also Baptists, Methodists, Free Church, Roman Catholics, Jews and Muslims. 26.3% of the population are unaffiliated with any religion. If invited to someone's house for dinner, lateness (over 10 minutes) is seen as a discourtesy. Shoes are always removed before entering the house and a gift for the host, such as a bottle of wine or a bunch of flowers, is well received. Shoes should be removed when entering someone's home. Shaking hands is customary as a greeting and guests are expected to refrain from drinking until the host or hostess toasts their health with kippis (Finnish) or skål (Swedish). When toasting, make eye contact with everyone around the table, and take a sip of your drink; shots of liquor are not expected to downed all-in-one. Do expect your glass to be refilled frequently by the host or hostess. Most Finns prefer practical, casual clothing, except for special occasions. ‘Alternative’ fashion, piercings and tattoos are popular among younger Finns; not surprising for a country where heavy metal bands top the charts regularly. Although renowned for their liberal attitudes, Finns can appear to be rather reserved with strangers, so do not be alarmed if conversations start slowly. This sense of composure will often disappear after a few drinks, or in the sauna. There are two official languages: Finnish, mother tongue for 91.6% of the population, and Swedish, first language of 5.5% of the population. Swedish Finns have a distinct cultural identity and often speak English more fluently than they speak Finnish. The Finnish language is related to only Estonian and Hungarian. Around 2,000 people in Lapland speak one of the dialects of the Sámi language, while Karelian dialects still survive amongst older people in the east of the country.

Summer is Jun-Aug, winter is Nov-Mar, but snow in Lapland can start around October and linger until May. July temperatures average 21°C (70°F) in the capital Helsinki and 20°C (68°F) in Rovaniemi. 86. In the far south there is no midnight sun, but around 19 hours of daylight in the summer. In Lapland you can expect midnight sun for up to 2 months. January temperatures average -7°C (20°F) in Helsinki and -15°C (5°F) in Rovaniemi. Keep in mind that the record low temperatures range from -35°C to -45°C (-31°F to -40°F) regardless of region, and recent years have seen particularly cold winters. Around midwinter the sun will not rise in Lapland, perfect for spotting the northern lights. Further south there will be about 6 hours of daylight during the winter months. Rainfall is distributed fairly evenly throughout the year in the south, with an average of around 18 days of rainfall in Helsinki per month. The north may be drier, but also particularly plagued by gnats and mosquitoes. In summer, travellers can get away with lightweight clothing in the daytime, but long sleeves and long trousers or skirts may be more comfortable for the evening. Waterproof clothes are useful throughout the year. If you are hiking through forests, wear waterproof boots, long sleeves and trousers to protect against mosquitoes and ticks. In Lapland you will need insect repellent. In winter, bring appropriate clothing for snowy conditions, including wool under-layers and socks (not cotton) as well as snow boots with a good grip. In the Arctic North, you may need expedition-quality winter clothing. Towns and resorts generally offer these for hire and hotel staff can give recommendations on what you will need. With Sweden to the west, and Russia to the east, the history and politics of Finland have been shaped by its location. The national character of the Finns has been further coloured by the water-logged landscape - the country is hemmed in by the Gulf of Bothnia and the Gulf of Finland and 10% of its landmass lies underwater. Finland has over 179,000 islands, including the 98,050 islands in its 188,000 inland lakes. The Saimaa Lake system in the southeast of the country is the fourth largest lake in Europe. By European standards, Finland is very sparsely populated, and around 73% of the country is forested. In the south and southwest, the forest is mainly pine, fir and birch; in Lapland, in the far north, scattered dwarf birch forests give way to Arctic tundra. Most of the national forests are managed for timber, which is used for the manufacture of furniture, paper and fibreboards and for domestic heating and warming Finland's two million saunas. Finland's forests are said to be the most sustainably managed in Europe."
europe,france,"You could spend a lifetime's worth of holidays in France and still feel as if you hadn't done the country justice. It remains one the planet's most visited tourist destination, meriting its standing with an almost overwhelming mass of historical treasures, storybook landscapes, and cultural idiosyncrasies. The teeming glam of Paris makes for one hell of a centrepiece, matching any city on the planet for ambiance, individuality, and set-piece sights. But the real beauty of France, in many ways, lies elsewhere. The country's natural gifts are striking with white sandy beaches, hulking mountains and swathes of rolling countryside. It's a land that has inspired dreamers and drinkers, revolutionaries and artists.  You can soak up the A-list beaches of the Cote d’Azur, drowse in the timeless greenery of the Loire Valley or gaze up at the monumental peaks of the Alps. Wander the lavender fields of Provence, eat your way around the legendary bistros of Lyon or sample the rugged charm of Corsica. France's cities, coastline, and countryside all have their own endearing rewards, and when taken as a whole, they present a near-perfect visitor package. That's not to say that France is somewhere easily bracketed. When you're walking the moody portside backstreets of Marseille or delving among the sprawling flea markets of Paris, it can be a job to remember that they're all part of the same country as the vineyards of Alsace and the sand dunes of the Atlantic coast. This diversity, in many ways, is the magic of France. It's why countless magazines, books, and texts have dedicated their works to the joys of the French lifestyle. It's why the national spirit is well-known for its boldness and radiance. And it's one reason why, in a world full of historical wonder and natural beauty, France still draws more tourist attention than anywhere else. ""How can one describe a country which has 246 kinds of cheese?"" once asked former French president Charles De Gaulle. Even today, it's a very good question. 551,500 sq km (212,935 sq miles) not including overseas territories. 66.99 million (2019). 120 per sq km. Paris. Republic. President Emmanuel Macron since 2017. Prime Minister Gabriel Attal since 2024.","Prior to the French Revolution in 1789, France was a monarchy known for its colourful (and often extravagant) royals – not least Louis XIV, or the Sun King, who moved his court from Paris to Versailles in the 1680s. The revolution itself brought about a sea change in the way the whole country was structured, shifting power from the church and nobility to the state. The Napoleonic era oversaw the expansion of the French Empire, before defeat at Waterloo in 1815 which resulted in the restoration of the monarchy. Napoleon himself was exiled to a South Atlantic island, where he died. Back in France, the abdication of King Louis-Philippe in 1848 established the formation of the Second Republic, and since then, different heads of state have led the country. In the latter half of the 19th century, much of Paris' famous architecture - including its avenues of Haussmann buildings and the Eiffel Tower - was constructed. In the 20th century, France played an important role in both world wars (where notably, the country's surrender to Nazi Germany in 1940 resulted in the temporary Vichy Regime), but the post-war presidency of Charles de Gaulle restored stability. The famous anti-government protests of 1968, however, eventually led to de Gaulle's downfall. In modern times, Emmanuel Macron, the founder of a new party 'La République En Marche!' was elected president in 2017. At age 39, he became the youngest President in the history of France. His aim to reform the public sector, welfare benefits and the French pension system has been met with waves of protests - in April 2018, rail workers announced a three-month strike challenging the government's employment reforms, and from November 2018, Gilets jaunes (yellow-jacket protesters) have marched the streets in Paris and other French cities against fuel tax increase and tough austerity measures. Did you know? •	France has around 1,000 chateaux and roughly 1,600 kinds of cheese. •	In February 2016, France has become the first country in the world to ban supermarkets from throwing away or destroying unsold food. •	King Louis XIX had the shortest reign of any French monarch: 20 minutes. 63-66% Christians, 23-28% unaffiliated and 7-9% Muslims. Shaking hands and, more familiarly, kissing both cheeks, are the usual forms of greeting. The form of personal address is simply 'Monsieur' or 'Madame' without a surname and it may take time to get on first-name terms. At more formal dinners, the most important guest or host gives the signal to start eating. Mealtimes are often a long and leisurely experience. Casual wear is common but some clubs, casinos, and exclusive restaurants warrant more formal attire. Eveningwear is normally specified where required. Topless sunbathing is tolerated on most beaches but naturism is restricted to specific beaches - local tourist offices will advise where these are. A smoking ban for workplaces and public spaces has been in place since February 2007. French is the official language. There are many regional dialects, but these are rapidly declining with the exception of Basque, which is spoken as a first language by some people in the southwest. Breton is also spoken by some in Brittany. Most French can also speak English.","A popular year-round destination, France has an affable climate boasting long hot summers and cool winters, which bring snow to higher ground. Summer (June-August) is warm and sunny across much of the country; this is peak tourist season. If you're visiting at this time, prepare to face crowds at major sights, attractions, and coastal resorts, particularly along the French Riviera. Paris is best experienced in spring (March to May) as it is less crowded than summer. Visit the Weather in Paris and the best time to visit Paris guide for more information. If you like intense heat, south of France and St Tropez are sizzling hot in June, July and August. Spring (March-May) and autumn (September-October) are decidedly quieter; prices are also considerably cheaper. Bordeaux is one of France's most popular wine regions and the largest growing wine region in the country. Autumn is the best time to visit as the days are warm and the nights are cooler, plus there are plenty of wine harvest festivals. May and June are also good months to visit, with pleasant weather and wildflowers in bloom. The Alps & Pyrenees draw the crowds during the ski season (December-March) as they fill up the resorts, ready for skiing and winter sports activities. Avid hikers take to the mountains in early June to trek the beautiful trails, lined with wildflowers. Northeastern areas have warm summers and colder winters with rainfall distributed throughout the year and snowfall likely in winter. The Atlantic influences the climate of the western coastal areas from the Loire to the Basque region, where the weather is temperate and relatively mild with rainfall throughout the year. Summers here can be very hot and sunny – sunburn is a risk if you're unprepared. Provence promises one of the prettiest natural spectacles between the last week of June and the first week of August when the lavender fields in The Luberon burst into full bloom. By visiting in mid-June you'll likely miss the tourists, as mid-August is the busiest time of year. Light, breathable clothing for summer and waterproof winter gear for the mountains all year round. In winter, even the Mediterranean resorts often require a sweater or jacket for the cool evenings. France, the largest country in Western Europe, is bordered to the northwest by the English Channel (La Manche), to the northeast by Belgium and Luxembourg, to the east by Germany, Switzerland, and Italy, to the south by the Mediterranean (with Monaco as a coastal enclave between Nice and the Italian frontier), to the southwest by Spain and Andorra, and to the west by the Atlantic Ocean. The country’s loose six-sided shape means it often gets referred to by the informal nickname 'L’Hexagone'. The island of Corsica, southeast of Nice, is made up of two départements. France is home to an astonishing range of scenery, from the mountain ranges of the Alps and Pyrenees to the attractive river valleys of the Loire, Rhône, and Dordogne, and the flatter countryside of Normandy and the Atlantic coast. The country has some 2,900km (1,800 miles) of coastline. Away from the mainland and Corsica, there are several French-administered overseas departments and regions outside of Europe. These include Guadeloupe an island in the Caribbean; Réunion Island, located in the Indian Ocean just east of Madagascar; French Guiana, on the northeastern coast of South America; Martinique, another island in the Caribbean and Mayotte, an island in the Mozambique Channel."
europe,georgia,"It’s extremely easy to love Georgia. Formerly famed as the holiday haunt of the privileged elite of the Soviet Union, today’s country is an often overlooked but deeply rewarding travel destination. A location at the historical crossroads of Europe, Asia, Russia and the Middle East means it still draws influences from all four, and the end result is a heady one. From its mountain-perched monasteries to its valley-floor vineyards, and from its Turkish-style food to its remarkable capacity for hospitality to strangers, Georgia represents a very special slice of the Caucasus. Capital city Tbilisi, spread along the banks of the Mktvari River, is an enjoyable but sometimes jumbled mix of old and new. Incense-fogged churches and traditional bathhouses share the city with broad avenues and gleaming new towers, while crowning the skyline is a huge statue of “Mother Georgia” – holding a sword in one hand to ward off enemies, and a goblet of wine in the other to welcome friends. It’s a sign of how tumultuous the country’s history has been, although it’s also worth pointing out that travellers and visitors fall firmly into the “friends” camp. Georgia, incidentally, claims to be the birthplace of wine – viticulture has been practiced here for more than 6,000 years. Elsewhere in the country, highlights include the remote uplands of Svaneti, the relaxed Black Sea resort of Batumi, the spectacular hiking and horse-trekking trails of Tusheti and the tangled historical web of second city Kutaisi. Talking of tangled, the Georgian alphabet at times resembles a thicket of twisted fish-hooks, and its presence on everything from street placards to the endless marshrutkas (minibuses) that ply the roads adds an extra sense of foreignness to travel here. Georgia is an endlessly absorbing destination, a beautiful and beguiling nation made all the more rewarding by its bottomless hospitality and friendly inhabitants. 69,700 sq km (26,911 sq miles). 3,971,368 (UN estimate 2016). 70.7 per sq km.

Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze since February 2024.","Georgia’s history has been a constant struggle for survival against the aggression of powerful neighbours, interspersed with brief interludes of peace. Georgia's power and influence reached an apex during the late-12th and early-13th centuries under Queen Tamar. The Mongol invasions from 1220 onwards brought this 'golden age' to an end. At the end of the 18th century, King Erekle II forged a vital alliance with Catherine the Great of Russia but the royal lineage was deposed by the Russians in 1801, after which the whole region was steadily absorbed into the Russian Empire. Georgia briefly gained independence from 1918, until the invasion of the Red Army in 1921. Although Soviet leader Joseph Stalin was himself a Georgian (his real name was Djugashvili), the republic suffered terribly during the purges of the 1930s and 40s. It is estimated that 10 per cent of the population perished between 1940 and 1945. Nonetheless, many Georgians continue to this day to idolise their most notorious son. Agitation mounted steadily from the late 1970s until 1989 when, in an episode that was to trigger the final disillusionment with Soviet power, 20 people (most of them women) were killed and hundreds more injured when Soviet troops attacked a nationalist demonstration in Tbilisi. In a referendum held in April 1991, an overwhelming majority voted in favour of independence from the Soviet Union. Zviad Gamsakhurdia was brought to power in May, but his chaotic government ended within months. In March 1992, former Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze was appointed and, after two terms in office, was replaced by Mikheil Saakashvili in 2004 as Chairman of the National Parliament. The past two decades have been dominated by conflict with breakaway nations South Ossetia and Abkhazia. In 1994, after two years of sporadic fighting, South Ossetia was brought back under Georgian control, but violence flared again in 2008 into a full-scale war following claims and counter claims of attacks. Russia sent its troops to defend the breakaway region while also moving is forces into Abkhazia, and has since recognised both as independent states. Christian majority, mainly Georgian Orthodox church. Also Eastern Orthodox, Muslim, Jewish and other Christian denomination minorities. Georgians pride themselves on their reputation for gregariousness and hospitality. Visitors sitting in restaurants are likely to be offered drinks by complete strangers. They will then be invited to raise (and empty) their glasses in response to an endless string of elaborate toasts, preferably interpolating a few suitably enthusiastic toasts of their own into the sequence. Smoking is widespread. Visitors may also be entertained in private homes. On such occasions, gifts such as chocolates, flowers or alcohol are well received. On social occasions foreign women will find themselves the object of immense flattery. Those finding such attentions oppressive should avoid giving any hint of encouragement. Appropriate clothing should be worn when entering a church; visitors should ensure they are not wearing shorts and women should cover their heads. Visitors should also be aware that street crime is far from uncommon. Anyone travelling in the republic should be cautious when venturing out after dark, carry as few valuables as possible, and beware of the risk of being robbed and possibly attacked. The official language is Georgian, the only language in the Ibera Caucasian family written in ancient script, with its own unique alphabet. Russian, Armenian, Azeri, Ossetian and Abkhazian are also spoken.","Georgia has hot summers with mild winters, particularly in the southwest. Low temperatures are common in alpine areas. Heavist rainfall exists in the subtropical southwest. The best time to visit Georgia is in early-summer (May and June) and early-autumn (September), when temperatures are mild without the humidity and heat associated with July and August. Georgia is a mountainous country bordered by the Russian Federation in the north, Turkey in the southeast, Armenia in the south, Azerbaijan in the east and by the Black Sea in the west, which forms a 330km-long (206 miles) coastline. It includes the two autonomous republics Abkhazia and Ajaria. The state is crossed by the ranges of the Greater Caucasus (highest peak: Mt Kazbek, 5,047m/16,554ft). Enclosed high valleys, wide basins, health spas with famous mineral waters, caves and waterfalls combine in this land of varied landscapes and striking beauty."
europe,germany,"Misunderstood by many, Germany is one of the most varied and charming countries on the continent. Anyone expecting a homogenous nation conforming to old Teutonic stereotypes is in for a shock. As a destination, it offers a clutch of truly lovely cities, culture served up in hefty portions and rural scenery so pretty you'll wonder why it isn't on every tourist hit list. The country occupies a prime position at the heart of Europe – both literally and figuratively. It is home to the biggest economy on the continent, has more inhabitants than anywhere else in the EU and shares land borders with no less than nine other nations. It's no surprise, then, that today's Germany is more diverse and cosmopolitan than old stereotypes suggest; mixing time-honoured traditions with multicultural modernism and self-confidence. It’s the nation’s urban highlights that immediately draw the attention. Berlin is the definition of dynamism, having forged a good-time reputation for groundbreaking creativity while still keeping sight of its past. Elsewhere, the likes of Cologne, Munich and Hamburg provide the capital with able support. Not only are they rich in history, whether in the forms of classical music, fine art or medieval architecture, but they also put pay to the notion that Germans don’t do gastronomy. These days, you can dine and drink extremely well in Deutschland. Then there's the beautiful German countryside. From the sky-scraping peaks of the Bavarian Alps and pale cliffs of the Jasmund National Park to the castles of the Rhine and moors of the Mecklenburg Lake District, it's nirvana for hikers, cyclists, boaters, motorists and skiers alike. Travelling around this country is a piece of Black Forest gâteau. Costs are manageable, overcrowding is rare and, despite its size, it could not be easier to get from A to B thanks to an incredibly efficient public transport network. Which proves some of those old German stereotypes do hold true. 357,022 sq km (137,846 sq miles). 82,293,457 (2018). 236 per sq km. Berlin. Federal Republic. President Frank-Walter Steinmeier since 2017. Chancellor Olaf Scholz since December 2021.","The territory that we now know as Germany was for many centuries a loose collection of independent (and often warring) states, occupied by rulers including the Roman Empire, the Holy Roman Empire and the Austrian Habsburgs. Unification was attained after a victory in the Franco-Prussian war of 1871. There followed a period of political, military and economic advancement that placed it as a genuine world power. Following defeat in WWI, however, the Treaty of Versailles saw the country sliced and diced. Germany was forced to cede parts of its territory to surrounding nations as well as to pay significant reparations – a punishment that would prove crippling for the already ailing German economy. It was these dire economic circumstances, amplified by the worldwide economic Depression of 1929 and a growing tide of racism in Europe that gave rise to the emergence of the National Socialist German Workers' (Nazi) Party, making Adolf Hitler head of state. His notorious legacy remains a shocking historical blight. Initial military success in WWII ended in further defeat for Germany, although this time, the country's economy recovered more quickly. After the war, Germany's borders were once again redrawn, and the country and its capital city, Berlin, were divided. For more than 40 years, the communist East Germany was cut off from the US-allied West. In 1989, the Berlin Wall, which separated the eastern districts of the city from the west, started to be dismantled. Reunification took place shortly after in October 1990. From 1995 onwards, a new leadership under would-be chancellor Gerhard Schröder emerged to challenge the long-standing Helmut Kohl Christian Democrat (CDU) government. Schröder came to power in 1998, his reign coming to an end amid confusion following September 2005's inconclusive election. Germany faced weeks of uncertainty resulting in a deal that saw Angela Merkel sworn in as Germany's first female chancellor. Since then, Merkel has guided Germany through the global recession, helping to ensure a quick recovery for the country with stimulus packages. In 2013, she was sworn in for her third four-year term and in 2014, Merkel became the longest serving incumbent head of state in the European Union. In 2018, Merkel announced that her current term will be the last one as a political leader. Did you know? • Germans take their downtime very seriously, which is why shopping on Sunday is strictly forbidden, except for special occasions like leading up to Christmas in certain cities. • Ordering a beer at a bar in Germany? If you don't want to give away your non-native status, be sure to use your thumb to indicate that you want one drink rather than your index finger. • Oktoberfest, Munich's world-famous beer festival, actually begins in September. Approximately 28% Roman Catholic, 26% Protestant, 5% Muslim, with Jewish and other non-Christian minorities. Over one third of the population is atheistic. Handshaking is customary, and it is considered rude to address people by their first name unless invited to do so. Normal courtesies should be observed. Before eating, it is normal to say ""guten Appetit"" to the other people at the table to which the correct reply is ""Danke, gleichfalls"" (“Thank you, the same to you”). If you’ve been invited to eat at a German house, it is customary to present the hostess with unwrapped flowers (according to tradition, you should always give an uneven number, and it is worth noting that red roses are exclusively a lover's gift). In shops and other businesses, courtesy dictates that visitors should utter a greeting such as ""guten Tag"" (or ""grüß Gott"" in Bavaria) before saying what it is that they want; to leave without saying ""auf Wiedersehen"" or ""tschüss"" can also cause offence. Similarly, when making a telephone call, asking for the person you want to speak to without stating first who you are is impolite. Casual wear is widely acceptable, but more formal dress is required for some restaurants, the opera, theatre, casinos and important social functions. Smoking is prohibited where notified and on public transport and in most public buildings. German is the official language. Regional dialects often differ markedly from standard German.

Its climate, however, varies little from north to south. Most of Germany has a temperate seasonal climate moderated by the North Atlantic Drift. Overall, Germany is a year-round destination with warm summers and relatively cold winters – although prolonged period of frost is rare. Rain falls throughout the year, with much of Germany experiencing its maximum rainfall over the high summer months. The highest annual temperatures tend to be in the southwest, where there's almost a Mediterranean feel to the landscape at times and where new heat records are reached almost every year. Unsurprisingly, this is where much of Germany's wine is grown. May through to September are the most popular months in terms of tourist numbers, and certainly hold the most appeal for visitors aiming to spend significant periods of time outdoors. However, April and October (the shoulder months) also hold real attraction for those who want the promise of mild weather without the tourist levels. The winter holidays are also a big draw in their way, as tourists flock to charming Christmas markets scattered across the country. Peak season for ski areas is from December through to the end of March. Berlin is the capital and the largest city in Germany. Geographically it sits in north-eastern Germany and has a temperate continental climate. Berlin's summer is warm with average high temperatures of 23°C (73°F). June and August are rainy too so pack a raincoat with you. Berlin's winter is quite mild with average high temperatures of 3°C (37°F). Home to world-renowned attractions, Berlin rarely witnesses 'slow' periods at any time of year, though prices tend to be slightly higher over the summer months. For more information, see the weather in Berlin and the best time to go guide. Located in west Germany in the Rhine-Ruhr area, Cologne is one of the warmest cities in Germany due to its low lying position. Spring and autumn are the best times to visit Cologne with temperatures averaging 14°C (57°F) in May and 15°C (59°F) in September. The city is aswarm with visitors during ""Crazy Days"" (before Shrove Thursday which falls in February or March) where people dress up and participate in balls and parades. For more information, see the weather in Cologne and the best time to go guide. Frankfurt is Germany's hub for commerce and transportation. The city occupies both sides of the Main River and is a year-round destination known for its trade fairs. Summer is warm with average high temperatures of 25°C (77°F). Winter is mild, although it can often get to -1°C (30°F) in the evening. For more information, see the weather in Frankfurt and the best time to go guide. Hamburg is a major port city in northern Germany with a maritime temperate climate. Due to its location, Hamburg is slightly cooler than Berlin which is about 500km (311 miles) south. August is the warmest month and sees an average high of just 22°C (72°F), while winter is cold (although it is also getting milder with less snowfall due to global warming). The daily mean in January is 1°C (34°F). For more information, see the weather in Hamburg and the best time to go guide.

If you intend to visit the mountains or if you plan a long-distance hike, then pack waterproof gear and extra layers with you, no matter what the time of year. Germany borders Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Luxembourg, The Netherlands, Poland and Switzerland. The northwest has a coastline on the North Sea while the Baltic coastline in the northeast stretches from the Danish to the Polish border. The country is divided into 16 states (Bundesländer) and has an exceedingly varied landscape. In what was once known as West Germany, the Rhine, Bavaria and the Black Forest stand as the three most famous features, while in the east, the country is lake-studded with undulating lowlands. River basins extend over a large percentage of the region, and some of Europe’s most prominent rivers flow through the country. These include the Elbe, the Danube and the Rhine. The highest point in the country is the 2,962m (9,718ft) peak of Zugspitze Mountain in the Bavarian Alps. Cable cars run to the summit – it can also be climbed."
europe,gibraltar,"Gibraltar is full of surprises: from its lively population of Barbary macaques (monkeys) to its sub-tropical climate, this little British enclave on the Mediterranean is awash with wonders. The Rock, as Gibraltar is known, is a monolithic peninsula riddled with curious caves and tunnels. Atop its limestone base thrives unique vegetation and many species of migrating birds, which combined with glorious views and stimulating walks make Gibraltar a popular destination for nature enthusiasts. The town itself is densely concentrated on the western side of the rock; those with an interest in history should visit the Gibraltar Museum for an insight into Gibraltar's heritage of Moorish, Spanish and British rulers, while foodies will enjoy sampling fresh seafood and colourful Spanish dishes. 6.8 sq km (2.6 sq miles). 32,373 (UN estimate 2016). 4,179.7 per sq km. Gibraltar. Self-governing British Overseas Territory. HM King Charles III since 2022, represented locally by Governor Sir David Steel since 2020. Chief Minister Fabian Picardo since 2011.","Gibraltar derives its name from Gibel Tariq (Tariq's Mountain), which is named after Tariq Ibn Zeyad who led the eighth-century conquest of Spain by a combined force of Arabs and Berbers crossing from Africa. Gibraltar's unusual status was not acquired until almost 1000 years later, long after the Islamic invaders had been driven out by the Spanish, as a consequence of the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht which brought to an end the War of the Spanish Succession and gave the territory to Britain. The British interpretation of the treaty moreover, holds that the territory was ceded to them indefinitely. T he presence of a foreign-owned mini-state on the Spanish mainland has been an irritant to Anglo-Spanish relations ever since. The Spanish dictator, General Franco, launched a campaign in 1963 through the United Nations to reclaim Gibraltar, adding to the pressure by closing the border and severing telephone links. Since the death of Franco in 1975 and the return of democracy to Spain, relations between London and Madrid have improved immensely in every area - except Gibraltar. The current Spanish position was first outlined by Felipe González, Spain's Socialist premier during the 1980s, when he suggested joint Anglo-Spanish sovereignty. Successive Spanish governments, including the present Zapatero administration, have since refined the proposals, allowing for possible EU or NATO involvement. The British have no major objection, in principle, to the Spanish recovering full sovereignty over the territory - provided they are guaranteed continued access to its military base facilities. The problem is that the Gibraltarians are having none of it: no handover; no joint sovereignty; no Spanish involvement whatsoever. Domestic politics in Gibraltar are dominated by two main blocs, the ruling centre-right Social Democrats and the opposition alliance of the Socialist Labour Party and the Liberal Party. The Social Democrats formed the present government after their victory under the leadership of Peter Caruana, who was re-elected as Prime Minister for a fourth term at the most recent poll in 2007. On the issue of sovereignty, there are some differences in emphasis, but no essential difference between the basic positions of any of the three parties. Roman Catholic majority, also Church of England, Church of Scotland, Jewish, Hindu and other minorities. Gibraltar is a strongly traditional society with an attractive blend of British and Mediterranean customs. English is the official language. Most Gibraltarians are bilingual in English and Spanish.","Warm throughout the year, with hot summers and mild winters. Summer (May to September) can be very hot and humid. Gibraltar boasts around 300 day's sunshine a year. Temperatures can rise well above 30°C (86°F) between May and September. However the heat and humidity is tempered by sea breezes. Winters are mild with sunshine and temperatures around 17ºC (62°F) and with only occasional rainfall. Lightweights for summer and mediumweights for winter months. Gibraltar is a large promontory of jurassic limestone, situated in the western entrance to the Mediterranean. The rock is 5km (3 miles) long and the highest point is 426m (1,400ft) above sea level. An internal self-governing British Crown Colony, Gibraltar has given its name to the Bay and the Straits, which it overlooks. Spain is to the north and west, and Morocco is 26km (16 miles) to the south."
europe,spain,"Often described as a “miniature continent,” Gran Canaria is home to a staggering diversity of landscapes; from sweeping sandy beaches and red-earthed pine forests to undulating mountains and dusty deserts. Forming part of the Canary Islands – a Spanish archipelago floating off the coast of Western Sahara – the island has long been used as a shortcut to the sun for European holidaymakers. Cheap package deals and boozy British tourists have sullied its sunny image, but in recent years the island has been reinventing itself as a more salubrious destination. Led by the deluxe end of the market, Gran Canaria’s hotels and restaurants are experiencing something of a makeover, as the island ditches its tacky seventies aesthetic for one of retro chic and boho beau monde. Located on a nautical crossroads between Europe, Africa and the Americas, Gran Canaria was an important trading post for many centuries and has long welcomed foreign influences, which are evident in everything from local cuisine to the island’s ubiquitous Latino beats. With its year-round sunshine, most come to Gran Canaria to bathe on sweeping sandy beaches, top up on vitamin D and imbibe the island’s legendary nightlife. Others come armed with hiking boots and a desire to discover Gran Canaria’s glorious interior, which opens up to reveal some truly remarkable landscapes. The interior remains largely crowd free. Forget sprawling resorts and pumping clubs, its all boutique hotels and bucolic retreats in rural Gran Canaria, where evening entertainment revolves around games of dominoes with locals and watching the sunset over neighbouring Tenerife. There’s also the northern hinterland, which is characterised by verdant mountains, leafy gorges and quaint villages. These landscapes are an extraordinary contrast to the sandy south, where a seemingly vast desert belies the island’s diminutive size. Whether you come to party, soak up the sun or hike through the hills, it’s hard not to be charmed by Gran Canaria. The island might be a mainstream destination, but it has the capacity to surprise and that lies at the heart of its appeal. 1,560 sq km (602 sq miles). 847,830 (2015). 543.5 per sq km. Las Palmas.","Prior to the conquest of Gran Canaria by the Crown of Castille – a medieval state in the Iberian Peninsula – the island was populated by an indigenous people related to North African Berbers. Living in caves excavated from cliffs, the native Canarios had a sophisticated social hierarchy topped by two leaders who each ruled a kingdom. Many locals view the Canarios, who were decimated under early Castilian rule, as their heroic ancestors. With the Canarios conquered, the island was planted with sugar cane, a valuable commodity that brought great wealth to Gran Canaria for more than century, until it was usurped by cheaper production in the Antilles. A long period of economic depression ensued until the mid-19th century when steam ships began arriving from Britain with well-heeled Victorians looking to winter in warmer climes. In 1881, Las Palmas developed its port and thanks mainly to those British visitors it soon became the busiest in the Canary Islands. In 1821 when Tenerife was declared capital of the Canary Islands, it began to use its position to channel funding from the Spanish government into its own projects, at the expense of Gran Canaria. This led to a rift between the two islands, now best seen in rival beers and football teams. It wasn't until 1927 that Gran Canaria finally won her hard-earned billing as joint capital of the Canaries. Mass tourism began in earnest in the 1960s when the superior beaches of Gran Canaria attracted bohemians to the Maspalomas dunes. Resorts responded with the construction of grand hotels and tourism has been the mainstay of the island's economy ever since. Did you know? •	The Canary Islands boast their own sport, Canarian wrestling, which takes place at festivals. It's thought to be one of the oldest recognisable forms of wrestling. •	Despite its name, Gran Canaria is the third largest of the islands after Tenerife and Fuerteventura. •	Franco was military commander of the Canaries when the Spanish Civil War started in 1936; the plan to keep him out of the way by stationing him there didn't exactly work out – he went on to rule Spain for nearly 40 years. There is no official religion, but the majority of the population is Roman Catholic. Spanish life has undergone rapid change in recent decades and many of the stricter religious customs are giving way to more modern ways, particularly in the cities and among women. In spite of this, traditions remain strong; hospitality, chivalry and courtesy thrive. Handshaking is the customary form of greeting between men, while women to whom one has already been introduced may be greeted with a fleeting kiss to either cheek. Normal social courtesies should be observed when visiting someone's home and a small gift is always appreciated. The evening meal is taken late, generally 2100-2200. The Spanish have two family names; the maternal surname follows the paternal, but is rarely used outside a formal context. Conservative casual wear is widely acceptable. A black tie is only necessary for very formal occasions and is usually specified if required. Outside resorts, scanty beachwear should be confined to beach or poolside. Smoking has long been banned in offices, shops, schools, hospitals, cultural centres and on public transport, but in 2011 that ban was extended to all bars, cafes and restaurants. Spain now has one of the toughest anti-smoking laws in Europe.  The principal language is Spanish.","As with all the Canary Islands, the climate of Gran Canaria is as near perfect as you're likely to find anywhere in the world. Winter temperatures very rarely dip below 16°C (61°F) in winter and only occasionally rise higher than 32°C (90°F) in summer. The coolest month is January, with average daytime temperatures of 18°C (64°F). The warmest is August with an average daytime temperature of 26°C (79°F). The north of the island is slightly cooler and less arid than the south. Lightweight, plus some wind protection according to the season and a warm jacket for the occasional chilly evening in winter. Gran Canaria is the most southerly of the seven Canary Islands and lies in the Atlantic Ocean approximately 217km (135 miles) off the border between Morocco and Western Sahara, and 1,150km (715 miles) from the Iberian Peninsula. The highest point on Gran Canaria is Pico de las Nieves at 1,949m (6,394ft). Gran Canaria is made up of 21 municipalities with the capital, Las Palmas located in the North of the island. Las Palmas is the largest city in all of the Canary Islands."
europe,greece,"A flavourful melting pot of sparkling nightspots, fresh seafood, sizzling Mediterranean passion and mythical legend, Greece is a fascinating and enchanting destination. The country has long held appeal for travellers who flock to its shores to lounge on beaches, explore ancient relics and take advantage of the legendary Grecian hospitality. Yet despite its popularity, there is still an undiscovered feel to parts of Greece with Mount Olympus, the Peloponnese coast and some of the more remote islands slipping, for now at least, under the radar of mass tourism. The first port of call for most visitors is Athens, the country's stunning capital, which combines a modern centre with the stark ancient beauty of the Parthenon and a position overlooking a cerulean stretch of the Saronic Gulf. Like the rest of the country, Athens was built on a classical civilisation that produced some of the world's greatest thinkers, philosophers and poets. The ancient Greeks also brought the world democracy, which locals cheerfully remind visitors about, and a pantheon of deities, who are celebrated through statues and local folklore. Everywhere has its own legend; from the tiny island of Ithaca, home to the wanderer Odysseus, to the rugged stretch of the Peloponnese, the onetime playground of divine beings. Though the glory days of the Ancient Greeks have passed, the country remains one of Europe's leading holiday destinations, thanks largely to its gorgeous collection of islands, which are scattered like confetti across the Mediterranean Sea. Greece boasts 6,000 islands and islets in all, all of which only 277 are inhabited. Among them is Rhodes, which was home to the ancient Minoan culture and, legend has it, the terrifying Minotaur. Today it is better known for its stunning beaches, charming seaside towns and lively nightlife. The islands of Corfu, Crete and Santorini are also established hangouts for sun-seekers and merrymakers, while Kos has begun to attract deities of a very modern kind – the world’s rich and famous. Ultimately, though, in democratic Greece, everyone is welcome. 131,957 sq km (50,949 sq miles). 10,473,455 (UN estimate 2019). 81.7 per sq km. Athens. Republic.

In Athens, evidence from the Neolithic Period (before 3000 BCE) was found on wells on the slope of the Acropolis. The city flourished and expanded rapidly under Peisistratus and his sons (approximately 560-510 BCE). After the Persian Wars, Athenians rebuilt the city and became a leading city-state in Greece. In the year 507 BCE, Cleisthenes (the Athenian leader) introduced a political system that he called demokratia, or ""rule by the people"". Demo means ""the people"" while kratos means ""power"". It was the first known democracy in the world. Although this system was used for only two centuries, it paved the way for other nations to adopt respectively. The Roman came and occupied Greece from 146 BCE to 324. During this time, several of the Roman emperors were fond of Greece and embraced the Greek influence, promoting Horace to comment Graecia capta ferum victorem cepit, meaning captive Greece took captive her savage conqueror. The Byzantine Greece period started in 324 to 1453, followed by the Ottoman period from 1453 until the Greek Revolution of 1821. In 1832, Greece became an independent state and the European powers turned Greece into a monarchy, installing King Otto (from Bavaria), George I (from Denmark), and subsequently the heirs of George I ruled the nation. The last king was Constantine II when Greece (under military regime at that time) voted to abolished the monarchy in 1973. In 1981, the socialist PASOK Party won the election and ushered Greece into a period of stability. Greece joined the European Union in 1981 and adopted the euro as its currency in 2001. As a member state of the EU, Greece flourished briefly, before the 2008 economic crisis hit and from late 2009, Greece has been rescued by the EU multiple times. In 2019, there was a renewed hope that the Greek economy was recovering. But with the government owing billions to other Eurozone governments, European Central Bank and other German banks, though austerity measures are likely to stay until the debts are paid.

In summer (June to August), dry hot days are often relieved by stiff evening breezes, especially in the north, on the islands and in coastal areas. Athens can be stiflingly hot, with temperatures occasionally exceeding 40°C (104°F) in July. Winters are mild in the south but much colder in the mountainous north, where it is not uncommon to see snow and temperatures plummeting to well below zero. November to March is the rainy season, most notably on the Ionian Islands. If you are planning a beach holiday, the sea is warm enough to swim from June through September, and hardier types will also manage in May and October. Seaside hotels are generally open from Easter through to late-October, as are water sports facilities. Spring (March to May) and autumn (September to November) are the ideal seasons for hiking and mountain biking, when the days are sunny but not unreasonably hot. Spring sees the Greek countryside dappled with wild flowers, while in autumn the trees take on russet hues. Although few people think of Greece as a winter destination, it is in fact possible to ski and snowboard here. Two of the most popular mountain ski resorts are Arahova (near Delphi) and Kalavrita (on the Peloponnese). Lightweight clothes (cotton is best) during summer months, including protection from the midday sun and sunglasses. Light sweaters are needed for evenings, especially on the islands. Waterproofs are advised for spring and autumn. Winter months can be quite cold, especially in the northern mainland, so normal winter wear will be required. Greece is situated in southeast Europe, bordering Albania, Macedonia and Bulgaria to the north, Turkey to the east and the Mediterranean Sea to the south and west. The mainland consists of the following regions: Central Greece, Peloponnese, Thessaly, Epirus, Macedonia (which, incidentally, borders the country Republic of Macedonia, also known as the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia or FYR Macedonia) and Thrace. High mountains, fertile plains, pine forest and scrub-covered foothills are all found on the Greek mainland. The largest mountain range is the Pindus, which runs north-south through central mainland Greece, and separates the regions of Thessaly and Epirus. The highest mountain is Olympus, which soars 2,917m (9,570ft) - according to Ancient Greek mythology, this is where the 12 Olympian Gods resided. The islands account for one-fifth of the country's land area. The majority are thickly clustered in the Aegean between the Greek and Turkish coasts. The Ionian Islands are the exception; they are scattered along the west coast in the Ionian Sea, looking (both geographically and culturally) towards Italy. The Aegean archipelago includes the Dodecanese, lying off the Turkish coast, of which Rhodes is the best known; the northeast Aegean group, including Chios, Ikaria, Lemnos, Lesvos and Samos; the Sporades, off the central mainland; and the Cyclades, comprising 39 islands (of which only 24 are inhabited). Crete, the largest island (with an astounding 1,000km/621miles of coastline and a population of some 650,000), is not included in any formal grouping."
europe,channel-islands,"Lush botanical gardens, alluring hidden coves, and glorious sunsets over the Atlantic Ocean give the Channel Island of Guernsey an unlikely subtropical feel. Sitting just 50km (30 miles) from the shore of Normandy in France, this little isle also has a Gallic air with its French street names and culinary flair. Listen carefully and you may even hear the ancient local dialect of Dgèrnésiais (Norman patois) being spoken. Although small, only 62 sq km (38 sq miles) in size, Guernsey harbours a strong local identity. It's a self-governing British Crown dependency, and the locals are quick to point out that it is not part of the United Kingdom and European Union. Keen-eyed observers will spot a few differences, like blue post boxes and the use of numerical car plates. On May 9 Liberation Day, the islanders celebrate the end of the German occupation during World War II with the towns and houses across the island decked out in flags and bunting. British families have been drawn to Guernsey for generations – it certainly is the quintessential holiday destination, where kids can roam free while parents relax with a book on the beach. The pace of life is certainly more relaxed than Britain, so visitors can take their time, wander the coastline, enjoy a round of golf and stroll the streets of the island's pretty capital, St Peter Port. Vazon Bay on the north western coast of Guernsey is the largest beach among the island's 27 beaches. Meanwhile, the southern coast's rocky coastline is perfect for nature-loving kayakers who can gaze back at the towering cliffs, or even get up onto the rocks for coasteering and abseiling. Alternatively, head to Cobo Bay and Vazon Bay to join scores of kitesurfers and windsurfers testing their mettle out to sea. Landmarks to look out for on Guernsey include the Little Chapel and Castle Cornet, while a little patch of France comes in the form of Victor Hugo’s house. With daily ferries to the nearby islands of Herm, Sark and Jersey are popular, Guernsey also makes a great base from which to explore the other Channel Islands. 62 sq km (38 sq miles). 66,500 (2017). 965 per sq km.

Peter Ferbrache is the President of Guernsey states since 2020.","Guernsey has some 1500 years of recorded history having been settled by Britons migrating to Brittany in the 5th century. Part of the medieval Duchy of Normandy, it became inextricably linked to Britain when William the Conqueror gained the crown in 1066. Later in 1204, when King John lost Normandy to France, Guernsey, along with other Channel Islands, remained loyal to the English monarchy. Although occupied by Capetian French and by Aragonese mercenaries during the Hundred Years War, it remained in British hands until the German invasion during WWII. Many of the island's children were evacuated to mainland England, thus avoiding the harsh conditions under which those that remained had to live. The best-selling novel, The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society, which peels back the curtain on life in Nazi-occupied Guernsey, remains in print. A film adaptation is now a blockbuster. Liberated in 1945, the Bailiwick of Guernsey, which includes the islands of Alderney and Sark, both of which have their own parliament, and the smaller islands of Herm, Jethou and Lihou, enjoys a large degree of self-government, with its own legal and political institutions. Guernsey is a British Crown dependency but it is not part of the United Kingdom. It is also not part of the European Union. Did you know? •	French author Victor Hugo lived on Guernsey for 15 years and the French Consulate is based at his former home, Hauteville House. •	Guernsey’s post boxes (since 1969) and telephone kiosks (since 2002) are painted blue, but are otherwise identical to their red counterparts in the UK. •	Many houses in the west of Guernsey have a piece of granite protruding from their walls. Known as ""witches' seats"", they are meant for witches to have a rest while flying around on broomsticks. Church of England, Presbyterian, Baptist, Congregational and Methodist. Handshaking is the customary form of greeting and normal social courtesies should be observed when visiting someone's home. It is not usual to start eating until everyone is served. If invited to someone's home, a small present such as flowers or chocolates is appreciated. Casual wear is acceptable in most places. Smoking is banned in enclosed public places. English is the official language, while French is still used for administrative purposes, and spoken by many islanders. Dgèrnésiais is the local language unique to Guernsey; it is a sort of Norman patois. Although usage is comparatively low, it is still spoken in some parishes, and there are some initiatives aimed at increasing the number of speakers.","Guernsey enjoys a temperate oceanic climate categorised by long, dry summers and mild winters. Spring (March to May) starts off cool but by May, temperatures reach an average of high of 14°C (57°F) and an average low of 9°C (48°F), a good time for hikers to savour the uncrowded landscapes. Summer (June to August) is peak season and rainfall at its lowest. 19°C (66°F) is the average high in July and August, and with the sea temperatures ranging from 16°C (61°F) to 19°C (66°F) in August, this is the perfect time to go for a swim in the ocean. Autumn (September to November) is the best time to visit for budget-conscious travellers as prices are lower and the weather is still warm. Every October, the island hosts the Tennerfest where foodies feast on a three-course meal for £10 to £20 per person. Winter (December to February) is never that cold but can be grey and rainy. February is considered the coldest month with an average high of 7°C (45°F) and an average low of 4°C (39°F), still relatively warm considered by many. Normal beach and holiday wear for summer, with a jacket or a sweater for the evenings. Rainwear are advised from November to March. Guernsey is situated in the Gulf of St Malo, 50km (30 miles) from the coast of France and 130km (80 miles) from the south coast of England. The cliffs on the south coast rise to 80m (270ft), from which the land slopes away gradually to the north. Guernsey is an ideal centre for excursions to the other Channel Islands and France. The islands of Alderney, Brecqhou, Herm, Jethou, Lihou and Sark are dependencies of Guernsey."
europe,hungary,"Culturally and linguistically distinct from all of its immediate neighbours, Hungary is very much the ‘odd one out’ in Central Europe, but for all the most honourable reasons. This is a nation whose capital, Budapest, can hold up a mirror to classical Vienna; it’s a world of well-preserved castles, seductively good wines and quiet stoic pride; a landscape of low-lying mountains, oak forests and thermal springs. The Romans were the first to make use of the hot waters, originally for medicinal purposes. Today, the pursuit is relaxation and over time the bathhouses have grown into splendid architectural affairs, most notably in Budapest. The capital is an elegant, stylish and lively city made up of two separate settlements clustered on either side of the Danube River: hilly Buda has a wealth of graceful Habsburg and neoclassical buildings, while sprawling Pest is its commercial centre with a generous scattering of art nouveau architecture and an ad-hoc party scene. The city has long been the focus of Hungary’s artistic, musical and literary community and is by far the best place in the country for a choice of bars, restaurants and nightclubs. Smaller cities are equally architecturally fascinating and deserving of a visit in their own right: Pécs for its museums; Eger for it’s fortifications and infamous Bull’s Blood Wine; and Györ whose grand Basilica houses the golden herm of László. Beyond these urban centres, Hungary’s bathes in natural delights. South west of Budapest is Lake Balaton, Central Europe’s largest body of freshwater, where locals spend hot summers cooling off in waters that average 20°C (68°F). In winter, Hungary freezes, and thrill seekers head north to the Bakony Hills for the chance to ski through the forests before unwinding with a dip in the thermal spa. It may be landlocked, but Hungary is a country content on ploughing its own furrow no matter what seeds its neighbours are sewing and is all the better for it. 93,028 sq km (35,918 sq miles). 9,821,318 (UN estimate 2016). 106.4 per sq km. Budapest. Parliamentary Republic. President Tamás Sulyok since 2024. Prime Minister Viktor Orbán since 2010.","Hungary was first colonised by nomadic Magyars from southern Russia in the ninth century, but had previously been occupied by Celts, Romans, Slavs and Avars. The Magyars created a unified kingdom under their ruler Árpád that would last almost a thousand years until a brutal Mongol invasion devastated the kingdom at the end of the 13th century. The Kingdom of Hungary slowly re-established itself as a leading European power and when the Mongols abandoned Europe a new threat came in the shape of Ottoman Turks who were defeated at the end of the 15th century by Matthias Corvinus, a powerful military leader and a patron of the arts. His successor was less successful, and Hungary fell under Ottoman rule during the 16th century and was not able to re-establish its independence until 1718, forming an alliance with Austria as part of the Habsburg Empire ruled by a Magyar aristocracy. Despite several uprisings in the mid-19th century, the country remained essentially a feudal state until the end of World War 1 when, in 1918, it finally dissolved its union with Austria. Hungary sided with Nazi Germany during World War 2 until 1944 when German troops occupied the country. Following the Russian invasion in January 1945, Hungary became a short-lived republic before joining the Warsaw Pact as a Soviet-style socialist state in 1949. Declining living conditions and widespread political purges eventually led to the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 under Prime Minister Imre Nagy, in which Hungary attempted withdrawal from the Warsaw Pact. The uprising was soon quashed with the support of Soviet army units, leaving an estimated 20,000 dead and nearly a quarter of a million Hungarians exiled. Despite this brutal suppression of freedom, Hungary was considered one of the most liberal countries in the Eastern Bloc particularly after 1968 and the introduction of the New Economic Mechanism, allowing a significant role to be taken by private enterprise. During the 1980s the political situation relaxed still further, and with the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1989 Hungary was free to begin the transition to a pluralistic political system. The first free elections were held in the spring of 1990. Hungary joined NATO in 1999 and became a full European Union member in 2004. The political landscape is dominated by the conservative Hungarian Civic Union, Fidesz, which holds a near supermajority in the National Assembly. Did you know? • Hungary has a rich heritage of folk dance that date back at least as far as the Middle Ages. • The Romans brought the spa to Hungary, a land of thermal water. • Unicum, a liquor made from a blend of 40 herbs, is traditionally drunk before or after a meal.  Christianity: 52% Roman Catholic, 16% Calvinist, 3% Lutheran, 2.6% Greek Catholic and a small number of other Christian, Eastern Orthodox and Jewish minorities. When meeting a Hungarian, handshaking is customary and both first name and surname should be used. At a meal, toasts are usually made and should be returned. Gifts such as flowers, chocolates, or a bottle of good quality wine are acceptable for hosts as a token of thanks – particularly when invited for a meal. Smoking, although popular in Hungary, is prohibited on public transport in towns and public buildings. English is quite widely spoken in tourist areas, but some knowledge of German can also prove useful. Hungarian (Magyar) is the official language. German and English are widely spoken by both the older and younger generations. Some French is also spoken, mainly in western Hungary.","Hungary has a mild continental climate. There are four distinct seasons, with a very warm summer from June to August where temperatures can rise to as high as 35°C (95°F). Spring and autumn are mild, while winters are very cold, as low as -10°C (14°F), and not a good time to visit rural areas – although city breaks are enjoyable at any time of year. The south of the country around Pécs is a little warmer on average, although the region still experiences snowfall in winter. Annual rainfall is an average of 6cm (2.3 inches) and is relatively evenly distributed throughout the year, with snowfall common in winter. Lightweights for summer, medium weight clothing for spring and heavier clothing for autumn and winter. Waterproofs can prove useful at any time of year. Long-sleeved shirts, trousers, boots and hats should be worn to protect exposed skin in forested, grassy and lakeside areas in summer to prevent bites from ticks. Hungary is situated in Central Europe, sharing borders to the north with Slovakia, to the northeast with Ukraine, to the east with Romania, to the south with Croatia and Serbia, and to the west with Austria and Slovenia. Despite much of the country lying lower than 200m (656ft), there are several ranges of hills, chiefly in the north and west. The country’s highest point is Kékes in the Matra Mountains northeast of Budapest, which is 1,014m (3,327ft) high. Other, relatively low, mountain ranges include the North Hungarian Mountains, the Transdanubian Mountains and Mecsek north of Pécs. The lowest point, near Szeged in southern Hungary, is just 77m (253ft) above sea level. The Great Hungarian Plain, which stretches northeast from the Danube to the foothills of the Carpathian Mountains, east to the mountains of Transylvania in Romania, and south to the Fruška Gora range in Serbia, covers more than half of Hungary’s total territory. It is flat and low-lying throughout, never exceeding more than 183m (591ft) in height. The Little Hungarian Plain is similar, but much smaller, and lies in northwest Hungary next to the Austrian and Slovakian borders. Two major European rivers run through Hungary, the Danube and the Tisza. The former flows through Budapest on its way to the Black Sea via Croatia, Serbia, Bulgaria and Romania. The River Tisza, which has its source in Ukraine, flows south through Hungary into Vojvodina in northern Serbia, where it joins with the Danube. Both rivers are navigable in Hungary. Smaller rivers include the Rába, Szamos, Sío and the Drava, which largely defines the Croatian border. Hungary has no coastline, but the country is home to Lake Balaton in west-central Hungary, which is sometimes referred to as the ‘Hungarian Sea’. Lake Balaton is a regionally important freshwater lake, the largest in Central Europe, with a surface area of 592 sq km (229 sq miles). At 78km (48 miles) long and up to 14km (9 miles) wide, it’s Hungary’s largest recreational area and a popular destination for both summer swimming and winter sports. Hungary also has two much smaller lakes: Lake Velence, which is a bird reserve, and Lake Fertö, which straddles the Austrian border near Sopron."
europe,spain,"Although Ibiza has long been synonymous with fun in the sun hedonism, a trip to the island is not all about sultry clubs and all-night raves – away from the bright lights there’s a quieter side to the so-called ‘White Isle’. But first to the merrymaking, because make no mistake this Spanish haven is one of the foremost party destinations in Europe. During the summer, superstar DJs arrive en masse to entertain the millions of partyers who come for the quintessential boho-glam vibes of this sun-kissed island. Ibiza Town is a hotbed of late-night revelry. The municipality is home to the world-famous clubs Pacha and Amnesia, which share quaint cobblestone streets with more traditional attractions such as Santa Maria d’Eivissa Cathedral. Sant Antoni de Portmany (San Antonio) is the real clubbing capital, though. The so-called ‘Sunset Strip’ is renowned for its rowdy clubs and spectacular skies. Millions flock to witness resident DJs ‘put the sun to bed’ as they sip expensive cocktails and bliss out to party-perfect tunes. For sophisticates, there are a host of alternatives nearby, with chic bars offering expensive mélanges of spirits and exquisite sunset views. Its reputation as a party island is notorious, but Ibiza has reconnected with its 1960’s hippy roots in recent years, with more laid-back parties and a burgeoning arts scene. Those seeking quiet time or craving a bit of culture are also well catered for: Ibiza is blessed with sandy beaches, crystalline waters and alluring coves, not to mention an abundance of picturesque towns and villages. Families are also well catered for in relaxing resorts such as Santa Eulària des Riu (Santa Eulalia del Río) and Es Canar (Es Caná) on the northeast coast. Whether you’re there to dance till dawn, relax on a beach, imbibe the culture or hike amidst the greenery, Ibiza is a rite of passage for every discerning traveller. 571 sq km (220 sq miles). 156,234 (2019). 259 per sq km.

Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez since 2018.","Ibiza has been attracting a cosmopolitan crowd for centuries – Romans, Greeks, Moors, Phoenicians and Catalans all visited the White Isle, some arriving to trade and relax in the clear warm Mediterranean waters, others with conquest in mind. Due to its strategic position between mainland Spain and Africa, Ibiza was highly prized as a colony and trading post and was visited by the Ancient Greeks and later ruled by both the Carthaginians and the Romans. The island fell briefly into the hands of the Vandals, and later the Byzantines, before being ruled for many centuries by the Moors – who were in turn conquered by the Catalans in 1235. King James I conquered the island in 1235 and ordered the deportation of the local Muslim population and Christian colonists brought in from Girona. The island maintained its own self-government in several forms until 1715 when King Philip V of Spain abolished the local government’s autonomy. During the early 20th century members of the avant-garde and, in particular, the Surrealist movement were drawn to Ibiza where they established alternative lifestyle communities based on intellectualism and creativity that were to later lay the foundations for the influx of hippies and beatniks during the 1950s and 60s. All of these influences are still visible and celebrated today, as seen in Ibiza Old Town, which exudes a thriving artistic heritage as well as a number of weekly craft markets held across the island. The arrival of democracy in the late 1970s led to the Statute of Autonomy of the Balearic Islands, and today the island is part of the Balearic Autonomous Community, along with Mallorca, Menorca and Formentera. In recent years Ibiza has been associated with its famous club scene (infamous if all tabloid newspaper stories are to be believed) and the modern invasion of international party people that ritually descend on the island during the summer months, although the government is keen to attract more salubrious tourists and has passed local laws requiring all nightclubs to close by 0600 at the latest. Did you know? • In 1969 the feature film More was filmed on the island and features a soundtrack by Pink Floyd including a track called Ibiza Bar • Large areas of the island as registered as UNESCO World Heritage Sites, including the famous God’s Finger in Benirràs Bay • Ibiza is one of many places thought to have been the birthplace of Christopher Columbus, and a monument in his honour can be found in Sant Antoni There is no official religion, but the majority of the population is Roman Catholic. Spanish life has undergone rapid change in recent decades, and many of the stricter religious customs are giving way to modernity, particularly in the cities and among women. In spite of this, traditions remain strong; hospitality, chivalry and courtesy thrive. Handshaking is the customary form of greeting between men, while women to whom one has already been introduced may be greeted with a fleeting kiss to either cheek. Normal social courtesies should be observed when visiting someone's home, and a small gift is always appreciated. The evening meal is taken late, generally 2100-2200. Smoking in public places including is banned but many of the bars and clubs are a bit lax about this, and most have terraces where you can smoke too. However, enforcement of the ban is getting stricter all the time. While Castilian Spanish is the principal language of most of Spain, on Ibiza the official language is Catalan which has its own local dialect known as Ibicenco. Road signs are generally in Catalan, though maps are generally in Spanish with occasional Catalonian translations, so visitors should be prepared for places to have two slightly different names.","With a Mediterranean climate, Ibiza enjoys mild winters and hot summers that can see temperatures exceeding 30ºC (86ºF) and an average of over 11 hours of sunshine per day. Rain tends to fall in the cooler winter months between October and December though occasional showers are not unusual at any time of year. The high season runs from June to September, when temperatures are at their highest, and this is the best time to visit for the infamous Ibiza nightlife or beach holidays. To avoid the crowds, visit in May or October when the weather is still sunny, rain is rare, but the party season has either yet to begin or is coming to a close. In winter, the temperature rarely drops under 0ºC (32ºF). From November to April, the average daytime temperature is about 15ºC (59ºF). However, when the sun comes out, this can rapidly climb to 25ºC (77ºF). Light to medium weights and waterproofs if visiting in the wettest season between October and December, with warmer clothing occasionally necessary for cooler evenings. July and August are particularly hot so pack beachwear for the day and loose-fitting clothes for the evening. Ibiza is 571 sq km (220 sq miles), making it the third-largest of the Balearic Islands, an archipelago off the coast of Spain that includes Mallorca, Menorca, Ibiza (Eivissa) and Formentera. It is located in the Mediterranean Sea, 75km (46.6 miles) to the East of the Iberian Peninsula, 82km (51 miles) southwest of Mallorca and 87km (54 miles) away from the Alicante coast. Despite only measuring approximately 35km (21 miles) in length at its longest point, and just 20km (12 miles) in width, Ibiza boasts two mountain ranges, both covered in thick, hardy woodland which inspired early Greek invaders to name Ibiza and neighbouring Formentera the Islas Pitiusas (Islands of Pine Trees). The Pitiusas are surrounded by over 60 small islets, such as S'Espardell, S'Espalmador and Penjats between Ibiza and Formentera, Es Vedrá, Es Vedranell, S'Espartar, Bosc, Bledes and Conillera in the southwest and Tagomago in the northeast. The highest point of Ibiza is Atalaya of Sa Talaiassa de Sant Josep, at 475m (1,561ft), while the land to the south is the lowest point and consists of salt pans that have been exploited since ancient times and continue to be both an industry and tourist attraction. The most common crops grown are olives, figs and almonds. The long, often rugged coastline is peppered with a mixture of fine sandy beaches, pebbles, rocks and cliffs."
europe,iceland,"A country of extreme geological contrasts, Iceland has built up an impressive tourism sector with over 2 million visitors a year flocking to see its moss-covered lava fields, glacier-fed ice caves, rock-ribbed coast and ash-spouting volcanos. Widely known as ""the land of fire and ice"", Iceland is crammed with magnificent scenery that delights and awes at every turn. The word fire in the phrase refers to Iceland's abundant volcanoes, which burst into life periodically. Elemental forces bubble just below the surface across the country, and clever Icelanders have long been accessing geothermal energy to generate electricity, heat tap water and warm up tomato greenhouses. Volcanic tourism is also lucrative, with tourists taking trips to see bubbling fumaroles and soak in thermal springs. The two famous examples of the latter are the Blue Lagoon and Sky Lagoon near Reykjavík; both are geothermal spas that aim to soothe your aches and pains. Ice is Iceland's other big draw (the clue is in the name) – more specifically, the dramatic glaciers that slice down towards the coast, calving icebergs into serene lagoons. About 11% of the country is covered in glaciers, with Vatnajökull being the largest and extending some 8,400km² (3,243mi²) in the southeast with thick layers of snow blanketing many high, majestic mountain ridges. Iceland's highest peak, Hvannadalshnjúkur (2,119m or 6,592ft) can also be found here. Guided tours to glaciers, ice caves and frozen waterfalls are widely available. Reykjavík, Iceland's capital city, is where most travellers start their journey. This fun and vibrant city, with its many museums, marine excursions, and colourful nightlife, is certainly a worthy diversion. So come to experience walking in a lava cave, climb a glacier, spot a whale, or catch the colourful northern lights in their full glory, undimmed by light pollution in the least densely populated nation in Europe. No matter what you do, a holiday in Iceland is an experience you'll remember for a lifetime. 103,000km² (39,769mi²). 341,243 (2020). 3 per sq km. Reykjavík. Republic.

In 1262, Iceland submitted to the King of Norway and Jónsbók (the code of laws) was introduced to the islanders in 1281. In 1397, the forming of the Kalmar Union saw Denmark, Sweden and Norway, along with Norway's colonies such as Iceland and Greenland, all came under the control of Denmark. In 1814, Norway became independent, but Iceland remained a Danish territory. In 1944, Iceland gained its independence and the new republic has been celebrating its National Day on 17 June ever since. Did you know? • Iceland banned all alcoholic drinks in 1915. Then over the decades, it slowly allowed red wine and spirits, but beer remained illegal until 1 March 1989 – the day is now celebrated as Bjordagur (Beer Day). • Many Icelanders believe in the existence of huldufólk (hidden people or elves), who have been part of the Icelandic folklore for centuries. • Icelanders do not use family names but adopt the first name of their father or mother as a last name, adding the suffix son (meaning son) or dóttir (meaning daughter). About 80% of Icelanders are Lutherans and another 5% belong to other Christian denominations. About 5% of the people still practise ásatrú, the traditional Norse religion. Iceland has a 99% literacy rate – its people are knowledgeable, well-spoken and very polite. Icelandic is the national language but Danish and English are widely spoken. Icelanders enjoy having a warm soak in a sundlaug (heated pool) or a geothermal spa, with many visiting a pool daily. In every public pool, the following bathing etiquette must be observed: • Remove your shoes before entering the locker room. Upon entering, use the wristband you've obtained at the reception to get a locker. Put away your phone because no camera is allowed (unless you are visiting a tourist-oriented geothermal spa like the Sky Lagoon). • Undress and put away your clothes, but take your swimsuit and towel to the shower room and leave them in one of the shelving units there. • Wash thoroughly without your swimsuit. If you are uncomfortable, use one of the private cubicles. • Put on your swimsuit and go to the pool. After that, relax in the hot tub. • Once you're done, proceed to the shower area and wash again. You must then dry off (with the towel you've left in the shower room earlier) before entering the locker room. • Put on your clothes and visit the hair-drying area if you wish. • Leave the locker room and put on your shoes outside. • Drop your wristband into a box, which will open the turnstile so you can leave.

Spring (April to May) starts late but temperatures soon climb above the freezing point. In Reykjavík, the average temperature reaches 6°C (43°F) by May. Summer (June to August) is lovely, with long days and mild temperatures. This is the best time to visit Iceland. In Reykjavík, the sky may be cloudy, but with temperatures hovering around 11°C (52°F) and plenty of events taking place, it is hard not to feel happy. Autumn (September to October) starts off relatively warm but temperatures soon drop to an average of 4°C (39°F) by October. Winter (November to March) is long, cold and dark. In Reykjavík, rainfall is frequent but you can also expect a small amount of snow between December and January, with temperatures averaging 0°C (32°F). If you travel north, naturally you can expect a colder climate. Snow is also abundant in the plateaus and mountains. Beware that you only get a few hours of daylight each day, especially in December. As the weather in Iceland can be unpredictable, use layers to keep yourself cool or warm, regardless of which month you go to Iceland. In the winter, add gloves and thermals to your packing list. Waterproof garments are also essential. Another must-bring item is swimwear – even in the winter, Icelanders visit heated pools or geothermal spas to relax. Located near the Arctic Circle, Iceland covers some 103,000km² (39,769mi²) and is the second-largest island in Europe, after Great Britain. Iceland sits on top of two tectonic plates – where the Eurasian and American tectonic plates meet. As the plates split apart gradually, new landmass is being formed and as a result, Iceland grows by about 5cm (2in) a year. The most significant of these seismic features can be seen at Þingvellir (Thingvellir) National Park, particularly along the Almannagjá gorge, which is essentially the space between the tectonic plates. About 11% of the country is covered in glaciers and another 70% is uninhabited. In other words, the landscape of Iceland is wild, untamed but extremely beautiful, dotted with majestic waterfalls, snow-capped volcanoes, moss-covered lava fields and black sand beaches. The moon-like landscape also makes Iceland the ideal training ground for American astronauts. In fact, the Apollo 11 crew were trained in the areas around Húsavík, a small fishing village on Iceland's northern coast."
europe,ireland,"Ireland is one of the globe’s most singular travel destinations, a feisty, twinkling country far more famous for the sum of its parts than for any specific sight or attraction. Its landscapes are raw, its cities are animated and its history holds endless tales of adversity. Tying all this together is the Irish character, a fabled combination of bright-eyed bonhomie and bar-room banter: there’s good reason why the planet’s full of Irish pubs. Lovable Dublin falls naturally as the most popular option for first-time visitors, although for all the capital city’s stately architecture and riverside charm, it only partly hints at what the wider country has to offer. The real spirit of today’s nation might be up for debate – it’s as likely to be found in a Connemara village as a Cork street scene – but searching for it is hugely enjoyable. It’s often said that there are two Irelands. Despite its economic woes, 21st-century Ireland is a modern destination, full of fresh creativity. At the same time, of course, it’s somewhere rooted in the strongest of traditions, a country marked by humour, hospitality and more than the occasional late night. The craic of legend isn’t generally hard to find. With all this in mind, it’s perhaps no surprise that Ireland caters for such a broad range of interests. Those in search of windswept hikes, Celtic relics and fiddle-and-song pubs will be well sated, but so too will those looking for on-trend gastronomy, family-friendly attractions or slick hotels. The country may be small but its cultural impact worldwide continues to be enormous, and this is due to far more than just a romantic notion of how it used to be. Various icons and images enjoy close associations with Ireland (see everything from craggy peninsulas to pints of Guinness) but the real beauty of the country is the fact that it transcends every cliché that people throw at it. Its potential for adventure – for real, blood-pumping adventure – is all too often overlooked, while for those who just want to take it easy, the options are copious. 70,182 sq km (27,097 sq miles). 4,713,993 (UN estimate 2016). 69.7 per sq km.

It was a war between Irish chieftains and the Vikings which first led to English involvement. In 1169-70, Richard of Clare, Earl of Pembroke (nicknamed Strongbow), was invited over by an Irish chieftain to help protect his interests. Instead, Strongbow conquered almost the entire country with only a tiny force of archers and mounted knights. Many Norman families subsequently moved across the Irish Sea, effectively colonising the country. Thus followed the notorious ‘800 years’ of English rule. Repeated and largely unsuccessful efforts from the 14th century onwards were made to bring the island under Irish control. The country’s turbulent political life then took a new twist after the English Civil War, when the Irish rose in favour of the deposed monarchy in 1649. The victorious Oliver Cromwell led an army across the Irish Sea and ruthlessly quashed the rebellion. The Act of Union in 1801 incorporated England, Scotland, Wales, and the whole of Ireland into the United Kingdom. However, the grossly inadequate response of the government to the potato famine of 1845 and 1846 highlighted its lack of interest in the welfare of the Irish people, and, after prolonged uprisings, Irish Home Rule was granted in 1920. The terms of independence stipulated that Ireland be partitioned into two parts. In the northern provinces, where most Protestants had settled three centuries earlier, there was fierce opposition to the prospect of being ruled by a Catholic majority. Six of the nine counties of the historic province of Ulster therefore remained in the United Kingdom, and the other 26 counties became the Irish Free State. The ensuing civil war in the south between supporters and opponents of the agreement gave rise to the country's two main political parties, Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael. In 1937, the Irish Free State was given full sovereignty within the Commonwealth. In 1949, the 26 counties became a republic. Since the 1970s, Ireland has been governed alternately by Fianna Fáil and a coalition of Fine Gael and the smaller Labour Party. Recent political agenda has been dominated by the challenge to the orthodox morality of the Catholic Church, especially on the contentious issues of abortion and divorce. A milestone was marked in 2015 when Ireland became the first country in the world to legalise gay marriage by popular vote. Did you know? •	The Aran Islands still host an annual Father Ted festival. •	The longest place name in the country is claimed by County Galway’s Muckanaghederdauhaulia. •	Arthur Guinness signed a 9,000-year lease for the St James’ Gate brewery in 1759. Roman Catholic 84%, the remainder being Protestant, with Jewish and Islamic minorities. The Irish are renowned as an affable, easy-going people, whose conversation is liberally dosed with humour, irreverence and - if you listen carefully - a beal bocht, an Irish expression that translates as 'the poor mouth'. It refers to a kind of modesty where the speaker is careful to talk themselves down and never reveal how well he or she is actually doing. In short, the Irish don't really like a show-off. Arguably the best place to observe and engage with the Irish is in the pub, still a centre of social interaction in Ireland, especially in smaller communities throughout the country. A meal in an Irish home is usually a substantial affair and guests will eat well. Dinner is the main meal of the day and is now eaten in the evening. Casual dress is widely acceptable, but people will often dress up for smart restaurants and social functions. Handshaking is usual, and modes of address will often be informal. Smoking is banned in all public enclosed/working spaces, including pubs, bars and restaurants. Irish (Gaelic) is the official language. Estimates vary on the number of people who genuinely speak it as a first language (somewhere between 50,000 and 100,000), but English is the language of the majority.

Summers are warm – only rarely getting unpleasantly hot – while temperatures during winter are much cooler, although it’s far from common for the temperature to drop below freezing and snowfall is rare. Spring and autumn are very mild, with rainfall expected all year round. The other chief characteristic of the climate, however, is its unpredictability. You might be basking in balmy T-shirt weather one week, then wrapping up to stave off the chill the next – all the while with an umbrella to hand. Lightweights during summer with warmer mediumweights for the winter. Rainwear is advisable throughout the year. If you find yourself lacking anything essential on arrival, of course, all key centres are well stocked with clothing outlets, with the larger cities particularly good in terms of picking up high quality outdoor equipment. And it's worth remembering that certain clothing items which are more commonly seen as souvenirs – hand-knit Aran sweaters, for example – can be practical purchases for the trip itself. The Republic of Ireland lies in the north Atlantic Ocean and is separated from Britain by the Irish Sea to the west. The northeastern part of the island (Northern Ireland) is part of the United Kingdom. There are four provinces: Leinster, which covers the eastern portion of the country around Dublin; Munster, which covers the south; Connacht, which covers the west of Ireland; and Ulster, which is predominantly in Northern Ireland but also covers the northern tip of the Republic. Ireland has a central plain surrounded by a rim of mountains and hills offering some of the most varied and unspoilt scenery in Europe. Inland you’ll find bogs, moors, forests, lakes, mountains and wetlands. Quiet sandy beaches, semi-tropical bays warmed by the Gulf Stream, and rugged cliffs make up the 5,600km (3,500 miles) of coastline. For those who really want to make the most of the coastal scenery (and are keen to see a bit of Northern Ireland too), a full loop of the island – sticking close to the sea at all times – can be done with ease in a couple of weeks.   Together, the landscape and the offshore waters provide a good habitat for a wide variety of wildlife. Seals and dolphins are spotted regularly, while the Cork coast even offers the chance to whale-watch over the summer months. There are numerous rivers in Ireland, the longest of which – the River Shannon, at 360 km (224 miles) in length – is also seen as one of the country’s most picturesque. Other notable waterways include the River Liffey, which flows from the Wicklow Mountains to the Irish Sea, through the centre of Dublin."
europe,united-kingdom,"As quirky destinations go, you’d be hard-pressed to beat the Isle of Man. Its mere existence is even a bit odd. Though officially part of the British Isles, the island is a self-governing kingdom that belongs to neither the United Kingdom nor European Union. Confused? You should be. Things get stranger still, when you arrive on the island and find you’ve travelled back in time – this is a place where it is possible to get a steam train to the airport. Suffice to say the island’s antiquity adds to the charm of this destination, which is also home to some spectacular scenery: lush valleys, rugged shores and fine sandy beaches abound, making it an adventure playground for outdoor enthusiasts. Measuring 53km (33 miles) long and 21km (13 miles) wide, the Isle of Man floats in the middle of the Irish Sea, just off the Lancashire coastline. Killer whales, humpbacks, basking sharks, dolphins, seals and myriad bird species can be spotted in the surrounding waters, which are ripe for scuba diving. The island’s main draw, however, is the notoriously dangerous TT motorcycle race, which takes place annually. Too fast for you? Then hit one of the many hiking and mountain biking trails, which crisscross the island. Or delve into the island’s curious history by exploring the prehistoric tombs, elaborate Celtic crosses and Iron Age hilltop forts, which are scattered across the wild landscape. Beneath the time-warp surface, present-day Isle of Man has a contemporary edge. It’s still heavily associated with the finance industry, yet film-making and tourism are increasingly important as people start to discover the island's quiet natural beauty and rich heritage. All things considered, the Isle of Man is a curious destination and perhaps the best-kept secret in the British Isles. 572 sq km (221 sq miles). 87,545 (2015). 153.1 per sq km. Douglas. Self-governed dependency of the British Crown. HM King Charles III since 2022, represented locally by Lieutenant Governor Sir John Lorimer since 2021. Chief Minister Alfred Cannan since 2021.","A British Crown dependency in the Irish Sea, the Isle of Man is self-governing but with HM The Queen as Head of State represented locally by a Lieutenant Governor. The original inhabitants of the Isle of Man were Neolithic and Mesolithic tribes, followed by Bronze Age dwellers and the Celts (whose civilisation is the basis of Manx culture). Christianity was introduced during the 5th and 6th centuries as the local language, Manx, began to emerge. The Vikings arrived more than 1,000 years ago and Norse rule prevailed in the establishment of the Kingdom of Mann and the Isles, which also included the Hebrides and the islands of the Firth of Clyde, from 979 to 1266. The Vikings founded the Tynwald parliament, which celebrated its millennium in 1979. Although there is no firm evidence for its having been founded in 979 it is one of the world’s oldest parliaments and annual outdoor sittings date back to the 8th century. After a brief period during which the Kingdom of Mann passed between English and Scottish rule, in 1333 Edward III renounced English claims and recognised it as an independent kingdom. In 1399 the island’s king, William, Earl of Wiltshire was executed for treason by Henry IV and his lands, including the Isle of Man, passed back to the English Crown. In 1405 the kingdom was given to Sir John Stanley whose descendants held it for 360 years before the 1765 Isle of Man Purchase Act, which returned the island to the British Crown. In recent years, the Isle of Man has become famous for its distinct tax status, capitalising on its independent standing to build up a thriving offshore banking and financial services sector. It’s also revered for the gruelling Isle of Man TT, a motorcycle race that has been taking place on the island since 1907.  Did you know? •	There is no national speed limit on Isle of Man roads, only local limits. •	The Isle of Man has become a centre for emerging private space travel companies and in 2012 was named the fifth most likely nation put the next man on the moon. •	The island’s distinctive ‘Three legs of Mann’ symbol, a triskelion, is of uncertain origin but may relate to Sicily. Predominantly Christian (Church of England, Roman Catholic, Presbyterian, Methodist), sizeable Muslim, Sikh, Jewish and Hindu minorities. Around 15% of the population have no religion. The monarchy, though now only symbolic politically, is a powerful and often subconscious unifying force. Members of the Royal Family are the subject of unceasing fascination, with their every move avidly followed and reported by the popular press, both in the UK and abroad. Handshaking is customary when introduced to someone for the first time. One kiss on the cheek is gaining popularity for close friends. Normal social courtesies should be observed when visiting someone's home and a small present such as flowers or chocolates is appreciated. It is polite to wait until everyone has been served before eating. Manx Gaelic, the indigenous language, is related to Scots and Irish Gaelic. At one time spoken by all the Manx, the tongue was replaced by English during the last century. In the 2001 census, 1,689 people claimed some knowledge of the language. On Tynwald Day, summaries of the new laws are read out in Manx and English. Manx Gaelic evening classes are regularly held, and a weekly radio programme and newspaper column appear in the language. In 2001, it was recognised by the European Charter of Regional or Minority Languages, as being a legitimate autochthonous regional language. Common phrases include moghrey mie (good morning) and fastyr mie (good afternoon).","The climate of the Isle of Man is temperate, with cool summers and mild winters. There is a considerable variation in rainfall over the island, although the average is high in comparison to the rest of the British isles, as the isle of Man is located to the west of mainland Britain and far enough from Ireland for moisture to accumulate on the prevailing south-westerly winds. The driest parts of the island are in the extreme south and over the northern plain, whilst the wettest are the hilly interior and Snaefell. However, frost and snow occur much less frequently than in other parts of the British Isles. Temperatures are consistently cool, although the recorded maximum is almost 29°C. The north of the island lies in a rain shadow and has higher levels of sunshine in general. With consistent temperatures, the Isle of Man is a good year-round destination. However, April, May and June are the driest months, whilst May, June and July are the sunniest and July and August are the warmest. You ought to take a range of clothing suitable for a variety of weather conditions. Ensure that you have waterproof and windproof layers as well as warmer clothing for the evenings. If you are going walking, make sure that you have comfortable, well-broken-in boots with good ankle support. The Isle of Man is an island situated in the Irish Sea, between the United Kingdom and Ireland; modest in size, it is just 53km (33 miles) long and 21km (13 miles) wide. The main towns are located along the coastline, which totals 161km (100 miles) and is dented with small bays. Legend has it that the Isle of Man was created when the Irish giant Finn MacCooill hurled a boulder from Ireland’s coastline towards Scotland during a fight. The boulder fell into the sea and became the island. The island’s terrain is varied; the larger part is formed from highly faulted and folded sedimentary rocks although there is an area of sandstone around Peel. Substantial deposits of copper, lead, silver, zinc and iron can be found on the island and there are also quarries of black marble, limestone, clay and granite. Over two-thirds of the land mass is cultivated. There are two main mountainous areas separated by a central valley that runs from Douglas to Peel. The northern end of the island is a flat plain made up of glacial tills and marine sediment, which leads gently to the sea and long sandy beaches that contrast with the rocky cliffs found elsewhere. At 621m (2,036ft), Snaefell is the only mountain and the highest point on the island. In the south, the island is generally hillier, with distinct valleys. Wooded glens can be found all over the island, often leading to the sea. The longest river on the island is the Sulby, which is 16.9km (10.5 miles) long. Smaller islands and outcrops can be found off the coast, including the Calf of Man at the southern tip and St Patrick’s Isle by Peel."
europe,italy,"Travelling around Italy remains one of those rare experiences in life – like a perfect spring day or the power of first love – that can never be overrated. In few places do history, art, fashion, food and la dolce vita (“the good life”) intermingle so effortlessly. In Italy you'll find sunny isles, glacial lakes and fiery volcanoes, rolling vineyards and urban landscapes harbouring more UNESCO World Heritage sites than any other country on Earth. Few places offer such variety and few visitors leave without a fervent desire to return. The artistic and architectural treasures of Rome, Venice, Florence and Naples draw visitors to them like moths to a flame. Not content with Romans conquering most of the known world, the Venetians dispatched Marco Polo to uncharted lands off the map, while Giotto, Leonardo da Vinci, Brunelleschi and Michelangelo kick-started the Renaissance in Western art and architecture. Look around at all the splendid palaces, paintings, churches and monuments and wonder at the centuries of hard graft and the unswerving devotion to traditional techniques. Like the local art, wine is also designed to elevate your spirits. From the neatly-banded stone terraces of the Cinque Terre, which snake from sea level to terrifying precipices, to the blousy hillsides of Chianti, the riverine plain of the Po valley and the volcanic slopes of Etna, Italian wines are lovingly made to complement the carefully-sourced regional cuisine on your plate. Much like its food, this country is an endless feast of experiences. No matter how much you gorge yourself, you’ll always feel as though you're still on the first course. Do you go skiing in the Dolomites, or cycling in wine country? Do you dive the sun-split waters of Sardinia, climb Aeolian volcanoes or stalk market stalls in Naples? The choice is dazzling and bewildering. So take the advice of the locals.

President Sergio Mattarella since 2015. Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni since 2022.","Five centuries before the Roman Republic conquered the Italian peninsula, the Etruscans and Greeks were tussling for control of Italian ports and fertile farming land. Despite the increasing power of the Greek states in Italy, the growing might of the Roman Empire overwhelmed them by the 2nd century BCE. By 100 CE, Rome was the most powerful city in the Mediterranean. While the capital prospered, poverty was rife in the provinces and by 400 CE the unwieldy Empire was divided in two, with a second capital established at Constantinople (modern-day Istanbul) in 330. When the Germans and the French Lombards overran Northern Italy, the Papacy established itself as a spiritual and secular force in Rome. While the south tended towards centralised rule, supporting the Papacy, powerful port cities such as Genoa, Pisa and Venice increasingly ignored edicts from Rome, while rich power centres like Milan, Florence, Bologna and Verona resisted Roman meddling in internal affairs, developing their own forms of government between the 12th and 14th centuries. These powerful city-states had both the wealth and independence to usher in a dynamic age of thinking known as the Renaissance. Despite the advances of this era, subsequent decades of war and plague were to fatally weaken the ruling dynasties. In 1797, Napoleon conquered Venice ending 700 years of independence and creating the first Kingdom of Italy in 1805. Inspired by the success of the French Revolution, Italians began to agitate for a fully independent, unified nation, and finally won national independence in 1861.  At the dawn of the 20th century, Italy was embroiled in a devastating, although ultimately successful, territorial skirmish with Austria in WWI. Around 600,000 men died and the country was reduced to poverty. Frustrated by the peace settlement at Versailles, Benito Mussolini and the Fascist Party rose to power on a tide of discontent. The following alliance with the German Nazis in 1940, which brought Italy into WWII, ultimately left the country shut out of any power positions in the latter half of the 20th century. Despite decades of political turbulence, Italy grew into one of the world’s leading economies in the 1980s. High unemployment, corruption and increasing national debt, however, culminated in crisis in 2008 and three years later Silvio Berlusconi was finally toppled from office. In February 2014, 39-year-old Matteo Renzi, the youngest Italian prime minister in history, was sworn in. He was replaced by Paolo Gentiloni in December 2016.

July is the hottest month with temperatures up to 30C (86F), and January is the coldest month. It is a great destination to visit year round, particularly if taking a city break, though for the warmest and most reliable weather April to June is the prime tourist season. Most Italians take their holiday in July and August so prices, and crowds, can soar during these months, which are also the hottest of the year. If you’re keen to avoid the main scrum of peak season but still bank on mild weather, late September to October is a good choice. Lightweight clothes are worn during the summer, except in the mountains. Winter demands light to mediumweights in the south, but warmer clothes elsewhere. Alpine wear is advised for winter mountain resorts. Italy is a boot-shaped country situated in southern Europe. Jutting out into the Mediterranean Sea, it shares borders with France, Switzerland, Austria and Slovenia in the mountainous north, which contains some of the highest peaks in Europe. In central Italy, Tuscany has a diverse landscape composed of fertile rolling hills, lush river valleys, minor mountain ranges and a long sandy coastline. To the east is Umbria, known as the ‘green heart of Italy' - hilly with broad plains, olive groves and pines, and Le Marche – a region of gentle mountains, rivers and small fertile plains. Further south lies Rome, Italy's capital city. Within its precincts lies Vatican City, the world's smallest country (by landmass). The south of the country is hotter, wilder and much drier than the north, characterised by dry sierras, rocky mountain ranges and volcanic outcrops, including three of Europe’s most active volcanoes: Vesuvius, Etna and Stromboli. Puglia, the ‘heel of the boot', is a mixed landscape of fertile plateaus, expansive olive groves and flat, ochre-coloured plains. The islands of Sicily and Sardinia lie offshore to the southwest and west respectively."
europe,channel-islands,"The largest of the Channel Islands, Jersey (officially the Bailiwick of Jersey) has the charms of a quaint and quiet island few people can resist. This laid-back haven promises an authentic sand-between-your-toes holiday. Beyond the beach, undulating farmlands stretch inland, dappled with wild meadows, vineyards and dreamy stargazing spots. Holidaymakers don't come to Jersey to check sites off a bucket list. They come to cycle the quiet country lanes, spend hours on beautiful beaches, linger over delicious meals, and find the best spot to watch the sunset. But not all visitors to Jersey stick to the more sedate pursuits. There are plenty of opportunities to surf the curls of turquoise waters (St Ouen's Bay is the perfect place to paddle out and enjoy the swells), take the kayak out to discover secluded bays, rock climb or coasteering if you wish. This unbeatable holiday destination is also easily accessible. Lying about 23km (14 miles) from the coast of Normandy in France and 137km (85 miles) south of the English coast, Jersey is linked to various European destinations by flights and ferries.

Annexed to the Duchy of Normandy during the 10th century when William of Normandy gained the English Crown in 1066, the Channel Islands became part of the Anglo-Norman realm. As a mark of his gratitude for its loyalty, in 1204 King John granted Jersey the foundations of self-government, which exists to this day. The connection between the island and the English throne is expressed in the flag, which contains a crest surmounted by the Plantagenet Crown. Like its neighbours, Jersey has been a haven for smugglers and pirates and, although its proximity to France has made it vulnerable to attack, the islanders fought off French invasions on numerous occasions, particularly during the 14th and 15th centuries. One of the most serious threats, led by Baron de Rullecourt, was repelled in 1781. Its darkest days though were during WWII when the Channel Islands became the only part of the Commonwealth to be occupied by German forces. Jersey has closely guarded its independence since WWII with strict criteria on rights of residency and an on-going reluctance to accept controls over its thriving financial services industry. A number of online retailers and fulfilment companies continue to operate from the Channel Islands, enjoying lower rates of tax than they would expect in the UK. Did you know? •	Jersey is one of the world's top offshore financial centres – with its reduced tax burdens many describe it as a tax haven. •	Based on ancient Norman, Jersey's once-dominant Jèrriais language is spoken by a few thousand islanders. • Jersey is not a part of the United Kingdom or the European Union, but it is a British Crown Dependency, meaning the UK government represents and defends it.

Jersey has about 18 bays accessible by foot, plus numerous coves which you could swim, sail or kayak to."
europe,kosovo,"Depending on your global perspective, Kosovo is either Europe’s youngest nation or not a nation at all. Since declaring independence from Serbia in 2008 it has received only partial recognition as a sovereign state by members of the United Nations. Its fragile footing and wretched modern history might make Kosovo an unlikely travel destination, but the country can be extremely rewarding for those keen to find out what lies beyond the headlines. Cultures and religions have been clashing in modern day Kosovo for centuries, but between the periods of unrest, this small, landlocked country has pioneered peaceful coexistence and mutual enrichment of cultures. While Muslim Albanians dominate the population today, followed by Orthodox Christian Serbs, there are many other groups with their own unique cultures and ways of life. Granted, roadside memorials and the occasional khaki-clad NATO soldier can make its cruel past somewhat hard to forget, but historic spots such as Janjevo and the UNESCO-listed Dečani Monastery showcase a distinguished Kosovan history that has been overshadowed by the recent catalogue of horrors. Europe’s youngest capital, Pristina, is an increasingly eclectic city with a vibrant café culture, but pretty Prizren is the city that has most visitors smitten. Cobbled streets, ancient walls, Ottoman mosques and Orthodox churches lend a romantic air to this riverside town, while the popular Dokufest Film Festival and Hasi Jehon folklore festival give credence to its status as a cultural capital. Much of the Kosovan countryside is uncharted territory for tourists, but dramatic mountain peaks, cascading waterfalls and limpid lakes are tailor made for adventure travellers. Combine all this with decidedly un-European prices and it’s not hard to see why visitor numbers are rising. Whether you’re sipping coffee in cosmopolitan cafés, hiking through the hinterland or visiting crumbling historic sites, in Kosovo, when you look beyond yesterday’s headlines, you’ll find an affable land of surprising beauty. 10,887 sq km (4,203 sq miles). 1,883,018 (CIA estimate 2016). 171.9 per sq km. Pristina. Republic. President Vjosa Osmani since 2021. Prime Minister Albin Kurti since March 2021.","During medieval times, Kosovo was the centre of the Serbian Empire. That is, until the 14th-century Battle of Kosovo, when the Ottomans defeated the Serbs and their allies, paving the path for the Turks to establish a rule over the region, which would last from the mid-15th century to the early 20th century. Prior to Turkish rule, the Kosovo population was predominantly Serb, but with the arrival of the Ottomans, Islam became more widespread and the number of Muslim ethnic Albanians rose. In 1912, Serbia regained control over Kosovo during the First Balkan War only to lose it again during WWI, when Kosovo became part of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (later renamed Yugoslavia). During WWII, Kosovo was united with Albania under Italian control and was later liberated and granted the status of an autonomous region within Yugoslavia. In 1989, Slobodan Milosevic set out his ultranationalist agenda in a speech at the rally on the Battle of Kosovo field, promising to restrict Kosovo autonomy. His policies led to three major wars and the eventual disintegration of Yugoslavia; the Kosovo conflict became the last act in the Balkan drama. Brutal actions of the Serbian army and paramilitaries led to the exodus of almost the entire Albanian population and prompted NATO bombardment of Serbian cities in 1999. When the Albanians returned, it was the time for Serbian civilians to flee persecution by the Kosovo Liberation Army fighters. Following years of unsuccessful talks in which neither party wanted to yield ground, Kosovo unilaterally proclaimed independence in February 2008, supported by major Western powers. It adopted a constitution, which gives broad autonomy to Serbian enclaves. However, Kosovo Serbs rejected this change and continue to see themselves as residents of the Serbian Autonomous Region of Kosovo and Metohija. In 2009, Kosovo held its first democratic elections since declaring independence from Serbia. Despite periods of unrest, high unemployment and problems with corruption, Kosovo has continued to make significant progress towards stability. In 2013 and 2015, Kosovo and Serbia signed landmark agreements in an effort to normalise relations between the two countries – a process both countries hope will advance their European Union accession agenda. Did you know? • Kosovo has the youngest population in Europe, with an estimated 70% of its citizens under 35. • Not only is Pristina’s main boulevard named after Bill Clinton, but the former American president is also honoured with a 3m-high (10ft) golden statue in the Kosovar capital. • Kosovo is rich in lignite coal and remains one of the most polluted regions in Europe. Sunni Islamic majority, Orthodox Christian and Roman Catholic minorities. Avoid taking pictures of military installations and looted houses of Serbs in the Albanian-populated parts, and of Albanians in the Serbian-populated parts; it may cause bad feeling.

In winter, mediumweight clothing and heavy overcoat; in summer, lightweight clothing and raincoat required. Landlocked Kosovo shares borders with Serbia, Macedonia, Montenegro and Albania. It is ringed by mountains: the Sharr (Å ar in Serbian) Mountains are located in the south and southeast, bordering Macedonia. The Kopaonik Mountains rise in the north. The southwest borders with Montenegro and Albania are also mountainous, and are home to the nation's highest mountain, Gjeravica (Äeravica in Serbian), 2,656m (8,714ft) high.

europe,spain,"Lanzarote is an island of extraordinary beauty and spectacular contrasts; a place of black deserts and white houses; limpid lagoons and rolling surf; soaring volcanoes and sweeping sandy beaches. It’s bleak and beautiful, stark and stunning. Unlike its bigger, brasher neighbours to the west – Tenerife and Grand Canaria – Lanzarote has refrained from selling out to stack-‘em-high-sell-‘em-cheap package holidays and favoured a more sustainable, intimate brand of tourism. It’s not devoid of big resorts and bustling beaches – with 300 days of sunshine annually the island has an obvious appeal amongst sun-seeking Europeans – but, despite this, Lanzarote has retained a traditional charm and authentic aesthetic that many find lacking elsewhere on the Canary archipelago. This is thanks largely to César Manrique, the late, great artist and architect who turned Lanzarote and its people onto the merits of sustainable development. Manrique is behind some of the island’s most revered attractions; from urban murals and intriguing art installations to cosy cave bars and verdant cactus gardens. Manrique’s legacy, not to mention Lanzarote’s stunning scenery, remain a big draw for travelling artists, who come from all over the world to visit the island. They tackle the local landscapes rather differently to the many sports enthusiasts, who come to test their mettle in what is considered to be one of Europe’s top outdoor destinations. It’s easy to see why Lanzarote has gained such a reputation; the island’s smooth, straight roads are a veritable paradise for cyclers, while its dried lava fields and lofty hiking trails offer perfect conditions for runners and ramblers. Of course, there's plenty of sand, sea and Sangria for those who want it, but ultimately, for most visitors, Lanzarote’s appeal lies not in its opportunities for boozy beach holidays, but in its untamed natural beauty, traditional charm and strong artistic heritage, which lure many back for repeat visits. 846 sq km (327 sq miles). 143,209 (2015). 169.3 per sq km. Arrecife.","The second oldest island in the Canary archipelago after Fuerteventura, Lanzarote rose from the sea during a massive volcanic eruption some 15 million years ago. Lanzarote was first inhabited from around 1000 BC by a primitive, pastoral tribe known as Majos. Constantly struggling for survival on an island short of resources, by the time the Europeans arrived the Majos had barely progressed beyond Stone Age conditions, living in caves, wearing animal skins and herding livestock. In 1402 Lanzarote was claimed by Juan de Béthencourt, marking the start of the Spanish conquest. After repeated pirate raids the depleted indigenous population was in no state to resist and welcomed their conquerors hoping they would bring protection against seafaring slavers. However, despite Spanish claims to the island, French and Moroccan pirates, as well as British buccaneers, continued to raid Lanzarote, inflicting misery on the handful of hardy inhabitants who remained. Already hard, life on the island got much worse in 1730 when it experienced one of the longest volcanic eruptions on record. For six dark years, Timanfaya billowed ash and lava, which blocked out the sunlight and destroyed a quarter of the island. However, life on Lanzarote improved immensely after the eruption, which left behind a thick layer of rich and fertile soil – a boon for local farmers, who prospered greatly by cultivating cash crops such as sugar cane, tobacco and cereal. By the 1970s, Lanzarote’s once thriving agricultural industry had fallen into decline; plantations were mothballed, production moved elsewhere. Luckily, the island’s fledgling tourism industry was able to pick up the slack thanks to a boom in commercial air travel – the doors to mass tourism had opened and Lanzarote has never looked back. Did you know? • Between 1730 and 1736, Lanzarote was under a heavy cloud of black, volcanic ash, which obscured the sun for six long years. • When pirates attacked the island during the 16th and 17th centuries, locals hid in the volcanic tubes of Cueva de Los Verdes, only emerging when the coast was, quite literally, clear. • In 2012 a scientific marine expedition found 15 fossilised teeth, which showed that the waters off La Graciosa were home to the largest predator that ever existed: the 20m-long (65.5ft), 100-tonne Megalodon shark, which has been extinct for approximately 3 million years. There is no official religion, but the majority of the population is Roman Catholic. Spanish life has undergone rapid change in recent decades and many of the stricter religious customs are giving way to more modern manners, particularly in the cities and among women. In spite of this, traditions remain strong; hospitality, chivalry and courtesy thrive. Handshaking is the customary form of greeting between men, while women to whom one has already been introduced may be greeted with a fleeting kiss to either cheek. Normal social courtesies should be observed when visiting someone's home and a small gift is always appreciated. The evening meal is taken late, generally 2100-2200. The Spanish have two family names; the maternal surname follows the paternal, but is rarely used outside a formal context. Conservative casual wear is widely acceptable. A black tie is only necessary for very formal occasions and is usually specified if required. Outside resorts, scanty beachwear should be confined to beach or poolside. Smoking has long been banned in offices, shops, schools, hospitals, cultural centres and on public transport, but in 2011 that ban was extended to all bars, cafes and restaurants. Spain now has one of the toughest anti-smoking laws in Europe.  The principal language is Spanish.","Lanzarote has a warm, pleasant climate throughout the year with annual average temperatures of around 22°C (78°F) and very little rainfall (averaging less than 16 days per year). December and January are the months when this rainfall is most likely to occur. The north of the island tends to be windier and more cloudy.Occasionally temperatures can soar to 40°C (104°F) and above when the sirocco wind brings hot, dry and sandy air from the Sahara. This can last from a few hours to a week. Lightweight, plus some wind protection according to the season. Lanzarote is the most northerly and the most easterly of the seven Canary Islands. The island lies in the Atlantic Ocean approximately 125km (78 miles) off the border between Morocco and Western Sahara, and 1,020km (634 miles) from the Iberian Peninsula. The highest point on Lanzarote is Peñas del Chache at 670m (2,198ft)."
europe,latvia,"Officially known as the Republic of Latvia, this small nation remained tucked behind the Iron Curtain until the early nineties. Today it is one of the most visited countries in the Baltics and lures visitors with its dramatic landscapes, rich heritage and vibrant capital, Riga. Declared European Capital of Culture in 2014, the city has one of the most impressive collections of art nouveau buildings in the world, not to mention a stunning UNESCO World Heritage downtown. The latter is home to medieval churches, grand Renaissance properties and a spectacular market, which is held inside defunct zeppelin hangers from WWI. The old town is dominated by Riga Cathedral, the largest medieval church in the Baltics and one of many attractions in Riga vying for visitors’ attention. The path beyond Riga is, for now, not quite so well-trodden. However, riches await those pressing further into the country; there’s the rural paradise of Rundāle Palace, the recently renovated Turaida Stone Castle and the charming Latvian Ethnographic Open-Air Museum. The beautifully preserved historic towns of Kuldīga and Cēsis also warrant excursions. Latvia is rich in natural attractions, too, like the Gulf of Riga and the windswept coastline along the Baltic Sea, which is home to seemingly infinite sandy shores. Jūrmala, a resort town just 40 minutes from Riga, boasts 26km (16 miles) of golden beaches lined with spas, thermal mud pools and seafood restaurants. Inland, national parks and nature reserves abound, but Gauja National Park is the most famous. This picturesque river valley is a place of unremitting beauty: rushing rivers, ancient sandstone cliffs and, in spring, masses of white cherry blossoms. Gauja National Park is not only great for hiking, cycling and watersports, but also offers one of the best birdwatching sites in Latvia, after Pape and Cape Kolka. While low cost air travel has opened Latvia to the masses, most visitors still struggle to venture beyond the capital. However, those who do find treasure in this country will, as the tourist board likes to say, discover it is “best enjoyed slowly.”   64,589 sq km (24,938 sq miles). 1,937,944 (UN estimate 2018). 30 per sq km (77 people/sq mile). Riga. Parliamentary Republic President Edgars Rinkēvičs since 2023. Prime Minister Evika Silina since 2023.","Latvia has, like neighbouring Estonia and Lithuania, been an important trading centre and strategic pawn in the Baltic region. The various Latvian tribes were self-governing until the end of the 13th century when Teutonic knights conquered the territory. Latvia was then subject to sporadic invasions by the Poles and the Swedes until the 18th century when Russia, under Peter the Great, emerged as a major European power. The entire territory of modern Latvia was under Russian control from 1795 until 1918, when the Latvian National Council proclaimed it a free state. That freedom didn’t last long though, and in 1940 the country was invaded by the Soviets. Nazi forces displaced them the following year before the Red Army invaded once again in 1944 when Latvia was incorporated into the Soviet Union. Protests against Soviet control and the campaign for democracy and independence began in 1986 and gathered pace with the formation of the Popular Front of Latvia in 1988. The Latvian parliament declared independence on 4 May 1990, a day still marked as a national holiday. Full independence was finally achieved following a referendum in 1991, with Latvia being admitted into the UN in September 1991. Latvia joined NATO in 2004 and was admitted into the EU – along with nine other states, including Estonia and Lithuania – later the same year. The Lat, Latvia’s currency since 1993, was then replaced by the Euro in January 2014. The suppression of the Latvian language and culture during the Soviet era has left a legacy of hostility – in some areas the ethnic Russian minority are subject to discrimination and, although there has been no serious conflict between the communities, it remains a delicate issue. The capital, Riga, was founded as a trading post in 1201 and has preserved many aspects of its long history, with architectural styles spanning eight centuries and a historic old town that was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1997. Riga was named European Capital of Culture in 2014 and remains an enticing destination for tourists. Majority Lutheran and Catholic, with a sizeable Russian Orthodox minority. Handshaking is customary when meeting someone for the first time. Latvians can be reserved and formal, but nevertheless very hospitable. They can also be quite direct, but do not generally mean to cause offence. Latvians are proud of their culture, and visitors should respect this strong sense of national identity. Latvian is the official language. Russian, English and German are widely spoken. Latvian belongs to the Baltic language group, part of the Indo-European language family. The language has three main dialects, with the Latgallian dialect, spoken in the eastern part of Latvia, especially distinctive.","To the west, the Latvian coast benefits from a maritime climate, while the hinterland in the east has a continental climate. Between June and September, days are pleasantly warm and often sunny. Winters are long and harsh, with temperatures in Riga rarely rising above freezing between December and March. Even in April they can be as low as 5ºC. Rainfall is distributed throughout the year with the heaviest rainfall in August. Snowfall is common in the winter months. Light to medium weight clothes are worn during summer months. Medium to heavyweight clothes are needed during spring and autumn, and heavyweights for the bitterly cold winter. Rainwear is advisable all year. Latvia is situated on the Baltic coast and borders Estonia in the north, Lithuania in the south, the Russian Federation in the east and Belarus in the southeast. The country is divided into five broad regions: Riga in the north, Kurzeme and Zemgale in the west and Vidzeme and Latgale in the east. The country is reasonably flat. A long sandy coastline is backed in places by undulating sand dunes and low sea cliffs. In Latgale, in the east, the landscape is noticeably different with rolling hills and myriad lakes. Wherever you are in Latvia you don't have to travel far to find dense forest. In addition the country boasts about 12,000 rivers. Latvia's longest river, the Daugava runs through Riga. Meanwhile, the Gauja River is at the heart of the country's best-known nature reserve, the Gauja National Park."
europe,liechtenstein,"A pocket-sized principality in the heart of Europe, Liechtenstein rarely tops anybody's bucket list of continental must-sees. Yet this tiny, landlocked nation offers more than you'd imagine: from long-standing history to sky-high mountains; cliff-hanging castles to odd cultural quirks. Many of Liechtenstein's historical highlights are located in the capital, Vaduz. While this tiny town may only have around 5,000 inhabitants, it also boasts an array of fascinating museums and galleries – including the Liechtenstein National Museum, the Museum of Fine Arts and the FIS Ski and Winter Sports Museum – as well as the atmospheric Prince's Wine Cellars and the neo-Gothic Vaduz Cathedral. All these attractions are watched over by the pretty Vaduz Castle, which remains the official residence of the Prince of Liechtenstein. Vaduz isn't Liechtenstein's only town of historical note. The second town, Schaan, is actually larger than Vaduz, and comes with its very own impressive church and Roman remains, while Balzers in the south west boasts what is perhaps Liechtenstein's most arresting fortification. There are also beautiful chapels to be found in lesser-visited villages like Triesen and Planken. And yet the true star of Liechtenstein is the remarkable nature. This country has arguably the most impressive landscape in Europe. Most of the peaks in Liechtenstein soar more than 2,000m (6,562ft) into the sky, making Liechtenstein a premier destination for skiing, hiking and mountain biking. Its shimmering lakes are also a big draw for swimmers. As well as its permanent attractions, Liechtenstein also excels when it comes to unusual events. Some of the fun annual highlights include the Monster Concert (where troupes of musicians and dancers dress in outlandish costumes and bang drums), the Cattle Drive (where cows and sheep are festooned in colourful garments and adorned with bells) and the LGT Alpine Marathon (where competitors from around the globe run for 26 miles through the mountains).

Prime Minister Daniel Risch since 2021.","Although this area of Europe is believed to have been inhabited for more than 7,500 years, the history of Liechtenstein as we know it today only really began in 1719 AD. That's when Holy Roman Emperor Charles VI granted the new territory to Anton Florian of Liechtenstein, recognising it as a principality, and as a sovereign member state of the Holy Roman Empire. The Napoleonic Wars during the early 19th century, which led to the fall of the Holy Roman Empire, effectively granted Liechtenstein further sovereignty, and during this century the fledgling state gradually grew its industry, financial institutions and military, though the latter was quickly disbanded (and it still doesn't have its own military). Until the end of World War I, Liechtenstein was closely allied with the Austrian Empire, and later Austria-Hungary, but after the war it signed a customs and monetary union with its other neighbour, Switzerland. Following Switzerland's lead, it remained neutral during the Second World War; though there were sympathies with the Nazi cause and it became a repository for Nazi gold and valuables. Since the 1970s, Liechtenstein has utilised its low corporate tax rates to attract international companies to the country, and has become a tax haven for countless high-profile individuals and organisations. This has allowed this small country to become one of the wealthiest in the world, and its population enjoys one of the highest standards of living anywhere on Earth. Hans-Adam II, the current Prince is Liechtenstein, is the world's sixth wealthiest monarch, worth an estimated US$5 billion. And this is in a country with a population of just 35,000. Did you know? • Liechtenstein is one of only two doubly-landlocked countries in the world (which means it is only surrounded by other landlocked countries). The other is Uzbekistan. • The total area of the country is just 46 sq m (120 sq km). • Grauspitz is the country's highest point, at 2,599m (8,527ft). The lowest is Ruggeller Riet at 430m (1,410m). It's still higher than anywhere in Holland. • Liechtenstein is the only German-speaking country not to border Germany. • The Prince is able to veto any legislation, except a referendum to become a republic. Christian, predominantly Roman Catholic. Similar to northwest Europe. The government is proposing a law on the protection of non-smokers with a smoking ban in publicly-accessible premises and in public administration buildings, this entails a smoking ban in restaurants in principle.

europe,lithuania,"Lithuania is a spellbinding land of castles, lakes and forests. Though relatively few knew of its charms until recently, Lithuania's capital, Vilnius, is one of Europe's most enchanting cities, owing especially to its Baroque old town. Then there is the Baltic shore, which may not have the sun-soaked appeal of other coasts, but is idyllic and largely unspoilt. The southernmost country in the Baltics, Lithuania is also home to vast plains parted by hills and sand dunes. Lithuanian independence came soon after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. By 1995, the transition to a full market economy had been completed. The long-running border dispute with Poland was settled with the signing of a friendship and co-operation treaty in January 1992 and negotiations with Russia led to the withdrawal of the remaining Russian troops in Lithuania in August 1993. The Russian connection remains, however, with Russians being the second largest ethnic minority in the country. The largest of the three Baltic states, Lithuania gaining EU membership in 2004, since which time the country has been thrust on to the global stage, encouraging more visitors than ever. Most of the attraction for Lithuania lies with its natural treasures. Much of the country is verdant, with several national parks that are perfect for hikers and explorers. All around the country there are countless sprawling forests ripe for wandering, as well as numerous lakes sprinkled across the landscape. Perhaps the country's trump card is the Baltic coastline, where beguiling wetlands brim with wildlife, most notably the thousands of bird species.

The formation of Lithuania dates back to around 1009 and the region has endured a series of invasions and conquests by neighbouring countries. In the 13th century the Kingdom of Lithuania was formed and was one of the largest areas in Europe to adopt Christianity. In 1795 Lithuania was taken over by the Russian Empire, and remain under its control until 1918 when it re-established itself as a democratic state. Its relatively brief life between the wars was dominated by border disputes with Poland and Germany as the former seized the Vilnius region in 1920 and Klaipėda, gained from the latter in 1923, was ceded following a Nazi ultimatum delivered in 1939. In World War 2 Lithuania was occupied first by Soviet Russia and then by the Nazis until 1944 when the Red Army re-occupied the territory. It's thougth some 780,000 Lithuanians lost their lives during the war, but although partisans fought a guerrilla action against the Red Army until as late as 1952 Lithuania remained a Soviet republic until the early 1990s when it became the first former Soviet republic to restore its independence and began to develop into an economically strong country. The last Soviet troops left Lithuania in August 1993. Lithuania is now a full member of the EU, as well as the Council of Europe, and adopted the euro as its currency in 2015. It signed up to the Schengen Agreement, effectively abolishing border controls between members. It also belongs to NATO and in 2013 became the first Baltic state to be elected to the United Nations Security Council. Since independence Lithuania has upheld its democracy and the current president, Dalia Grybauskaitė – its first female head of state – was elected for a second term in 2014. Lithuanians enjoy one of the lowest rates of income tax in Europe – just 15 per cent.

europe,luxembourg,"As the wealthiest nation in Europe and one of the founding fathers of the EU, it’s safe to say little Luxembourg is punching well above its weight. But as well as the highest per capita income on the continent, this diminutive country also has more than its fair share of natural beauty with rolling hills, verdant valleys and meandering rivers painting picture of rural idyll. Proud of its role as a founding member of the EU, Luxembourg plays a prominent position in European affairs and is home to a number of European Union institutions. Most of the action takes place in the capital, Luxembourg City, which has something of a split personality: while it’s all antiquated charm in the Old Town, with its elegant squares, imposing churches, independent shops and cobblestone streets, the Kirchberg district has a modern, flashier feel thanks to its ubiquitous offices, shopping malls and entertainment complexes. The most popular destination outside the capital is medieval Vianden in the northeast, with its cobbled streets and hilltop castle, which is the envy of many European cities. Vianden also hosts a range of festivals and events throughout the year, many of which celebrate its historical past. Echternach, founded in the 7th century, is the oldest city in the country, with a picturesque centre dominated by an abbey. It is also a convenient base for exploring ‘Little Switzerland’, a tiny region of rocky outcrops, cliffs, cascades, and forests, crisscrossed by walking trails that are a haven for hikers and mountain-bikers. On the southeastern border with Germany, the Moselle Valley enjoys a unique microclimate that has given rise to one of Europe’s smallest wine-growing districts, producing award-winning whites and sparkling wines. Meanwhile, northern Luxembourg is dominated by the Ardennes, an area of high plateau where wooded valleys, shimmering rivers and lofty peaks make for stunning trekking.

Still, Luxembourg has historically experienced commercial prosperity and the country has a cosmopolitan attitude, exemplified not only by the fact that the country has the highest percentage of foreigners of any EU country, but also by the trilingual ability of its people. During World War 2 Luxembourg sent a small group of volunteers who took part in the Normandy landings leading to the Duchy's eventual liberation from Nazi occupation in September 1944. A constitutional monarchy, Luxembourg's head of state is the Grand Duke – currently Henri – and since 2011 a system of absolute primogeniture has been in place permitting legitimate female descendants to be included in the line of succession. Luxembourg was a founder member of the European Community (having previously formed close economic ties with the Netherlands and Belgium) and was host to the European Parliament until its move to Brussels and Strasbourg. It remains the home of the Secretariat of the European Parliament. Luxembourg is in the mainstream on the current EU issues of monetary union, EU expansion, social policy and immigration and adopted the Euro upon its inception. Domestic politics are typical of Western European nations, with Christian Democrat and Socialist parties and a centrist Parti Démocratique (PD) represented in the National Assembly. More recently, the Greens and the right-wing Action Committee for Democracy and Pensions Justice (ADR) have also been represented and the current government is a coalition of the Parti Démocratique, the Greens and the Luxembourg Socialist Workers' Party. Luxembourg enjoys the world's highest GDP per capita and in 2016 its citizens have either visa-free or visa-on-arrival access to 172 countries. Did you know? • As a result of Grand Duke Henri's refusal to ratify a law to legalise euthanasia in 2008, the constitution was changed so that laws pass into statute without the Grand Duke's assent. • Prime Minister Xavier Bettel is openly gay, the first Luxembourg Prime Minister to be so. • Luxembourg won an Oscar in 2014 for the animated short film Mr Hublot. Around 87% of the population are Roman Catholic, but there are also significant Protestant, Anglican, Jewish and Muslim minority groups. Religious tolerance is widespread and there are few tensions between the different groups. Handshaking is the normal greeting for men and women on a first meeting. Once you are familiar with a person, three kisses on alternate cheeks is the normal greeting between men and women, and between women. The code of practice for visiting someone's home is similar to that of other Western European countries: it is common practice to give a small gift or flowers if you are invited for a meal. Smart-casual or casual dress is widely acceptable, but some dining rooms, clubs and social functions will demand more formal attire. Smoking is prohibited in most public areas, and since January 2014, the law has changed to explicitly prohibit smoking in cafés, bars and clubs. Some venues will still be able to offer separate smoking rooms. Following the trend across the rest of Western Europe and North America, the habit is also becoming less socially acceptable. Lëtzeburgesch, a German-Moselle-Frankish dialect, became the third officially recognised national language in 1984, joining French and German. Native-born Luxembourgers are trilingual. French and German are generally used for administrative and commercial purposes, and in the media, but many nationals will use Lëtzeburgesch at home and when socialising with one another. Reflecting the international make up of Luxembourg City and the fact that many residents are not native-born, French is the most common lingua franca in the capital. Many Luxembourgers also speak excellent English, especially in areas frequented by tourists.","Warm weather can generally be expected from May to September. Snow is not uncommon during the winter months, especially in the higher Ardennes regions in the northern half of the country, but this is less reliable than it once was, and has led to the virtual eradication of the former (albeit small) cross-country skiing industry. The north (the Ardennes region) tends to be slightly wetter and slightly colder than the south at all times of year. As has been seen in other regions, weather patterns have become far less predictable in recent years than they used to be, and visitors should be braced for anything whenever they travel. Restaurants, hotels and most visitor attractions in Luxembourg City remain open all year round, and there is no specific high or low season, although certain peak times such as the National Day in June, Easter and Christmas can become booked out well in advance. Many other parts of the country however experience a very distinct low season in January and February, and tourist grinds to a halt in much of the Ardennes. Many smaller hotels and some restaurants shut completely during the winter months, and establishments that remain open often have limited opening hours. Autumn can be a good time to visit the north as the annual turning of the leaves is a wonderful and free natural spectacle, many country hotels have open fires going, and the restaurants offer seasonal menus featuring local game. Waterproofs are advisable at all times of the year. There is no discernible wet or dry season in Luxembourg, and it is best to come prepared for all eventualities. The Grand Duchy of Luxembourg shares borders to the north and west with Belgium, to the south with France and to the east with Germany. Although similar in size to a typical English county, there are a number of distinct geographical regions. Most of the northern half of the country is made up of the high plateau of the Ardennes, carved and scarred by a network of steep-sided thickly forested river valleys. Most of this region is around 500m (1,640ft) above sea level. The southern half – known locally the Gutland or Good Land - is gently rolling lowland, covered with woods and farmland, mostly sitting around 250m (820ft) above sea level. There are no towns of any significant size in the north; the south is more urbanised. In the southeast is the rich wine-growing valley of the Moselle river, which enjoys a unique microclimate well-suited to the cultivation of grapes. The area around Echternach, Larochette and Beaufort is a spectacular region of narrow sandstone micro-gorges and thick forest, which was christened ‘Little Switzerland’ by early tourists. The capital meanwhile, Luxembourg City, is built on a rocky outcrop overlooking the two adjoining gorges of the Alzette and Pétrusse valleys."
europe,portugal,"The “Pearl of the Atlantic,” Madeira is more than just a shortcut to the tropics for European holidaymakers. A land of luscious mountains, limpid lagoons and gorgeous fishing villages, this Portuguese archipelago is a destination of staggering natural beauty. Floating off the coast of West Africa, Madeira’s landscapes are indebted to the rich volcanic soil, mild climate and abundant rainfall that support an exceptional diversity of flora. Botanists take particular delight in the archipelago’s laurisilva forests, which are inscribed on UNESCO’s list of World Heritage Sites. As well as being home to exceptional flora, Madeira has spectacular fauna, with the warm Atlantic Ocean proving the perfect habitat for marine life. The ocean offers many opportunities for adventurous travellers; from swimming with dolphins to scuba diving. Whale watching and surfing are other major selling points. Golden sandy beaches are few on Madeira, found only at Calheta and Machico, and both of those have been built from imported sand. Elsewhere beaches consist of small strips of black, volcanic sand, which is enough for some. On land, the fragrant eucalyptus woodlands are an ideal place for hiking, offering stunning views. But perhaps the most distinctive characteristic of Madeira is its renowned system of water channels, known as levadas. Constructed by slaves to convey water from the mountains to plantations, walking the levadas has become a major tourist attraction for Madeira. Despite the lack of beach space, Madeira remains popular with foreign visitors and its coastal resorts are geared to the demands of the modern tourist, most of which arrive via the capital, Funchal, which overlooks one of the world’s most beautiful bays. Here you can relax at one of the many cafés, order a glass of Madeira wine and let the archipelago’s charms work their magic; you won't be disappointed. 741 sq km (286 sq miles). 258,686 (2014). 359.1 per sq km.

President Miguel Albuquerque since 2015.","When the Portuguese patron of exploration, Prince Henry 'the Navigator', gathered together the finest cartographers early in the 15th century, his plan was to extend the country’s collective knowledge of the coast of West Africa. He enlisted the services of two young captains, João Gonçalves Zarco and Tristão Vaz Teixeira, who were blown off course on their journey. After many days at sea they found land in the form of a small island which they named Porto Santo. On reporting to their prince, they were promptly ordered to return and colonise the island. The year was 1419. Today, it seems incredible that it took a further year before the discovery of the much larger island of Madeira was made. The captains had reported a dark mass of clouds visible on the southern horizon, and were encouraged to explore further afield. As they approached, the huge Atlantic rollers breaking along the north coast and the turmoil of the currents at Ponta de São Lourenço would have done nothing to subdue the anxieties of the superstitious sailors. But on rounding the headland they discovered the bay of Machico, the gateway to the densely forested island that they named Madeira – the name means 'wood'. Prince Henry immediately organised the colonisation of the island. Sugarcane became the main driver for economic growth in the 15th and 16th century. Early settlers found the island’s climate perfect for cultivating this cash crop, which was harvested using slave labour. When the sugar industry migrated to South America, wine became the main industry. Portugal briefly lost control of the islands when the British occupied them during the Napoleonic Wars. However, they were somewhat reluctantly handed back to the Portuguese in 1814, who governed them until the Carnation Revolution of 1974. Since then Madeira has enjoyed political autonomy from the mainland. Did you know? • Former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill was a regular visitor to the fishing village of Camara de Lobos, which he liked to paint. • Christopher Columbus married Filipa Moniz on the Madeira archipelago in 1478 – sadly, she died a short time later giving birth to their son. • The effects of WWI on Portugal were first felt in Funchal, which was shelled for two hours by German U-boats in 1916. Roman Catholics make up the vast majority of the population in Madeira, but there is also a small protestant community. Madeirans are warm, hospitable people who revel in exhibitions, films, crafts, concerts, plays and café culture. The summer festival season is a particularly pleasant experience, with carnivals and other jamborees celebrating the archipelago's culture and produce. Casual wear is widely acceptable, but you shouldn't wear beach clothing in towns. Smoking has been prohibited in public indoor spaces since 2008 and the ban includes cinemas, theatres and buses. Some bars and restaurants have special licenses permitting diners and drinkers to smoke inside. European Portuguese is spoken throughout Madeira, but English is also widely spoken.","Mild climate with warm summers and extremely mild winters. Mid-seasonal wear. The group comprises the main island of Madeira, the smaller island of Porto Santo, the three uninhabited islets of Ilheu Chao, Deserta Grande and Ilheu de Bugio, and the Selvagens (a group of uninhabited islets located south of Madeira). The islands are hilly and of volcanic origin and the coast of Madeira is steep and rocky with deep eroded lava gorges running down to the sea. These are particularly impressive on the north coast of Madeira island. The largest of a group of five islands formed by volcanic eruption, Madeira is in fact the summit of a mountain range rising 6.5km (4 miles) from the sea bed. At Cabo Girão, west of the capital of Funchal, is the second-highest cliff in the world. Inland, Pico Ruivo is the island's highest point (1,862m/6,109ft) with the slightly lower Pico de Arieiro (1,810m/5,940ft) nearby. Both are destinations for sightseeing tours, commanding fine views of the surrounding mountains. Madeira's volcanic origin means that it has no sandy beaches, although there is a small beach, Prainha, near the whaling village of Canical on the extreme east of the island. Madeira itself is 56km (35 miles) long and 21km (13 miles) wide. Porto Santo is much smaller, only 14km (9 miles) long and 5km (3 miles) wide, with a long, golden sandy beach."
europe,spain,"It doesn’t take a genius to work out why Mallorca endures as one of Europe’s top destinations. Clean beaches? Check. Upmarket resorts? Check. Reliable weather? Check. It has all the hallmarks of a sizzling summer holiday. Resorts big and small can be found along much of the coast, offering everything from tranquil getaways to raucous fun in the sun. Mega yachts, small sailboats and wooden fishing boats ply the waters around the island. But Mallorca is more than just a beach destination. In recent years the island’s capital, Palma, has developed into one of Spain’s most beguiling small cities. Fronted by the beautifully imposing cathedral and royal palace, its narrow cobbled lanes weave away from the seafront into the heart of the old city, where pedestrianised shopping streets, charming squares, ancient courtyards and chic bars attract locals and foreigners alike. As well as its vibrant nightlife, Palma boasts a strong arts scene. Excellent food abounds in Mallorca. Seafood predominates in coastal resorts, while regional dishes are served in traditional restaurants throughout the island. The restaurant scene is thriving in Palma, where foodies can quaff anything from local cuisine to Japanese fare. Head inland and a completely different (and much less touristy) picture of Mallorca emerges. Traditional villages lie scattered across the countryside, sheep bells tinkle, white almond blossom floats in the air and a rural tranquillity prevails. The central plain is the agricultural heart of the island, with vineyards, sleepy hamlets and weekly markets. Along the west coast, the great Sierra de Tramuntana mountains, covered in pine forests, tower over the plains, their sharp cliffs looming large above the deep blue sea. It’s the Spain of yesteryear and it should not be missed. 3,640 sq km (1,405 sq miles). 882,964 (INE value 2016). 236.1 per sq km. Palma de Mallorca. Parliamentary monarchy since 1978. King Felipe VI since 2014. Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy since 2011.","Owing to its central location on the ancient Mediterranean trading route, the island of Mallorca has seen its share of conquerors, invaders and settlers over the centuries. The first settlers are dated to at least 3000 BC, but this was small scale. Later the Greeks and the Phoenicians set up trading posts on the island, which then became part of the Carthaginian trading empire from North Africa. But it wasn’t until the Roman period that the island was settled in any great numbers. In 123 BC the Romans conquered the island, and for almost 600 years Mallorca’s life and prosperity was intricately linked with Rome. Two main centres emerged, Pollentia (today Alcúdia) and Palma. In the 5th century AD, Mallorca (and the other Balearic islands) were conquered by the Vandal Kingdom of Africa, who demolished much of the Roman infrastructure. In 534 AD the islands became part of the Byzantine Empire. As the spread of Islam in the 7th century reached North Africa, the Moors conquered Spain and shortly after, the Balearics. Four hundred years of Arab dominance followed, and while they were eventually ousted by King Jaume I, who annexed the island to his Kingdom of Aragon (thus making Mallorca part of the Catalan empire), some of their influence still remains in local culture and tradition. A prosperous era followed, to which many of the island’s most important buildings, including Bellver Castle, the Almudaina Palace and the Convent of Sant Francese, owe their origins. During the Spanish Civil War, Mallorca was attacked by the Republicans for being a nationalist stronghold. What became known as the Battle of Mallorca in August 1936 saw the nationalists ultimately succeed in defending the island. Since the 1950s, Mallorca has been one of Europe’s first and most popular tourist destinations. Mass tourism throughout the following three decades saw Mallorca’s resorts boom, but it unfortunately got a reputation as a cheap, sun holiday for lager louts. A clean-up operation has seen the island enter a new phase of sophisticated tourism. Over 13 million tourists visit Mallorca each year. Did you know? • Mallorca is one of the world's most important training locations for professional cyclists. • The name Mallorca comes from the Latin for 'larger one', as opposed to Minorca, the 'smaller one' • Chopin, George Sand and Robert Graves all lived on Mallorca in the picturesque villages of Deia and Valldemossa. There is no official religion, but the majority of the population is Roman Catholic. Much of the population is practicing, and Sunday church visits and holy communions play an important part of daily life. Spanish life has undergone rapid change in recent decades and many of the stricter religious customs are giving way to modernity, particularly in the cities and among women. In spite of this, traditions remain strong; hospitality, chivalry and courtesy thrive. Handshaking is the customary form of greeting between men, while women to whom one has already been introduced may be greeted with a fleeting kiss to either cheek. Normal social courtesies should be observed when visiting someone's home and a small gift is always appreciated.  The evening meal is taken late, generally 2100-2200, and bars and nightclubs don’t get busy until the small hours of the morning. A law banning smoking in offices, shops, schools, hospitals, cultural centres and on public transport was introduced on 1 January 2006, although smoking in bars and restaurants was not strongly prohibited until 2011. The official language is Catalan (spoken as the local dialect Mallorquín), although Spanish is of course also spoken by all residents. English and German are widely spoken in all tourist destinations, and most literature aimed at tourists can be found in these four languages as a minimum.","The island enjoys a temperate, Mediterranean climate. The height of summer can get very hot – in excess of 40°C - but the cooling influence of the sea means it's seldom excessively uncomfortable or humid. Summer is the busiest time of the year and prices are at their highest in July and August. During the rest of the year Mallorca has an ideal climate, with comfortable temperatures in the mid- to high-twenties during the spring and autumn months. Combined with fewer visitors and lower hotel prices, this makes for the best time to visit and is also the best time for outdoor activities such as cycling and hiking holidays. The climate during the winter is generally mild and dry with occasional showers, making Mallorca an ideal winter getaway. The shoulder seasons (April-May and September-October) are generally the perfect time to get the best of the weather and to avoid the crowds. The summer months are extremely hot so lightweight clothing is needed. Long-sleeved cotton tops are recommended as they protect from the fierce sun, especially for sightseeing or activities. Autumn and spring attire should be medium-weight clothing, mainly layers, with some light rainwear, while the winters can be cold so a good jacket, scarf and gloves might be necessary. Located in the middle of the Mediterranean Sea, approximately 210km (130 miles) south of Barcelona and 300km (185 miles) north of the African continent (Algeria), Mallorca has an idyllic geographical setting. Measuring 3,640 sq km (1,405 sq miles), it is the largest of the four Balearic Islands (Ibiza and Formentera to the west and Menorca to the east) and has a hugely varied landscape. Its main geographical feature is the Sierra de Tramuntana mountain range, which extends from the southwest to northeast of the island over 70km (44 miles), the highest peak being Puig Major at 1,445m (4,741ft). The coast is mainly rocky, pocketed with small coves, sandy beaches and caves. Three large bays provide shelter from the open seas – Palma Bay, Alcúdia Bay and Pollensa Bay. The interior of the island is covered with lush pine forest, olive and almond trees, and in the central plains agricultural terrain and vineyards. Protected nature reserves are important for wildlife, the most significant of these being the Cabrera Island Marine Reserve and the S’Albufera Nature Reserve near Alcúdia. There are hundreds of bird species that call Mallorca home, although wild mammals are today rare, the main exception being the wild goat that can be seen in the mountainous regions."
europe,malta,"Malta is a relatively small archipelago consisting of three islands (Malta, Gozo and Comino) and other uninhabited islands. It has an area of 316 sq km (122 sq miles), which is roughly the same size as Munich. Although small in size, Malta has bags of character for visitors at every turn – secluded bays, buzzing nightclubs, exhilarating activities and amazing archaeological wonders all await visitors. Most tourists come for the weather (there are more than 300 days of sunshine annually) and crystalline waters, which make it one of the best beach holiday destinations in Europe. The best beaches in Malta include the secluded Fomm ir-Rih, the popular Mellieha Bay, the red-sandy Ramla Bay (in Gozo), the breath-taking Blue Lagoon (in Comino), to name but a few. All three islands also fantastic diving experiences and top diving sites include The Blue Hole, Ghar Lapsi and Qawra Reef, along with seven conservation areas around wrecks: • The Um el Faroud in Wied Iż-Żurrieq • MV Xlendi, Cominoland, Karwela off Xatt l-Aħmar • Tug St Michael, Tug 10 in Marsaskala • The Imperial Eagle off Qawra Point • Rożi, P29 off Ċirkewwa • Blenheim Bomber off Xrobb l-Għaġin • Bristol Beaufighter off Exiles Point For history buffs, Malta's distinctive appeal lies in its extraordinary 7,000 years of history. This small island is situated in the central Mediterranean, making it a strategic base since the earliest days of navigation and attracting settlers to come and flourish. Today, it is easy for visitors to find mysteries from the Neolithic period, as well as historic marks left by the Phoenicians, Carthaginians, Romans, Byzantines, Arabs, The Knights of St John (aka Knights Hospitaller or Order of St John), and more recently the French and British. Because the past is well-preserved and visible today, Malta has been described as one big 'open-air museum'. 316 sq km (122 sq miles). 460,297 (UN estimate 2018). 1,354 per sq km. Valletta. Republic. President Myriam Spiteri Debono since 2024. Prime Minister Robert Abela since 2020.","Malta's position in the central Mediterranean has made it an important strategic base for many different powers and meant that it has been subject to many invasions throughout the ages. A multitude of civilisations has occupied the island, notably the Phoenicians, Carthaginians, Romans, Byzantines, Arabs and Sicilians from the 8th century BCE to the Middle Ages. Malta's human history stretches far beyond all of these invaders though, with a number of megalithic temples dating back to 4th and 3rd millennium BCE when the Neolithic people arrived and settled on the island. Today, the UNESCO-listed Megalithic Temples of Malta consist of six ancient buildings (Ġgantija, Ħaġar Qim, Mnajdra, Skorba, Ta' Ħaġrat and Tarxien) and they are well worth a visit. The history of Malta is also deeply associated with the Knights of St John who ruled Malta from 1530 to 1798. During this time, Malta was a bulwark against the Ottoman ambitions in Europe. The power of the knights ended in 1798 when Napoleon invaded in 1798. In 1800, Malta became a protectorate of the British Empire voluntarily. The most famous episode in Malta's recent history was the heroic defence of the island during WWII, which saw the island held under siege by the Axis between 1940 and 1942. The nation was awarded the George Cross for its role in the war. Since achieving independence from Britain in 1964, Malta has been stable with domestic issues dominating its internal politics. Malta became a republic in 1974 and a member of the European Union in 2004. It adopted the euro in 2008 and has flourished since, both politically and commercially, with vast sums of money being invested in infrastructure and roads. Malta rejoined NATO’s Partnership for Peace in 2009 and remains committed to its neutral status. Did you know? •	Some 3,000 bombing raids were made on Malta by Italian and German air forces during WWII. •	Malta's Calypso Cave is believed to be the same cave Homer mentioned in The Odyssey. •	Malta has two co-official languages – English and Maltese. The latter tongue is closely related to the medieval Sicilian dialect of Arabic, although it has gradually been Latinised over the centuries, and there are many English loan words. 95% Roman Catholic, with the remaining 5% divided between Anglican, Church of Scotland, Greek Orthodox, Jewish, Methodists and Muslim. The usual European courtesies are expected, but the visitor should also bear in mind the tremendous importance of Roman Catholicism; if visiting a church, for instance, modest dress covering the shoulders and legs will be expected. Smoking is prohibited on public transport and in all public buildings, including cinemas, restaurants and bars. Maltese (a Semitic language) and English are the official languages. Italian is also widely spoken.","Malta enjoys a Mediterranean climate with hot summers and mild winters. Spring (March to May) sees the number of rainy days gradually drops from nine days in March to three days in May, while the average high goes from 18°C (64°F) in March to 24°C (75°F) in May. This means that May is a good time to visit Malta if you want warm weather and have the opportunity to enjoy tourist attractions without large crowds. Summer (June to August) is peak season and the best time to enjoy a beach holiday in Malta, as rainfall is at its minimum and sunshine is abundant. However, it also means tourist hotspots are thronged with sun worshippers. In July and August, the average high is 32°C (90°F). Autumn (September to November) sees rainfall goes from 40mm (1.6 inches) to 109mm (4.3 inches) as the season progresses. The first half of the season still feels like summer, but by November, the average high is 21°C (70°F). Winter (December to February) is mild, rainy and windy. In January, the average high is 16°C (61°F). Lightweight cottons and linens are worn between April and September, although warmer clothes may occasionally be necessary on cooler evenings. A light raincoat is advisable from October to March. The Maltese archipelago is situated in the centre of the Mediterranean with three inhabited islands – Malta, Gozo and Comino. Malta is the largest inhabited island, lying 97km (60 miles) south of Pozzallo (Sicily) and 363km (226 miles) north of Sfax (Tunisia). Valletta, the country's capital on the southeast side, is the cultural and commercial hub of Malta. The island has a largely rugged coastline, indented with harbours, bays, creeks, sandy beaches and rocky coves. It has no mountains or rivers. Gozo is north of Malta. It is more verdant, with many flat-topped hills and craggy cliffs. You can take a ferry from Cirkewwa in Malta to Mgarr in Gozo (journey time is about 20 minutes). Comino sits between Malta and Gozo and is sparsely populated. Comino Ferries Co-op operates services from Marfa and Cirkewwa (Malta) to the Blue Lagoon on Comino Island. Bella Comino Ferries operates the route between Gozo and Comino."
europe,spain,"Less developed and more tranquil than the other Balearic Islands, Menorca appeals to those in search of relaxed sunny days far from the hustle and bustle. Hazy beach life is well and truly at the fore of the island’s draw, with an abundance of sandy strips perfect for lazing in the heat. Across the island its Bronze Age past is still evident with Talayots sites, like the impressive ruins at Talato de Dalt. But it is the British influence (a result of the island’s capture in 1708) that has left a more lasting impression. In the capital, Mahon, Georgian architecture remains a fixture among the old city walls, cliff top churches and tiny squares. It was here, under the influence of 18th century British sailors, that the island’s renowned gin production began. Steep streets are a feature of the small capital, with all roads (seemingly) leading down to the turquoise sea. Portside visitors bob around an abundance of cafes, bars and restaurants, all well-served by the views of yachts and large liners making their way out to the Mediterranean Sea. Menorca’s most attractive town is Ciutadella, just 32km (20 miles) from Mahon. Centred around Plaça des Born, its architecture is markedly Spanish, and a walk through the narrow cobbled streets of its Old Town reveal baroque churches and gothic touches that seem unmarked by modernity. Island-wide, small-scale holiday developments have remained largely self-contained, leaving most of Menorca uncommercialised and bucolic. Early introductions of conservation areas proved a shrewd move, protecting not only the island’s natural beauty, but also bringing Menorca sustainable tourism and UNESCO Biosphere Reserve status. As a result, the island's most striking features remain its beaches – a glorious girdle of golden white coves and aquamarine waters, particularly in the south – which attract young and not-so-young families year after year. 694 sq km (268 sq miles). 92,348 (2015). 133.1 per sq km.

europe,moldova,"Moldova is a largely overlooked destination, as yet untouched by the budget airline brigade. But it shouldn't be. In this land-locked Eastern European country, you can wander round vast monasteries, trek through ancient forests, or sample the local wines. Rich with history and fertile soils that produce abundant vineyards, Moldova is a special country despite its lack of fame, and one well worth getting to know. Despite remaining one of the poorest countries in Europe, the people are friendly and welcoming, and the main hubs, such as the capital Chişinău, have everything a visitor could need. Although few outsiders have heard about it as a viable city break destination, Chişinău has plenty going on. There's a buzzing cafe-bar and restaurant scene, while its cathedrals, monuments and museums have survived despite the city taking a serious pounding from aerial bombardments during World War II. One such survivor not to miss is the house where the writer Pushkin spent his days in exile penning some of his most famous works. The most obvious selling point of Moldova is probably that it's almost the least known spot in Europe. With only a few thousand visiting the country in every year – even neighbouring Romania and Ukraine see far higher foreign footfall – it's mainly favoured by intrepid backpacking completists. But there's much more to the country than this. A largely unspoilt, natural hinterland with plenty in the way of traditional culture and village life still going, Moldova can feel like a fragment of old Europe, at least if you get beyond the cities. Cross the Dniestr River, and you'll find yourself in the beguiling separatist Russian-speaking province of Transdniestr, all Soviet architecture and Lenin busts. Then there's the wine. The Moldovan grape's slowly fermenting fame means that the wine tourism industry is just beginning to emerge. The upshot? You can try one of Europe's best, most unique wines in a hidden land that will surely have more than its fair of tourists in the years to come. 33,800 sq km (13,050 sq miles). 4,062,862 (UN estimate 2016). 104.9 per sq km. Chisinau (Kishinev). Republic. President Maia Sandu since 2020. Prime Minister Dorin Recean since 2023.","Having declared its independence from the Soviet Union in August 1991 – and gained formal recognition by the United Nations a year later – Moldova is now well established as a European nation. The region has been inhabited since Palaeolithic times, more than a million years ago, and during the Stone Age its population farmed, hunted and made distinctive pottery. The first millennium saw the area occupied by various outside forces including Goths, Huns, Avars, Magyars, Cumans, Mongols and Tatars before the Principality of Moldova was established in 1359. For most of the 19th century Moldova was split between the Ottoman Empire, Romania and Russia, then in the wake of the Russian Revolution the region voted to become part of Romania. The new Soviet Union objected and by 1924 had brought it within Moscow’s orbit. Under the terms of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact in 1940 Moldova was occupied by Soviet troops before the Nazi invasion of the USSR put it first under German control then Romanian. The Red Army overran it in 1944 and the Moscow government began its policy of detaching Moldova from its Romanian roots. Change gathered pace with the instigation of Gorbachev’s reform programme and by the late 1980s Moldova started to move towards independence. Since the early-1990s, Moldovan politics have been dominated by the sometimes-violent friction between the Transnistria region – a sliver of land to the east of the Dniester River mainly populated by ethnic Russians – and the rest of the country. Attached to Moldova by Stalinist social engineering, Transnistria remains essential to Moldova for economic reasons but is run by its own parliament even though the United Nations considers it to be part of Moldova. In 2014, following the example of the controversial annexation of Crimea by Russian forces, the breakaway Transnistrian government asked to join the Russian Federation and in July 2015 mobilised men aged 18-27 amid fears it could become an East-West flashpoint. Did you know? •	Moldova has competed in the Eurovision Song Contest since 2005, with the pelvic-thrusting antics of Sergy Stepanov, sax player with the band SunStroke Project, achieving viral status in 2010. •	The national sport is tranta, a form of upright wrestling. •	It is estimated that up to one million Moldovans are working abroad. Mostly Eastern Orthodox Christian and other Christian denominations. A small amount of the population are Jewish. Dress should be casual but conservative. For official engagements, men should wear a jacket and tie. Moldovan (official), although considered to be virtually identical to Romanian.

Mediumweights, thick coat and waterproof shoes for winter; lightweights for summer. A light raincoat is useful. Moldova is a small landlocked state in southeastern Europe - one of the most highly populated republics of the former USSR. To the north, east and south, Moldova is bound by Ukraine; to the west by Romania. The River Prut constitutes the border with Romania. The country has rich pastures and wooded slopes, ideal for wine-growing."
europe,monaco,"From the multi-million pound yachts glinting in Monte Carlo harbour, to the endless flow of golden champagne, Monaco oozes privilege. Celebrities flock to this Mediterranean members-only club, with its opulent lifestyle, discreet banking facilities and heavily policed streets. There's more to this 200-hectare principality than meets the eye, though, with some terrific restaurants and an interesting history that continues to beguile to this day. In this, the second smallest country after the Vatican, natives still speak the Monégasque dialect, which sits somewhere between French and Italian. Meanwhile, Monaco's citizens famously don't have to pay taxes, which has partly made it an attractive place to live for some of the world's richest people. For visitors wishing to bask in some Monaco glitz, there are big annual events such as the Tennis Masters Series in April and the Formula 1 Grand Prix in May. Other festivals include the Monaco International Non Violent Film Festival, the Monte Carlo Opera and the annual Spring Arts Festival. In Monaco, you can expect plenty of luxury hotel towers, glamorous nightclubs and grand casinos. The latter attraction is tied up with the modern fate of Monaco. The tiny country's history of gambling dates back to the 1850s when the head of state commissioned the building of a casino to provide him with income, without having to increase taxes on his citizens. At first, the casino remained bizarrely empty, until a railroad connected Monaco with the rest of the world. It was soon doing so well that the principality was able to do away with taxes altogether. Overnight, Monaco became popular for Europe's most hedonistic elites, who came for the ever-flowing champagne and renowned opera productions. Away from the glamour, Monaco's balmy climate and seaside location make it a naturally beautiful place to visit. You can enjoy scenic walking routes along pretty costal bays, and stop for a drink at many al fresco cafés. For those with a couple of days to spare, Provence, the French Riviera and Italy are all within easy reach. 2 sq km (0.8 sq miles). 37,863 (UN estimate 2016). 18,865.5 per sq km. Monaco. Constitutional monarchy. Prince Albert II since 2005. Minister of State Pierre Dartout since 2020.","The history of Monaco is inseparable from that of the House of Grimaldi, who descended from Genoa and rose to prominence during the 12th century. In the late-13th century, with the Holy Roman Empire rife with internal strife, the Grimaldis took refuge in Provence where François Grimaldi led a group of partisans into the fortress of Monaco in 1297. The family has ruled the region ever since, preserving its independence through a mixture of good luck and cunning diplomacy. At various times, they were allied to almost every power in the region, particularly during the Italian Wars in the late-15th and early-16th centuries. Monaco is ideally placed geographically to either help or hinder the repeated attempts by French kings to conquer Italy. The principality’s Machiavellian diplomacy was richly rewarded in 1612 when Honoré II was granted the title of prince by the French Crown. He signed a treaty of friendship with France and Monaco has been independent ever since, with a brief interruption during the French Revolution. The Grimaldi motto – 'DeoJuvante' (‘With God's Help’) – provides another possible explanation for the survival of this tiny country, which became an independent state under French protection in 1861. Paris has long since maintained a firm grip on the principality through its ambassador and key appointees in the executive and judiciary. In 1993, Monaco joined the United Nations, becoming its smallest member and in 2004 joined the Council of Europe. It is not a formal member of the EU but does follow various EU policies, notably in customs and border control. Its principal attraction to the outside world lies in the provision of tax concessions and discreet banking facilities and this has periodically led to spats with France and the international community. Monaco is a constitutional monarchy and following the death of Prince Rainier in 2005, his son Prince Albert II was enthroned as head of state. In 2010 he appointed a Frenchman, Michel Roger, as Minister of State, the head of government. Do you know? •	Angered by its tax haven status, President Charles de Gaulle ordered the blockade of Monaco in 1963. •	Monaco is the world’s second smallest country by area. •	The principality has no navy or air force, but with 515 officers for 36,000 inhabitants, it does have one of the largest per capita police forces in the world. 95% Roman Catholic (Monaco has a Catholic Bishop), with Anglican minorities. Casual wear is acceptable for daytime and dress is the same as for the rest of the French Riviera. Smart restaurants, dining rooms, clubs and the casino's private rooms require more formal attire. Handshaking and, more familiarly, kissing both cheeks, are accepted forms of greeting. French. Monégasque (a mixture of French Provençal and Italian Ligurian), English and Italian are also spoken. Native Monégasques make up only a minority of Monaco's population.","Monaco has a mild climate throughout the year, the hottest months being July and August, and the coolest being January and February. Rain mostly falls during the cooler winter months and there is an average of only 60 days' rain per year. Lightweights are worn, with a warm wrap for cooler summer evenings. Light- to mediumweights are advised for winter. Monaco is second only to the Vatican as the smallest independent state in Europe. Set on the Mediterranean coast of France just a few miles from the Italian border, the country is a narrow ribbon of coastline backed by the Alpes-Maritimes foothills, creating a natural amphitheatre overlooking the sea. Monaco-Ville is set on a rocky promontory dominating the coast. The Palace is the home of the Grimaldi family, the oldest ruling house in Europe. Monaco-Ville also boasts a fine Romanesque cathedral among its other attractions. La Condamine is the area around the Port, while Monte-Carlo is the main centre for business and entertainment. Fontvieille has been set aside as an area for new light industrial and residential development."
europe,montenegro,"Montenegro remains one of Europe’s hidden gems… but for how much longer? Independent since 2006, the country has been quietly developing its fledgling tourism industry and is now being vaunted as one of the continent’s hottest new destinations. So what does this nascent nation have to offer? Well, inland it’s all pine-scented mountains, rolling prairies and traditional, stone villages, which are a joy for hikers, bikers and nature lovers. The star attraction, though, is the blissful, 293km (183mile) coastline, which gives onto the calm blue waters of the Adriatic Sea. The most popular coastal destinations are the enchanting Venetian-era port towns of Kotor and Budva, with their medieval stone buildings, family-run seafood restaurants and burgeoning hotel scene. Other less developed seaside towns include Herceg Novi, Petrovac, Bar and Ulcinj, where travellers can get a taste of local life. The coastline harbours a pleasing combination of long sandy beaches to the south, near Ulcinj, curving pebble bays along the so-called Budva Riviera, and little coves around the perimeter of the meandering Bay of Kotor to the north. As investment arrives, luxury marina-resorts have begun to spring up, offering mooring facilities for sailing boats as well as accommodation, restaurants, cafes, spas and shops. Porto Montenegro in Tivat is designed to accommodate some of the world’s biggest mega yachts and is indicative of the kind of travellers Montenegro seems to be targeting. Of course, it’s not all about wealthy oligarchs. Particularly inland, where travellers can grab a slice of traditional Balkan life and lose themselves in rugged mountains, many of which rise above 2,000m (6,560ft). The hinterland is also home to five national parks. Go in search of bears, wolves and lynx atop the peaks of Durmitor National Park; raft down the River Tara in Europe's deepest canyon; explore Europe's last virgin forest within Biogradska Gora National Park; or go bird watching in the wetlands of Lake Skadar National Park. But go now, before everyone else gets the same idea. 13,812 sq km (5,333 sq miles). 626,101 (UN estimate 2016). 47.8 per sq km. Podgorica. Republic. President Jakov Milatović since 2023. Prime Minister Milojko Spajic since 2023.","Montenegro is often considered a new country, having only gained independence from Serbia in 2006. However, its history goes back millennia, and it is closely intertwined with that of its Balkan neighbours. Montenegro's first known inhabitants were the Illyrians, a warlike Bronze Age people present along much of the East Adriatic coast. The Ancient Greeks arrived in the 4th century BC, founding the coastal town of Budva, though by the 1st century AD the entire area was absorbed into Roman Empire. It is around this point that the Illyrians proper were extinct. The Slavs arrived in the 7th century, mixed with descendants of the Romanised Illyrians, and adopted Christianity. A proud warrior people, they lived in clans, established their own royal family and secured independence from the Byzantines in the 11th century. The Slavs inhabited much of present-day Montenegro, then known as Duklja, which became the front line in various wars between the Byzantine Empire and Serbian Kingdom. In 1186, Duklja, which had been weakened by infighting, was incorporated into the Serbian Kingdom. The Serbian Empire, which evolved from the Serbian Kingdom, fell apart in the 14th century allowing the region to fall under the spell of the Ottoman Empire. WWI brought the Ottoman Empire to a dramatic end, with modern-day Montenegro forming part of a new country, Yugoslavia, in 1918. After WWII, Yugoslavia was governed by Josip Tito, a “benevolent dictator” whose authoritarian regime kept a lid on the ethnic tensions that existed within Yugoslavia. Tito was a socialist revolutionary and under his rule most businesses were run as workers’ co-operatives. Being a non-aligned country, Yugoslavia kept good relations with both West and East, and allowed its people more freedoms than their socialist counterparts in the USSR. When Yugoslavia began to break up during the 1990s, Montenegro remained loyal to Belgrade. Although there was no actual fighting on Montenegrin territory, the people suffered much economic hardship during that time. Eventually, in May 2006, Montenegro held a referendum and the people voted for independence from Serbia. In 2008, Montenegro applied for EU membership, and in 2012, having proved that it was serious about tackling corruption and organised crime, it opened accession negotiations with the EU. Did you know? •	Having no currency of its own, Montenegro has unilaterally adopted the Euro, the first non-EU fully recognised country to do so (Kosovo has also adopted the Euro unilaterally). •	Tito’s brand of socialism, often referred to as Titoism, pulled off the enviable feat of appealing to both communists and non-communists. •	Brad Pitt's first lead role was back in 1988, in Dark Side of the Sun, which was filmed by former Yugoslav director, Bozidar Nikolic, in Kotor, Montenegro. Majority Eastern Orthodox (72%, according to the 2011 census), with a Muslim minority (19%) and a Roman Catholic minority (3.5%). The remainder are either Atheist or “other”. As in any other foreign country, you should respect local laws and social customs when visiting Montenegro. This is an Eastern Orthodox country, so you should dress respectably for visiting churches and monasteries – legs and shoulders covered, for both men and women. Be cautious when talking about the war and the break-up of Yugoslavia - many people come from mixed families (which might include Eastern Orthodox Serbs, Roman Catholic Croats and Muslim Bosniaks), and “who was right” and “who was wrong” cannot be clearly defined. Also be aware that there is an Albanian minority (predominantly Muslim) in Montenegro, concentrated around Ulcinj. What various individuals think about the current situation in Kosovo will vary from person to person, so avoid entering into heated debate on this topic. Montenegrins are traditional and patriarchal, and the society has a deeply ingrained aversion to homosexuality. Gay visitors are advised to limit public displays of affection. In October 2013, 60 people were injured at the Gay Pride march in Podgorica, when anti-gay protestors threw stones at the demonstrators, and the police responded with tear-gas. Montenegrins enjoy drinking immensely but being able to hold one’s alcohol is a matter of pride, and public displays of drunken behaviour are considered degrading. Nudism is allowed on designated beaches and topless bathing for women is generally accepted on all beaches. The official language is Montenegrin, which is basically the same as Serbian and can be written in either Latin or Cyrillic script. The small Albanian minority (approx 5%) speak Albanian.","Montenegro has a Mediterranean climate on the coast, with alpine conditions in the mountains. The average summer coastal temperature is 27°C (81°F), and this is peak season (Jul-Aug), when the majority of visitors come here. Those who can’t bear the summer heat would do well to head inland for the mountains, where summer night time temperatures drop as low as 12°C (54°F). In shoulder season (May-Jun and Sep-Oct) you can expect sunny days on the shores of the Adriatic – the sea is warm enough to swim, but without the crowds, and average daytime temperatures are 20°C (69°F). This is the ideal time for outdoor activities such as hiking and cycling, though bear in mind that there will be sporadic rain in the mountains. In low season (Nov-Apr), many hotels and restaurants along the coast shut completely. The weather remains mild, with the average daytime winter temperature being 7°C (44°F). Inland, however, there is substantial snowfall in the mountains, with the average daytime winter temperature in Kolašin hovering around 0°C (32°F). In fact, Dec-Mar is peak season for inland towns such as Kolašin and Žabljak, which are popular ski resorts. In winter, medium weight clothing and heavy overcoat and boots if travelling in the mountains; in summer, lightweight clothing, swimwear and sun cream required on the coast, plus a jumper or jacket for colder nights in the mountains. Montenegro is bordered by Croatia to the north, Bosnia & Herzegovina to the northeast, Serbia to the east and Albania to the south. To the east lie the deep blue waters of the Adriatic Sea, and it is the 293km (183-mile) Montenegrin coastal strip that attracts the majority of visitors, with top destinations being the centuries-old seaside towns of Kotor and Budva. Here one of the most notably features is the stunning Bay of Kotor, a submerged river canyon resembling a fjord. Inland, the landscape is dominated by dramatic soaring alpine mountains rising over 2,000m (6,562ft), with the highest peak, Bobotov Kuk, reaching 2,523m (8,278ft). Here you’ll find dramatic glacial features, such as lakes and canyons, the most impressive being the River Tara Canyon, and dense forests. In the centre of the country, around Podgorica and Nikšić, lie fertile plains planted with crops and vineyards, while to the south, on the border with Albania, lies Lake Skadar, a vast wetland. Approximately 38% of land is given over to agriculture, but of this only 10% is cultivated, due to difficult terrain and poor soils."
europe,netherlands,"As flat as a local pannenkoek, the Netherlands is a land of colourful tulip fields and canals, sophisticated cities and some of the most striking coastline in Northern Europe. It punches well above its weight culturally, laying claim to the likes of Van Gogh, Rembrandt and Mondrian, amongst others. At the head of the state sits the country's constitutional monarchy, whose palaces dominate many of the larger cities, including The Hague and the capital city, Amsterdam. The latter, renowned for its step-gabled houses, ubiquitous bikes, seedy red light district and hazy coffeeshops, is bisected by a UNESCO-listed network of waterways, many of which are spanned by beautiful, latticed bridges. To the south lies Rotterdam, an industrial port city that has benefitted from a complete makeover in recent years, acquiring a slew of excellent museums and an unlikely affinity for hip-hop in the process. The butt of many a northern joke, the southern city of Maastricht lies in the much-maligned Limburg region. Despite the teasing, this is a city of delicate beauty, dotted with churches, bisected by a mighty river and home to what is almost certainly the best bookshop in the world, Selexyz Dominicanen. Back towards the coast, the Netherlands becomes more stereotypically Dutch, with vast colourful fields of tulips dotted with windmills and dairy farms producing the wheels of cheese for which the country is so famous. The low-lying Dutch countryside is scattered with a network of charming towns and villages such as Edam, Haarlem and Leiden, which have changed little over the centuries. Best of all though, are the sandy, North Sea beaches of Zeeland, which stretch for an almost unbroken 650km (403-miles). With more sunshine than any other part of the Netherlands, Zeeland is the Dutch riposte to the Caribbean – and with better cycling trails and museums, if not the hot weather, to boot. 41,543 sq km (16,039 sq miles). 17,020,000 (2016 World Bank). 488 per sq km. Amsterdam. Constitutional monarchy. King Willem-Alexander since 2013. Prime Minister Mark Rutte since 2010.","The Netherlands’ position at the threshold of the sea has historically been both a blessing and a curse. From its earliest settlement, inhabitants made efforts to keep their heads above water, as remains evident from the artificial mounds they constructed along the coast of Friesland. In modern times, vast public works projects have been undertaken, such as the Delta Project, built to protect the province of Zeeland after major floods in 1953. But the country has also taken advantage of its position and prospered from its overseas trade. Much of its productive farmland stands upon lands reclaimed from the seabed. Defenceless against the onslaught of foreign powers in its nascent stages, the Netherlands was ruled by a succession of overlords. The forts of Nijmegen and Maastricht are evidence of Roman domination at the start of Christian era. During feudal times, the Franks took over, then the Holy Roman Empire. In the Middle Ages some measure of independence emerged under the Dukes of Burgundy and the region began to prosper from a thriving cloth industry. Conflict erupted in the 16th century as Spain wielded its imperial power to suppress the rise of Protestantism in the northern provinces. Allying with the Catholic provinces to the south, Holland revolted against the Spanish and declared independence in 1588. A period of economic prosperity and cultural flowering ensued in the 17th century now recognised as Holland’s golden age. During this period, the country became a colonial power in Asia, Africa, the Caribbean and South America while the settlement of New Amsterdam in 1625 established a beachhead in North America. Concurrently, shipbuilding and related industries flourished. Wars with England over control of sea trade checked Holland’s ascendance, and France annexed the country in 1795. After the defeat of Napoleon at Waterloo, Prince William I of Orange became king and the 17 northern and southern provinces of the Netherlands reunited only to be severed again in 1830, as Belgium declared independence. The 19th century saw a shift to an industrialised society. The country managed to stay out of World War 1, but a few decades later succumbed to the onslaught of the Nazis, who systematically decimated Holland’s Jewish population. After World War 2, the Netherlands developed a progressive social welfare system and saw major migration from Morocco, Turkey and the former Dutch colonies of Surinam and the Antilles as a response to labour shortages. Did you know? • The World Happiness Report ranks the Netherlands the sixth happiest nation in the world. • The age of the Dutch Masters in the 17th century produced many painters including Rembrandt and Vermeer. • Famed Dutch actors include Rutger Hauer, Michael Huisman (Game of Thrones) and Famke Janssen. 24% Roman Catholic, 6.7% Dutch Reformed Church, 6% Calvinist, 4.9% Muslim, 42% other religions or none. The Dutch are a tolerant breed and there is little you can do or say to ruffle them (except perhaps to display your own intolerance of, say, ethnic minorities or alternative lifestyles). Their straightforwardness can sometimes strike foreigners as blunt, if not plain rude. Conversely, the Dutch will expect you to be direct as well: yes means yes, not 'maybe.' It is customary to shake hands when seeing someone you know or when being introduced to someone; women and men or women and women may kiss each other on alternating cheeks three times. You may be fashionably late for social gatherings but not for business meetings. Casual wear is generally acceptable, except for business functions or at smart restaurants, bars and clubs.

That said, mid-April to mid-October is probably the best time to go, although coastal resorts and big cities like Amsterdam do get busy during the summer holidays (July-August) - higher prices reflect the increased demand. To see the country’s famed bulb fields burst with colours, plan a trip to the Netherlands between mid-April and mid-May. You won't be disappointed. Summers are generally warm with changeable periods, but excessively hot weather is rare. Pack a light jacket or sweater even in mid-summer. Winters can be fairly cold with the possibility of some snow. Rainfall is ever a possibility, and rainwear is advisable year-round. The Netherlands shares borders to the south with Belgium and to the east with Germany, while the North Sea lies to the north and west. Large areas of The Netherlands have been reclaimed from the sea and consequently one-fifth of the country lies below sea level. The country is flat and level and is criss-crossed by rivers and canals. Areas reclaimed from the sea, known as polders, are extremely fertile. The landscape is broken by the forest of Arnhem, the bulb fields in the west, the lakes of the central and northern areas, and coastal dunes that are among the most impressive in Europe."
europe,north-macedonia,"The Republic of North Macedonia, formerly known as the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (sometimes abbreviated as FYROM and FYR Macedonia), is underrated and under-explored. A mountainous nation at the heart of the Balkans, it’s sprinkled with picturesque valleys and shimmering lakes, offering outdoor appeal in spades. Yet that isn't its sole selling point – North Macedonia (FYR Macedonia) also has a bustling capital, a rich Hellenic heritage and an up-and-coming wine industry that appears on the cusp of international recognition. For most visitors, the adventure begins in the capital Skopje. The cityscape is an incongruous jumble of buildings and gigantic neoclassical statuary. Monolithic socialist apartment blocks sit beside grandiloquent monuments, controversially added during an ambitious government scheme dubbed Skopje 2014. Old Ottoman and Byzantine edifices hark back to the nation's pre-communist history, while buzzing bars and clubs project its forward-looking aspirations. Rural North Macedonia (FYR Macedonia) is far easier of the eye. Blessed with an extraordinary diversity of landscapes, the countryside is also home to serene lakeside towns such as Ohrid, which offers glorious relief from the sizzling Balkan summer. Visitors can while away lazy days on the dreamy lake’s edge, visit the region’s handsome, time-warp churches and enjoy languid evenings quaffing wine produced in the surrounding hills. From Ohrid push on into the endless green pastures of the Šar Planina mountain range, where the tranquil glacier lakes mirror the surrounding peaks, or try trekking the mountainous Pelister National Park, a dead ringer for the Swiss Alps. Outdoor enthusiasts heading to the remote hinterlands are more likely to see wild goats than deluxe resorts, but the country’s rustic inns are welcoming and affordable. During winter, there are many opportunities for skiing and snowboarding, particularly in the Mavrovo region. Like most countries in the region, North Macedonia (FYR Macedonia) has had its fair share of political and economic problems over the years. But shrug aside the stigma of the past and you’ll find a different Europe – one that’s fresh, crowd-free and, for the time being, incredibly affordable. 25,713 sq km (9,927.8 sq miles). 2,081,012 (UN estimate 2016). 81.5 per sq km.

Prime Minister Talat Xhaferi since January 2024.","An ancient, strategically important and much-contested territory, the historical region known as Macedonia was variously controlled by the Greeks, Romans, Bulgarians, Byzantines, Serbs and the marauding Ottoman Turks, who conquered the area in 1371, and kept it until the beginning of the 20th century. Then, as Turkish power declined, Macedonia once again became a bone of contention between its various neighbours and their respective superpower allies. In 1912 and 1913, the Balkan Wars drove the Turks out of the area, and the territory was carved up between Serbia and Greece, with Bulgaria retaining a small part. Vardar Macedonia became part of the new 'Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes' in 1918, becoming Yugoslavia from 1929. However, this caused much anti-Serbian resentment locally. In 1945, the area became a constituent republic of the new communist Yugoslav federation, which the Serbs opposed. Thereafter a new 'Macedonian' nation was created, but this was never accepted as legitimate by any of the republic's neighbours. In 1990, following the collapse of communism in Yugoslavia (now Serbia and Montenegro), Macedonia held its first multi-party elections. North Macedonia’s (FYR Macedonia’s) quest for international recognition ran up against objections from Greece, which felt that Skopje's use of the title 'Macedonia' implies a territorial claim against Aegean Macedonia in Greece, given that it corresponds with the northern Greek province of the same name. The Greeks agreed to a compromise name, 'The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia', under which it joined the United Nations in 1993. In 1997, simmering ethnic tensions between the majority Slavic population and the country's Albanian minority – who make up roughly 20% of the population – turned violent. The conflict was closely related to that in the Yugoslav province of Kosovo to the north. The situation deteriorated until, in 1998, the flight of thousands of refugees from Kosovo persuaded the Macedonian government to close the border. The crisis passed but erupted again in 2001 after a series of clashes between Macedonian security forces and ethnic Albanian guerrillas. Urgent international diplomacy brought about the Ohrid Agreement that same year guaranteeing political and cultural rights for the Albanian population. While the Greek government called its northern neighbour by its interim name 'The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia’ for over two decades, some 140 countries, including the US and China, referred to it as 'The Republic of Macedonia'. Negotiations with Greece to resolve the name issue continued until June 2018, when Greece and Macedonia struck a deal on the name change. On 25 January 2019, the Greek parliament ratified an accord allowing the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia to officially change it’s name to the Republic of North Macedonia, or North Macedonia for short). Did you know? •	Mother Teresa was born in North Macedonia’s capital, Skopje. •	Macedonia was the first country in the world to provide wireless broadband coverage to virtually all of its population. •	The French mixed fruit salad, macédoine, was so-named because of Macedonia’s ethnic diversity. 67% of the population are Eastern Orthodox Macedonians and around 23% are Muslim Albanians. There are also Muslim Turks and Serbian Orthodox minorities. As elsewhere in the former Yugoslav federation, local politics are now strongly divided along national religious lines. Handshaking is the common practice on introduction. Local business protocol is fairly informal, but things go very slowly or not at all owing to the local bureaucracy and the more recent general socio-economic collapse in North Macedonia (FYR Macedonia).

English, French and German are widely spoken.","As a landlocked country, North Macedonia (FYR Macedonia) has a pronounced continental climate, with very cold winters and hot summers. Mediumweight clothing and very warm overcoats in winter; lightweight clothing and raincoats required for the summer. Roughly rectangular in shape, and on the strategic Vardar Valley north-south communications route, North Macedonia (FYR Macedonia) is landlocked, bordering Serbia to the north, Albania to the west, Greece to the south and Bulgaria to the east."
europe,united-kingdom,"Northern Ireland distils the best of Britain into a bite-sized bundle: its plunging glens and pristine lochs are as gorgeous as any in Scotland; its quaint countryside villages as olde-worlde as anything in rural Wales; and Belfast borrows its Victorian pomp from London. Of course, it’s irrefutably Irish too, and few visitors get further than ordering a pint of Guinness before encountering the wit and loquacious charm of its inhabitants. This hasn’t always been the case. For decades it was best avoided due to the riots and bombings of The Troubles, which erupted between Unionists and Republicans in the late 1960s. But since 1998’s Good Friday Agreement, which calmed the fighting and quelled the geopolitical disorder, tourists are starting to appreciate what they’ve missed for so long. Covering little more than a sixth of the Irish landmass, Northern Ireland has plenty to pique attention: from majestic mountains and bracing coastline to ancient monasteries and toe-tapping live music joints. As locals will proudly tell you, Game of Thrones was filmed across the country, and coaches now make their way to The Mourne Mountains (Vaes Dothrak), The Haunted Forest (Tollymore Forest Park) and Beric Dondarrion’s hideout (Pollnagollum Cave) for picture opportunities. Belfast remains the showpiece. Its patched history offset by unbridled nightlife, major cultural attractions (not least the incredible Titanic Belfast museum) and an invigorating restaurant scene. Further west, highbrow arts and goodtime festivals thrive in absorbing Derry/Londonderry, while the tiny cathedral city of Armagh still stands as the ecclesiastical capital of all Ireland. From the rugged hills of County Armagh and the quiet loughs of County Down to the granite bulk of the Mountains of Mourne, its al fresco treats are many, but one indoor pursuit prevails: drinking, which is as important here as it is south of the border. From countryside boozers to time-burnished city saloons, you’re never far from a pub here. Northern Ireland’s compact size stands as a selling point.

In the 17th century, the so-called Ulster Plantations saw Scottish Presbyterian settlers come to the region although English monarchs before and after laid claim to it, often ruthlessly. The 1920 Partition of Ireland gave home rule to its six north-eastern counties and created the Irish Free State (now the sovereign Republic of Ireland) ruled from Dublin. This remains the root cause for the ethno-nationalist violence that overshadowed Northern Ireland for much of the 20th century. The most strife-ridden period, from 1968 to 1998, is known as the Troubles. The 1970s brought civil disorder, internment, troops on the streets and bombing campaigns that spread throughout the United Kingdom before peace negotiations began in the mid-1990s. The Good Friday Agreement (officially the Belfast Agreement) was signed on 10 April 1998 and the Northern Ireland Assembly was set up in 1998. Representatives of all parties took part and, although the Assembly was largely suspended from 2000 to 2007, a historic meeting between Gerry Adams of the republican Sinn Féin and ardent nationalist Ian Paisley of the Democratic Unionist Party took place in 2007 as the Assembly was restored. Sadly, while life goes on relatively peacefully, it would be false to claim the scars of the Troubles have completely healed. Social tensions have raised their heads periodically since the restoration of the Assembly, notably in December 2012 and early 2013, when a decision to limit the number of days the Union Flag flew outside Belfast City Hall was met with violent demonstrations. The Northern Ireland Assembly was again suspended in 2017 and remains so after policy disagreements and the resignation of Martin McGuinness. Did you know? Predominantly Christian (Church of Ireland, Roman Catholic, Presbyterian, Methodist), sizeable Muslim, Sikh, Jewish and Hindu minorities. Around 15% of the population have no (or unstated) religion. Due to the still-sensitive political situation in Northern Ireland, visitors should avoid expressing dogmatic opinions on political or religious topics. At the same time, it’s important not to overplay the risks involved with visiting the country, which for tourists are very slim. Handshaking is customary when introduced to someone for the first time. Likewise, ‘normal’ social courtesies should be observed when visiting someone's home and a small present such as flowers or chocolates will always be appreciated. It is standard practice to wait until everyone has been served before eating. In general terms, the Irish people are renowned for their congeniality, good humour and easy-going nature, and the pub remains perhaps the ideal setting in which to get a true feel for the pulse of the nation. Smoking is banned in all public enclosed spaces, including pubs, bars and restaurants. English. The Irish language (Gaelic) is spoken by a minority.","In general, the weather is similar to the rest of the UK, but Northern Ireland tends to have less sunshine and more rain. The hilly nature of the terrain tends to attract clouds, and westerly winds are common in some areas. Extremes of temperature are rare but conditions can be changeable. In broad terms, however, it has an equable climate – the effects of the Atlantic Gulf Stream have a moderating influence, leading to mild winters and relatively cool summers. The mean annual temperature in Northern Ireland at low-lying altitude is around 9°C. The height of summer draws the largest numbers of tourists, particularly to headline attractions such as Giant’s Causeway, so it can be advisable to come in spring or autumn to make the most of the reduction in visitors. Similar to the rest of the UK, according to season. Waterproofs are advisable throughout the year. If you find yourself lacking any vital wardrobe items on arrival – formal or informal – all key towns and cities are well stocked with clothing outlets, with the larger cities particularly good in terms of picking up high quality outdoor equipment. Camping essentials are also straightforward to come by. Northern Ireland contains some beautiful scenery, from the rugged coastline in the north and northeast to the gentle fruit-growing regions of Armagh. To the west are the Sperrin Mountains and the lakelands of Fermanagh, where the winding River Erne provides excellent fishing. The high moorland plateau of Antrim in the east gives way to the glens further south and to the Drumlin country of County Down; further south still, the Mountains of Mourne stretch down to the sea. The country comprises six historic counties: County Antrim, County Armagh, County Down, County Fermanagh, County Derry/Londonderry and County Tyrone. Northern Ireland is still sometimes spoken about as Ulster, despite the fact that it includes only six of the nine counties that comprised the historic Irish province (the other three are across the border in the Irish Republic). Belfast sits in the east of the country, at the point where the River Lagan reaches the sea. This strategic location, being easily accessible from various parts of the UK mainland, was integral to its heritage as a major shipbuilding destination. The hills around the city, which some claim resemble a sleeping giant, are said to be the inspiration for Jonathan Swift’s classic novel Gulliver’s Travels."
europe,norway,"From precipitous glaciers to steep-sided gorges and crystalline fjords, Norway’s natural beauty is impossible to overstate. The unspoilt wilderness of the Arctic north is one of the few places where the sun shines at midnight during the summer and where the magnificent Northern Lights brighten the skies during the long winter nights. Further to the south, the picturesque cities of Oslo, Trondheim and Bergen are brim-full of buildings showing off Scandinavia’s age-old flair for design in cosmopolitan surroundings. Oslo is the present-day capital and financial centre, while the country’s second city, Bergen, is a picturesque former Hanseatic trading port and gateway to the fjords of Norway. Stavanger is the focal point of the Norwegian oil industry and former capital, Trondheim, is a long-established centre of Christian pilgrimage, and more recently, technical research. Though the weather can be a tad grim in Bergen, the UNESCO-listed waterfront adds a flash of colour with its wooden warehouses and shimmering harbour. Oslo’s waterfront is no less beautiful and has an ice-white Opera House that could give Sydney’s version a run for its money. Stunning though the cities are, the real wonders of Norway are to be found outdoors. In the far north, the glacier-covered sub-polar peninsular of Svalbard is one of the few areas where polar bears can be seen in the wild and Norway’s miles of Arctic tundra double up as a destination for skiing and spotting the Northern Lights. Elsewhere, a ferry trip along Geirangerfjord must rank among the world’s prettiest voyages with pine-topped cliffs giving way to icy green water, regularly topped up by the waterfalls that cascade down the fissured sides of the ravine. Indeed, you’d be hard pushed to find a part of Norway’s northern fjord area that isn’t strikingly beautiful, with snow-capped peaks and looming forests almost everywhere you look. 385,186 sq km (148,721 sq miles). 5,271,958 (UN estimate 2016). 14.3 per sq km. Oslo. Constitutional monarchy. King Harald V since 1991. Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre since 2021.","From Norse warriors to Vidkun Quisling, Norway’s history boasts enough twists and turns to fill a Viking epic. Early Norse civilisation bore cultural fruit in the shape of Viking epics and the ferocity of Viking warriors is still remembered today. The age of the Vikings came to an end with the advent of Christianity and the death of King Harald Hardrada in the battle of Stamford Bridge in 1066 but their legacy lives on, with the Viking period remaining one of the best-known in Norwegian history. The years up to 1905 saw Norway lose its sovereignty, first to Denmark and then to Sweden, when it was handed to Stockholm in 1814 by the Danes who were forced to concede it as a result of being on the losing side in the Napoleonic Wars. After much wrangling, Norway finally gained independence in 1905 following a referendum. Its newly won autonomy wasn’t to last and the Germans invaded in 1940, installing a puppet government led by Vidkun Quisling whose name was to become a by-word for treachery. Norway regained its independence as a constitutional monarchy after the Nazis were defeated in 1945. One of the most divisive issues in contemporary Norwegian politics has been the country's relationship with the rest of Europe. Norwegians are fiercely protective of their independence and concerns about the effect of European Union membership on the country’s major industries have meant that the electorate has consistently voted to remain outside the EU. However, Norway did join the European Free Trade Area (EFTA), which represents most of the European nations, which are not members of the EU.   Further afield, the Norwegians have established a considerable reputation for handling delicate conflict negotiations, particularly in hosting and mediating the negotiations leading up to the 1994 Israeli-Palestinian peace accord – one of the major foreign policy coups of recent times. Usually a peaceful and stable country, July 2011 saw twin attacks on the government quarter in Oslo and the Labour Party youth summer camp at Utøya Island, resulting in 77 deaths – Norway’s largest loss of life in a single incident since World War 2. Did you know? • The sperm whale is the largest predator in Norwegian waters and the brown bear the largest on land. • In 2015 Norway’s King Harald V became the world’s first reigning monarch to set foot on Antarctica when he visited Queen Maud Land, a Norwegian dependency. • The Hardangerjøkulen glacier appears as the ice planet Hoth in the film Star Wars Episode V – The Empire Strikes Back. According to 2016 figures, just under 78% of Norwegians identify themselves as Christian. 71.5% of Norwegians belong to the Church of Norway – an Evangelical-Lutheran denomination. Another 6% belong to other Christian denominations such as Catholicism. Of the non-Christian religions the largest group are Muslims, followed by Buddhists, Hindus, Sikhs, Baha’i and Jews, all of which account for 3.5% of the population. 16% of Norwegians identify themselves as having no religious affiliation at all. Normal courtesies should be observed and follow similar lines to those of other European countries, with a few regional exceptions, for example, guests refraining from drinking until the host has toasted their health. Hosts and hostesses often expect an invited guest to offer small gifts on arrival for a meal. Punctuality is expected if invited out for dinner. Lunch, generally a light open sandwich snack known as a matpakke, takes place between 11.30am and 12pm, while dinner is very early - around 5pm. Norwegian (Bokmål and Nynorsk)is the official language but Northern Sami, Lule Sami, Kven and Southern Sami are also recognised. English is widely spoken throughout Norway as are Swedish and Danish.","The best time to visit is between mid May and mid August, unless you're coming to ski, in which case the best time is December to Easter. Hikers and those in search of outdoor pursuits including wildlife watching should aim to visit in the summer months when the warmer weather makes getting out and about in the Norwegian countryside a real pleasure. Better still, the summer is low season, which means accommodation and transport deals aplenty. European according to the season. Light to medium-weights are worn in summer. Warmer clothing, gloves and hats are necessary during the winter. Waterproofing is advisable throughout the year. Norway is bordered to the north by the Arctic Ocean, to the east by Finland, the Russian Federation and Sweden, to the south by the Skagerrak (which separates it from Denmark) and to the west by the North Sea. The coastline is over 25,000km (15,534 miles) long, its most outstanding feature being the numerous fjords. Most of them are from 80km to 160km (50 to 100 miles) long, and are usually flanked by towering mountains. Much of northern Norway lies beyond the Arctic Circle and consequently, mostly takes the form of rugged tundras. The south is covered with pine and larch forests, and dotted with lakes, rivers and mountains."
europe,poland,"Underrated but increasingly popular, Poland offers a huge amount for travellers of all stripes – from the stunning old towns of Krakow, Zamość, Gdańsk and Wroclaw to the wilderness of the Białowieża National Park with its ubiquitous buffalos and epic vistas. Home to Europe’s most infamous ghetto, Warsaw was almost totally destroyed during WWII, but the Polish capital is modernising fast. Today the city blends Soviet architecture and contemporary styles, with a painstakingly recreated old town and an upbeat, progressive population. Perhaps the country's biggest draw, though, is Krakow. The country's former royal capital is a wonderfully preserved architectural marvel that has somehow managed to survive Poland’s many wars. Even the Nazis thought it was too beautiful to bomb. Jam-packed with churches, monasteries and abbeys in Gothic and Renaissance styles, the city became the first ever UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1978 (an honour it shared with Quito, Ecuador). Beyond Krakow are numerous signs of Poland’s proud cultural heritage: Łódź and its famous film school, from which Roman Polański and Krzysztof Kieślowski graduated; Toruń, the hometown of astronomer Nicholas Copernicus; and Warsaw, which lays claim to Marie Curie and Frederick Chopin. The country's biggest port and northern boomtown, Gdańsk, is best known as the birthplace of Lech Wałęsa's Solidarity movement, which led the country into democracy in 1989. Poland's scenic beauty is as varied as it is extraordinary. The Baltic coast is pretty, while Słowiński National Park is all ethereal forests, bogs and sand dunes. The Great Masurian Lakes in the northeast are popular for kayakers, with hundreds of pristine lakes broken up by dense forest. The Krakow-Wielun Upland with its limestone caves and medieval castles is another highlight, while the Carpathian Mountains in the far south are unremittingly beautiful. And the food? Polish cuisine is hearty and filling, rich in meat and game. Thick soups such as Zurek are delicious, as are pierogi, or Polish dumplings. And as for the Polish vodka, one of the finest types in the world, what better way to wash all that rich food down? 312,685 sq km (120,728 sq miles). 38,593,161 (UN estimate 2016). 123.3 per sq km. Warsaw. Republic. President Andrzej Duda since 2015. Prime Minister Donald Tusk since 2023.","The history of Poland begins in the Early Middle Ages with the migration of Slavs into the area, which by the 10th century had established a permanent settlement and founded the nascent Polish state. At its peak, it was one of the large nations in Europe, prospering under a commonwealth with Lithuania, but by the 18th century its territory had been reduced to little more than a buffer state between the three kingdoms of Austria, Prussia and Russia. Between 1772 and 1795, the country was carved up amongst the three countries and did not gain independence again until the end of WWI in 1918. In 1926, a military regime under Józef Piłsudski ousted the civilian administration and governed Poland until the country was once again dismembered by its powerful neighbours, Germany and the Soviet Union, under the terms of their so-called Anti-Aggression Pact of 1939. Commitments by the UK to defend Polish sovereignty were ignored when Germany invaded Poland in September 1939, starting World War II. In 1941, the Germans drove the Soviet army out of Poland and were themselves ejected four years later. At the end of World War II, the Soviet-backed Polish Workers' Party formed a coalition government under Władysław Gomułka, until he was dismissed in 1948. In the same year, the Polish Workers' Party merged with the Polish Socialist Party to form the Polish United Workers' Party (PZPR). In 1956, Gomułka returned to power amidst growing unrest to implement a plan of gradual liberalisation of society and the economy. After disturbances in the industrial ports of Gdańsk, Gdynia and Szczecin in 1970, Gomułka was replaced as first secretary of the party by Edward Gierek. In 1981, with the backing of Moscow, the former army chief of staff, General Wojciech Jaruzelski, replaced Kania and imposed martial law in response to the Solidarity labour movement, which was banned. The early 1980s saw a tense standoff between the state and the unions, which did not ease until the Gorbachev era. In 1989, following the virtual collapse of the Polish economy and the falling of the Berlin Wall, the PZPR government opened genuine negotiations with Solidarity, which was legalised, paving the way for semi-free elections. In 1990, Solidarity's Wałesa became the first popularly elected president of Poland. Poland joined NATO in 1997 and the European Union in 2004. Did you know? • Poland was not a sovereign state from 1795 to 1918, but desire for a Polish nation burned fiercely unceasingly through the period. • The Polish constitution was the first in Europe and the second in the world, after India. • Roughly one third of Poles are thought to live abroad. More than 95% identify as Roman Catholic; Polish Autocephalous Orthodox (so-called Old Believers), Russian and Greek Orthodox, Protestants and Jews make up the other 5%. Poles are friendly, industrious people and foreigners are usually made very welcome. There are vast contrasts between urban and rural life and the Polish peasantry is very religious and conservative, maintaining a traditional lifestyle. Roman Catholicism plays an important role in daily life and criticism or jokes about religion are not appreciated, despite the general good humour of the people. Shaking hands is the normal form of greeting; an older man will often kiss a woman’s hand. Normal courtesies are observed when visiting private homes, and it is customary to bring flowers, preferably in odd numbers. Fairly conservative casual wear is the most suitable attire, but dress should be formal when specified for entertaining in the evening or in a smart restaurant. Smoking is banned in public places, including railway stations, restaurants and bars. Polish is the official language. There are a few small German-speaking communities primarily in the southwest.

Snow covers the mountainous area in the south of Poland (mid-December to April). Rain falls throughout the year. The most pleasant times to visit Poland are late spring and early summer (May-June) and late summer and early autumn (September-October), when it's still warm and the crowds of tourists have either not yet arrived or already gone home. The added advantages of these shoulder seasons is that you’ll hit the asparagus season in spring and enjoy the best hiking conditions in early autumn. Light- to mediumweights are worn during warmer months. Medium- to heavyweight clothing is needed during winter. Rainwear is advisable all year. You might also want to bring good walking shoes/hiking boots for urban/rural exploration. In general Poles dress casually, but where there is an event on, it’s to the nines. If you expect to attend a wedding or red-letter party, bring something dressy. Poland shares borders with Belarus, Ukraine, Lithuania and the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad to the east and northeast; Czech Republic and Slovakia to the south; and Germany to the west. To the north lies the Baltic Sea. The Baltic coast provides almost 525km (325 miles) of sandy beaches, bays and steep cliffs; between Gdańsk, and the port city of Szczecin to the west there are many seaside towns offering unpolluted water and some fine beaches, with sunbeds and umbrellas available for hire. These sand and gravel deposits also form the shifting dunes of Słowiński National Park, the sand bars of Hel and the Vistula Lagoon. Northern Poland is dominated by lakes, islands and wooded hills joined by many rivers and canals. The Masurian Lake District to the northeast is a patchwork of lakes and forests with Lake Hańcza, the deepest lake in Poland, located here. The longest river, the 1,090km (675 mile) Vistula, or Wisła, rises in the Tatra mountains and empties into the Baltic, cutting a wide valley between the capital, Warsaw in the heart of the country, to Gdańsk on the coast. The rest of the country rises slowly to the Sudety mountains, which run along the border with the Czech Republic, and the Tatra Mountains, which separate Poland from Slovakia. To the west, the River Oder, with Szczecin at its mouth, forms the northwest border with Germany. Poland counts almost two dozen national parks, covering an area of 3,200 sq km (1,235 sq miles), and including the oldest, Białowieża National Park, east of Warsaw on the border with Belarus, and one of the largest, Bieszczady National Park, part of the Carpathian mountain range. These parks are home to European bison (the largest mammal in Europe), brown bears, lynx, wolves and even some wild horses. And Białowieża contains a fragment of the forest that once covered Europe prehistoric times, with some oaks dating back half a millennium. Polish forests are largely pine though, accounting for two-thirds of the total."
europe,portugal,"Like the Atlantic Ocean that laps upon its shores, Portugal throws up one or two surprises. A rich and varied land of vibrant cities and traditional villages, visitors are astounded by the country’s stunning beaches, rolling countryside and cornucopia of UNESCO World Heritage Sites, which range from prehistoric drawings at Foz Coa to the 15th-century port of Angra do Heroísmo. The country’s lively capital, Lisbon, and its vibrant northern sibling, Porto, are a joy to discover. They are cities where trams rattle up and down hills and along promenades, trundling past narrow side streets and majestic plazas, bohemian cafés and pumping nightclubs, eye-catching boutiques and restaurants both hip and homespun. It’s not all about Lisbon and Porto, though. Sintra plays host to the stunning National Palace, a Moorish castle and the dramatic villa of Quinta da Regaleira, while the cities of Coimbra, Guimarães, Braga and Évora all boast beautifully preserved medieval quarters. Unusually, the latter is home to a chapel made exclusively of human bones, which is a tad creepy. Travellers in search of a rural respite can wander around ancient vineyards, trek to stone villages perched in the mountains and take full advantage of the country’s warm and sunny weather on the magnificent southern shoreline. Drop in on sleepy sulphur spas and hop around the Pousadas – a collection of exquisite convents and monasteries, which have been lovingly converted into off-beat accommodation. Imposing cliffs and secluded beaches line the Portuguese coast, a dazzling stage for all manner of outdoor adventure. Visitors can ride horses, surf waves, paddle rivers, dive shipwrecks, hike hills and explore Moorish castles and Roman ruins between rounds of golf. Madeira and Berlenga Islands beckon off shore, while the elusive remains of Atlantis await discovery in the Azores Archipelago. Those seeking a more unique slice of Portuguese culture can discover the melancholic music of fado (Portugal's answer to the blues), study the captivating detail of Manueline architecture, get involved in a traditional festival or quaff port wine along the meandering Douro river. 92,345 sq km (35,655 sq miles). 10,304,434 (UN estimate 2016). 117.2 per sq km. Lisbon. Republic. President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa since 2016. Prime Minister Luís Montenegro since 2024.","Portugal has a rich and varied history and its territory has been fought over, invaded and settled ever since prehistoric times. Romans, Visigoths and the Germanic tribes followed the Celts, Phoenicians and Carthiginians before the Moors conquered the Iberian peninsula in AD 711. For centuries afterwards the region was part of Muslim Spain until the Christian Reconquista that saw Portuguese independence declared in 1139 by King Afonso I. Along with the British, Dutch, French and Spanish, Portugal's historic influence has due to its strong seafaring capabilities. Indeed, it was the first Western nation to establish a global empire. Its explorers led the Age of Discovery with Bartolomeu Dias reaching the Cape of Good Hope in 1488, Vasco da Gama founding a sea route to India in 1497 and Pedro Álvares Cabral discovering Brazil in 1500. Its ascendancy wasn't to last though. After the destruction of its capital Lisbon in the 1755 earthquake, the disastrous Battle of Alcácer Quibir in Morocco in 1578 saw the childless King Sebastian I killed and Portugal united with Spain. In the decades following Portugal lost significant portions of its overseas empire, principally to Dutch companies, although it fought and won the Restoration War with Spain, which ended in 1688. In 1807 it was occupied by Napoleon and as it turned to its British allies to fight the invasion the court of Queen Maria I transferred to Brazil where it remained until 1821. A year later Brazil proclaimed its independence. From the second half of the 19th century until the 1980s more then 2.6 million Portuguese emigrated – more than any Western European country other than Ireland – mostly for economic reasons. Portugal's monarchy ended after the 1910 revolution and the rest of the 20th century was defined by a series of uprising, coups and revolutions until the peaceful 1974 Carnation Revolution – so-called because barely a shot was fired and when the people took to the streets to celebrate flowers were put in the muzzles of the soldiers' guns. To this day 25 April is a national holiday known as Freedom Day. When Portugal handed over the territory of Macau to the China in 1999 it marked the end of Europe's longest colonial empire. Did you know? • In 2001 Portugal became the first country in the world to decriminalise the usage of all common drugs, although their sale and distribution remains illegal. • Footballer Cristiano Ronald does not have any tattoos as it would prevent him from giving blood, which he does several times a year. • The distinctive Manueline architecture of the early 16th century is characterised by tributes to the great discoveries of da Gama and Cabral. Roman Catholics make up around 85% of the population, but only about 20% of these regularly attend mass and take the sacraments. The remaining 15% is a mixture of Agnostic, Anglican, Atheist, Jewish, Muslim and Protestant communities, together with other religions that have been brought in through immigration over the years. Portugal is a fascinating mix of culture and folklore, depending on what part of the country you are visiting. Traditional ranchos folclóricos folklore, which is often illustrated with dance and song, tends to dominate the smaller towns and villages, with art and drama bigger in the larger towns and cities. The Portuguese are warm, hospitable people who revel in exhibitions, films, crafts, concerts, plays, café culture and also shopping malls (to combat the summer heat!). The summer festival season is a particularly pleasant experience, with football and bullfighting also enjoyed, along with the traditional religious activities that cater for the majority Catholic population. Casual wear is widely acceptable, but you shouldn’t wear beach clothing in towns. Smoking has been prohibited in public indoor spaces since 2008 and the ban includes cinemas, theatres, buses and most restaurants. European Portuguese is spoken in Portugal with different dialects throughout the country. Açoriano, Alentejano, Algarvio, Baixo-Beirão, Beirão, Estremenho and Madeirense are spoken in the central regions and south, with Alto-Minhoto, Nortenho and Transmontano in the northern parts. Barranquenho, Minderico and Mirandese are either spoken rarely or in a concentrated area like Barrancos and Miranda do Douro. Brazilian Portuguese and languages native to Cape Verde, Ukraine, Angola, Guinea, the UK and Romania are also spoken widely due to the larger immigration of people from these particular places, along with other mostly European countries. Spanish can be understood and spoken in those areas nearer the Portuguese border. Beer = Cerveja Closed = Fechado / Fechada Danger = Perigo Do you speak English? = Você fala inglês?

It can become rainy and windy during autumn and winter, but spring and summer see temperatures soar to as high as 40°C (104°F) around the interior and 35°C (95°F) in the north. The northwest has mild winters with high levels of rainfall, and fairly short summers. The northeast experiences longer winters and hot summers. In the south, summers (May to October) are warm with very little rain except in early spring and autumn. Snow will fall in the north, but melts quickly. Light- to mediumweights and rainwear are advised (Portugal has one of the highest rainfalls in Europe). In summer, wear very light fabrics, preferably linen, as temperatures can soar and prove very uncomfortable if you have packed wrongly. Should you travel in spring or autumn, pack a combination of both. Portugal juts out into the Atlantic in the far southwest of Europe otherwise known as the Iberian Peninsula. The only country it shares a border with is neighbouring Spain to the north and the east, with the Atlantic Ocean hugging its 800km (500-mile) coastline to the south and west. The country also comprises the Portuguese islands of the Azores and Madeira. The Azores lie around 1,100km (700 miles) west of Lisbon, while Madeira sits just north of the Canary Islands to the west of Morocco. Outside the large urban areas, the countryside is a great deal more rural and sparse than in many other European countries. Portugal is crossed by several rivers which have their origin in Spain. These flow from east to west out into the Atlantic or north to south, the main rivers being the Minho and Douro in the north, and the Tagus and Guadiana in the south. Portugal possesses a high plain of varying height intersected by deep valleys. The north of the country is rugged, mountainous and dotted with vineyards. The high northern point of the Serra da Estrela proves a popular area for skiing, while Serra de São Mamede further south on the Spanish border is a hiking favourite. After the stunning slopes of the central regions, the vast plains of the Alentejo region stretch south of Lisbon, with a range of mountains dividing the Alentejo from the Algarve, whose wide sandy beaches and attractive bays run along the south coast. Approximately half the country is used for agriculture. The capital, Lisbon, sits about two-thirds down the west coast. Porto is also situated on the coast in the northwest of the country. Smaller Faro nestles on the southern end of the country, its airport a busy hub for Algarve sunseekers and swathes of golfers looking for year-round sun. Braga, Coimbra and Setubal are also near the coast and rivers."
europe,romania,"Romania has a rich cultural and natural diversity. Its dramatic mountain scenery includes the densely forested Carpathian Mountains, picturesque valleys and miles of fine white sandy beaches on the Black Sea Coast. The first post of call for most travellers is the bustling capital, Bucharest, which was once known as ‘Little Paris’ due to its sophisticated charm. Crammed with grand architecture, fascinating museums and traditional restaurants, it’s well worth a few days exploration. So too are the resorts along the Black Sea Coast, which surprise many with their stunning sandy beaches and ocean panoramas. Ultimately, though, Romania remains defined by its small, rural communities, many of which still depend on ancient agricultural practices. From the isolated villages clinging to the Carpathian Mountains to the Saxon towns of Transylvania, a tour of Romania’s backcountry will uncover traditional ways of life and a treasure chest of cultural gems. It is, of course, practically illegal to talk about Transylvania without mentioning the legend of Dracula. The Romanians are all too well aware of the interest in Bram Stoker’s fictional vampire and the castle at Bran (supposedly the spot that inspired Stoker’s story) has been transformed into one of the country’s top tourist attractions. Elsewhere the forests covering the Carpathian Mountains shelter some of Europe's last remaining brown bears, wolves and lynxes, while racoon dogs and rare muskrats gather around the rivers. While Romania offers travellers the chance to immerse themselves in a defiantly traditional way of life, that isn’t to say the locals don’t appreciate their creature comforts. The natural spas scattered across the country purport to cure everything from rheumatism to heart disease, and make a luxurious finale to any Romanian adventure. 238,391 sq km (92,043 sq miles). 19,372,734 (UN estimate 2016). 90.9 per sq km. Bucharest. Republic. President Klaus Iohannis since 2014. Prime Minister Marcel Ciolacu since June 2023.","The region of Romania has spent much of its history being shunted to and fro between various foreign powers. The Romans, Goths, Huns, Bulgars and Slavs all laid claim to the area before it was annexed by the Turkish Ottomans in the 15th century. It wasn’t until 1878 that Romania was recognised by the rest of Europe as an independent state. It joined the Allied cause in WWI, but was occupied by the Germans in 1940 and placed in the hands of General Ion Antonescu, who joined the Nazis against the Soviet Union. In 1944, with Soviet forces about to occupy the country, Antonescu was overthrown and replaced by a coalition of communists, liberals and social democrats. The communists established their political hegemony within the government and in 1947 the monarchy was deposed and the Romanian People's Republic declared. Nicolae Ceausescu assumed the post of First Secretary of the Romanian Communist Party in 1965 and under his rule the regime became increasingly oppressive. Ceausescu destroyed much of the beautiful historic centre of Bucharest, replacing it with bland concrete apartment blocks and a sprawling palace – the House of the Republic. He held power until the dramatic, bloody and largely unpredicted revolution during Christmas 1989. This was a turning point in Romanian history. After several days of violent protests and fighting, during which around 1,000 people were killed, the president and his wife were captured, quickly tried and executed. The new government, under the provisional leadership of Ion Iliescu (the former Communist Central Committee Secretary) began the slow and painful process of preparing Romania for peaceful multi-party elections. Today, Romania is a fully-fledged and cohesive democratic state. Although regular changes of government have held back the country’s development and economic progress has been patchy, the country is now a member of both NATO and the European Union and in 2008 it hosted its first NATO summit. Political and economic unrest in 2012 threatened a crisis, but the corner has been turned and the country is experiencing much more positive growth than many of Europe’s leading nations. Did you know? •	Romania celebrates Great Union Day on 1 December to mark its joining with Transylvania. •	In 1986 Steaua Bucharest became the first Eastern European team to win football’s European Cup. •	The Dacia car factory in Mioveni is Europe’s fifth largest, producing more than 500,000 units a year. 87% Romanian Orthodox, with Greek and Roman Catholic, Reformed/Lutheran, Unitarian, Muslim and Jewish minorities. A handshake is the most common form of greeting, but Romanian men may kiss a woman's hand when being introduced. Mr or Mrs should be used when greeting someone for the first time. Visitors should follow normal European courtesies on social occasions. Dress tends to be rather conservative but casual wear is suitable. Beachwear should not be worn away from the beach or poolside. If visiting a home, a small wrapped gift should be given to the host, such as flowers or chocolates (to women only), wine or liquor. Flowers should be given as a gift in odd numbers only. Many Romanians are smokers and gifts of Western cigarettes are greatly appreciated. Other well-appreciated gifts include toiletries. The Romanian government bans smoking in every public place, but, as in many countries in Eastern Europe, smokers have little respect for non-smokers and for smoking laws. Smoking is forbidden on planes, on buses and on some trains. Luxury hotels have designated no-smoking floors but very few restaurants have no-smoking sections. Military installations should not be photographed. Some tourist attractions require visitors to pay a fee (sometimes hefty) for taking photographs. Romanian is the official language. Some Hungarian and German are spoken in border areas, while mainly French and some English are spoken by those connected with the tourist industry.","Romania is a great year-round tourist destination. The best times to visit in terms of climate are the end of April to the beginning of July and from end of August to the end of October as temperatures are mild and pleasant. Summers can be hot especially in Southern Romania, including Bucharest, but along the Black Sea Coast, sea breezes offer moderate temperatures. Winters are coldest in the Carpathian Mountains where there is snow from December through to April. Snow also falls throughout most of the country during winter. The ski season in Romania runs from December to March, although high resorts such as Stana de Vale often remain open until late April. Prices are cheaper at the beginning and the end of the season, with Christmas often the busiest time.   On the Black Sea Coast, tourism reaches its height between June and August and temperatures during the summer months can reach a sizzling 40°C. Look for deals in May and September, when the weather is still balmy but the season isn’t yet in full swing.  Other seasonal activities include bird-watching (from mid-April to mid-May in the Danube Delta) and wine-tasting, which focuses around a series of festivals in September and October. Lightweights are worn in summer on the coast and in low inland areas. Warmer clothes are needed in winter and throughout the year in the uplands. Rainwear is recommended throughout the year. Romania is bordered by Moldova and Ukraine to the north and northeast; the Black Sea to the east; Bulgariato the south; and Serbia and Hungary to the west. The country is divided into 41 counties, but essentially there are four geographical regions with decidedly different characters; Transylvania, Moldova, Dobrogea and Muntenia.  Transylvania and Moldova comprise the northern half of the country and are characterised by Alpine massifs and dense forests. The Carpathian Mountains run along the border of these two regions and are made up of 14 mountain ranges above 2,000m (6,560ft) with Moldoveanu Peak at 2,544m (8,300ft) the highest point. The terrain around here is a mix of extinct volcanic cones, lunar plains, thick forests and glacial lakes – perfect for hiking, cycling and adrenaline sports. Muntenia, also known as Wallachia, lies south of the Carpathians and is home to the capital Bucharest. A relatively flat province, its border with Bulgaria is defined by the River Danube. In the southeast lies Dobrogea, which is home to the Danube Delta. The best-preserved delta in Europe, it is a haven for wildlife and has been declared a biosphere reserve and biodiversity World Heritage Site by UNESCO. The Dobrogea region boasts nearly 200 km (120 miles) of Black Sea coastline, incorporating the port of Constanta and the Danube Delta. Romania’s other major rivers include the Olt, the Siret and the Mures."
europe,russia,"Russia is at once breathtaking and baffling. Winston Churchill’s much-quoted line that the world’s largest nation represented “a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma” is as true today as it was back then. Monumental in every respect, it’s a land where burnished imperial splendour coexists with icy Siberian tundra, where timeworn Soviet-era monuments backdrop uber-hip urban cultures and where everything from the ruling party downwards functions in its own, impenetrably Russian, way. The west of the country draws the most visitor attention, thanks to the presence of two extraordinary cities. St Petersburg and Moscow serve up sweeping postcard sights by the dozen. Moscow is the rapidly beating heart of the “New Russia,” where Asia and Europe combine to create a boisterous, enigmatic metropolis on a grand scale. St Petersburg, meanwhile, with its living film-set of palaces, cathedrals and waterways, is the grandest and most European of Russia’s cities, yet still retains a deeply complex character. Exploration beyond these two main hubs, however, is well advised. The Golden Ring, a collection of ancient towns northeast of Moscow, still has plenty of period architecture and is easily accessed from the capital. By cruising along the mighty River Volga, meanwhile, it’s possible to travel south towards the Caspian Sea and see the country beyond its increasingly westernised veneer. And those heading east, into Siberia, will find a land of varied, often sublime natural beauty. From Lake Baikal to the old imperial city of rkutsk, and from the mountains of the Altai and the shamans of Tuva, Siberia has many secrets. A combination of the above is drawing an increasing number of tourists to the Russian Federation – that it remains as obscure and mysterious as ever is all part of the charm. As the poet Fyodor Tyutchev once said: “Russia cannot be understood.” 17,100,000 sq km (6,602,347 sq miles). 144,300,000 (2016). 8.4 per sq km. Moscow. Federal republic.

Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin since 2020.","Russia has been through staggering upheaval with consistently profound consequences – this is one place where history does not pass by quietly. Populated by Slavic tribes, by the mid-ninth century the first East Slavic state of Kievan Rus’ had emerged, stretching from Kiev in the south to Novgorod in the north, before it fell to the Mongol invasion during 13th century. In the 16th century under the rule of Ivan IV (the Terrible), Russia became a unified state and began the conquest of Siberia. Three centuries of Romanov rule commenced in 1613 when Michael Romanov was elected as tsar. Peter the Great has emerged as the most well known of this dynasty, transferring the country’s capital from Moscow to the newly built St Petersburg in 1703 as he looked to the countries of the west for inspiration to create a country that was their equal. From 1815, following the Napoleonic Wars, Russia saw a series of autocratic leaders and growing revolutionary tension, which came to a head during the reign of Nicholas II, the final Emperor. The October Revolution and death of the tsar and his family in 1917 lead to the formation of the Soviet Union, the world’s first Communist state. The death of the revolutionary leader Lenin saw Joseph Stalin emerge as the dominant force in the Communist Party and the start of Russia’s most brutal period in which collectivisation and rapid industrialisation were punctuated by purges and show trials. During the years prior to WWII Stalin dragged the Soviet Union to a position of superpower on the world stage, but at enormous human cost. The post war years ushered in the Cold War – a tense standoff between the Soviet Union and the West, which only came to a close with the break up of the Soviet Union in 1991. After the chaos of Yeltsin’s presidency in the 1990s, Vladimir Putin has maintained a firm grip over the Kremlin since winning the 2000 presidential election. When Dmitry Medvedev was elected President in 2008 Putin became Prime Minister, but returned to the presidency in 2012. For all his efforts to present a modern Russia to the world Putin seems increasingly content to plough his own furrow – deploying troops to Ukraine in 2014 and encouraging the accession of Crimea. Russia’s intervention in the Syrian Civil War in support of the Assad regime against Islamic State continues to divide opinion. Did you know? • Russia’s Soyuz rockets are the only means of transport for astronauts to the International Space Station. • In 2002, Russian Ark became the first feature-length film to be shot in a single take. • Russia’s national tree is the birch. Mainly Christian with the Russian Orthodox Church being the largest Christian denomination. Muslim, Buddhist and Jewish minorities also exist. It is customary to shake hands when greeting someone, though never across a threshold. Company or business gifts are well received; if you’re invited to someone’s home do bring a token gift, but avoid clearing your plate when eating; leaving some food is considered as a good sign. Conservative wear is suitable for most places – women will need to cover shoulders and wear long skirts to enter an orthodox church – and the seasonal weather should always be borne in mind. Smoking and drinking is widely acceptable, but the former has been prohibited in restaurants and cafes since 2014. Russian society is still highly patriarchal and hierarchical; this may be reflected in chivalrous acts (men holding doors open for women for example) but it may also mean that women are taken less seriously, and engaging in ‘unfeminine’ behaviour may be interpreted wrongly, although being a visitor may get you some leeway. Be careful with gestures – in Russia, giving the ‘thumbs up’ sign is an insult not an ‘OK’. It is prohibited to take photographs of any military installation and/or establishments or sites of strategic importance. Failure to abide by this could result in police arrest.   Russian is the official language, although there are over 100 other languages.

Wine = Vine Yes = Da","As you’d expect Russia’s climate is hugely dependent on where in the country you find yourself. With temperatures known to hit a tarmac-melting 37°C (99°F) in the cities and fall to -30°C (-22°F) and lower during the Siberian winter, there’s no point generalising about Russia’s weather except to say, be prepared. The most favourable temperatures are found along the Baltic coast, where many Muscovites decamp for balmy summer holidays, while the site of the 2014 Winter Olympics, Sochi, also doubles as a beach resort due to its tropical climate, earning it the epithet ‘Florida of Russia’. Minus the overly tanned pensioners of course. While the notion of visiting a snow-blanketed Moscow or St Petersburg has a definite romance, most tourists prefer to come calling in the warm summer months of June, July and August. This means the shoulder seasons of April, May, September and October are good options for visitors keen to avoid the peak crowds – prices are generally lower from September to May, and tourist sites almost invariably less crowded. Spring is often characterised by slushy roads. And if your heart’s set on that winter wonderland, December’s the best bet. Seasonal climates apply elsewhere in Russia – Siberia can have devastatingly cold winters, while its summers are generally fairly pleasant, if a little rainy. The region of Russia near the Black Sea has mild winters, but again attracts a fair amount of rain. Those visiting over summer should pack a mixture of lightweight and mediumweight clothing – natural fibres such as cotton and linen are best. For the winter visitor, meanwhile – layers, layers, layers. Wools and cashmeres are great material for keeping in the warmth. Sturdy shoes are always a good idea, no matter what time of year. The Russian Federation covers almost twice the area of the USA, and reaches from the enclave of Kaliningrad in the west over the Urals and the vast Siberian plains to the Sea of Okhotsk in the east. The border between European Russia and Siberia (Asia) is formed by the Ural Mountains, the Ural River and the Manych Depression. All in all, Russia has 16 international borders with countries including Finland, Lithuania, USA, Japan, Ukraine, Azerbaijan and China. European Russia extends from the North Polar Sea across the Central Russian Uplands to the Black Sea, the Northern Caucasus and the Caspian Sea. Siberia stretches from the West Siberian Plain across the Central Siberian Plateau to the Lena River and takes in the Sayan and Yablonovy ranges in the south. East of Siberia stretches the Russian Far East, a region almost as big as Siberia itself, running to the Pacific coast and including the vast Chukotka and Kamchatka peninsulas. Given the vast size of the country, Russia’s terrain is hugely variable. From the Siberian tundra to the mountains of the Urals, the beaches on the Black Sea coast, and the plains of western Russia, such variable geography means one can experience many different Russias."
europe,san-marino,"The origins of San Marino are based on the charming legend of Saint Marinus, who founded the community and the republic in AD301 after taking refuge on Mount Titano. The independence of San Marino was enshrined after Italian Unification, possibly in gratitude for at one time harbouring Garibaldi, the great leader of the Risorgimento. Apart from the Vatican City, it is the only city-state that is completely surrounded by another country. In whatever part of this 61 sq km (24 sq mile) territory you go, there seems to be a dazzling panorama at your disposal. But it is standing atop the spectacular Cesta Tower that will give you the best views. From the gorgeous Old Town clinging to the slopes, your gaze reaches across the fertile soils of Emilia Romagna, the soft rolling hills of the Marche, and on to the placid Adriatic sea. The Sammarinese territory is made up of nine ancient citadels, including the capital, San Marino. What the tiny city state lacks in size, it makes up for in history, museums and priceless architectural monuments. Meanwhile, a wealth of assorted crafts and souvenirs provide a vast, pleasant shopping experience. The free movement between San Marino and Italy, not to mention the fact that most locals support the Italian national team in football tournaments, might lead you to believe the territory’s independence lies in name only. But the Sammarinese have their own government and a distinct local culture. Everyone speaks Italian, but the San Marino dialect has failed to die out, while unique dishes such as white rabbit stew, black risotto and Cacciatello cake are local treasures. As well as imbibing the local food, other pleasant diversions include getting a colourful stamp in your passport at the State Post Office, visiting the impressive Three Towers of San Marino and the lavish Parliament Building. 61.2 sq km (23.6 sq miles). 31,950 (UN estimate 2016). 541.3 per sq km.

Like Andorra, Liechtenstein and Monaco, it is an anachronism, a reminder of the times when Europe , particularly Germany, Italy and the Pyrenees, was made up of tiny political units, often extending no further than a cannon could fire from a city's walls. Of all the small European countries, San Marino's survival is the most surprising. Apart from the Vatican City (whose development followed a different course), it is the only one in Europe that is completely surrounded by another country. The microstate's history of independence dates back a long way, and was preserved in acknowledgment of it services to the great 19th-century leader of Italian unification Giuseppe Garibaldi, whom it once gave haven to. Various treaties of friendship have been signed with Italy since Italian unification in 1871, but San Marino proudly asserts its independence where possible. It has been a full member of the Council of Europe since 1988, and chaired the organisation during the first half of 1990. Domestically, San Marino has evolved a pluralistic system of government similar to that in Italy. The major political parties are the Progressive Democrats (ex-communists), Socialists, Christian Democrats, Social Democrats and the leftist Partito Socialista Unitario. The country draws large numbers of tourists keen to see the tiny nation, which is packed full of historic buildings and beautiful countryside. Did you know? • Founded in 301 AD, San Marino claims to be the oldest surviving republic. • San Marino remained neutral in WWI and WWII. • If everyone in San Marino went to London's Wembley Stadium, there would be roughly 56,000 empty seats.

The landscape is for the most part green with rolling hills, dominated by the three peaks of Mount Titano. Within San Marino lie the capital of the same name and eight villages."
europe,channel-islands,"Life moves at an altogether slower pace on Sark and Herm. Floating off the coast of northern France, these lesser-known Channel Islands are amongst the last car-free islands in Europe – the only way to explore their secluded bays and wind-bitten headlands is by bike or on foot. How quaint. Though not part of France or the United Kingdom, Sark and Herm are officially classed as British Crown Dependencies and offer a chance to escape the trials and tribulations of life in mainland Europe. There’s plenty to keep visitors occupied. Indulge your taste buds with a gastronomic tour of the islands, sampling local produce at restaurants such as La Sablonnerie, Stocks Hotel and the Ship Inn Brasserie. Nature lovers are also well catered for. Climb down the rocky steps at La Grande Greve and explore one of the most stunning sandy bays in the Channel Islands or take your binoculars to Little Sark and scout for puffins and oystercatchers. Unspoiled by rampant development, Sark and Herm are almost entirely devoted to tourism and have long been popular day-tip destinations for those staying on the larger Channel Islands of Guernsey and Jersey. Despite their fledgling adventure tourism industry, which is focussed on coasteering and kayaking, Sark and Herm are essentially destinations based around peace, quiet and relaxation. If your idea of a great time is a quiet country ramble followed by an afternoon on the beach, a cream tea and then a fantastic evening meal, these tranquil islands are the place for you.

HM King Charles II since 2022, represented locally by Lieutenant Governor Richard Cripwell since 2022.","Swashbuckling pirates, secretive smugglers, daring invasions – the history of Sark and Herm reads more like a book of fairy tales than a plain account of fact. William the Conqueror annexed both islands to the Duchy of Normandy in 1066 when monks formed the majority of the population, but after the division of Normandy in 1204 the community dwindled. Herm became a hunting ground for the governors of Guernsey and Sark became a raiding base for pirates and smugglers. Both islands were occupied by the Nazis during WWII and Sark almost suffered a more recent invasion in 1990… from an unemployed nuclear physicist called Andre Gardes. He set out for Sark armed with a semi-automatic weapon and a box of flyers advertising his intention to seize control the next day at noon. The morning before the invasion he was tracked down by Sark’s constable, who complimented his weapon, persuaded him to hand it over and promptly arrested him. Sark has a fully democratic government – 28 members elected to the parliament, called the Chief Pleas. Its first full elections in 2008 ended the 450-year-old fiefdom and the island’s status as Europe’s last remaining feudal state. However, the feudal lord, the Seigneur (aka John Michael Beaumont, who inherited the title in 1974) remains in a largely ceremonial role. Herm is owned by the States of Guernsey and leased to a single tenant, on condition that the public has access to its foreshore and other parts of the island. Did you know? •	Until 2008 the Seigneur was the only person on Sark allowed to keep pigeons, or an unspayed dog. •	Sark has no tax on income, capital gains or inheritance and no VAT on goods and services. •	There is no airport on Sark and it is a car-free zone.

The most popular holiday season is from April to October, with temperatures averaging 20-21°C (68-70°F). These months give an average of 200 and 260 hours of sunshine. Rainfall is mainly during the cooler months. The sea is 17°C (63°F) on average during the summer. Take a stout pair of shoes for negotiating the uneven roads and footpaths. Waterproof clothing is also recommended. Sark and Herm are close to mainland France. To the east of the islands lies Guernsey, to the west the Normandy coast, to the north Alderney and to the south Jersey. Just 2.4km (1.5 miles) long and 0.8km (0.5 miles) wide, Herm is largely flat and is dominated by its sandy beaches. The tiny island of Jethou, which lies just off its south coast, was connected to Herm before a storm washed away the land that connected the two in the late eighth century.   Sark’s landmass is divided into two parts – Greater Sark and Little Sark – which are connected by a narrow belt of land called La Coupee. Until protective railings were erected here at the beginning of the 20th century, residents wishing to cross had to crawl on their hands and knees to avoid being blown over the side. The island’s highest point is just 114m (374 ft) above sea level, and is nicknamed Le Moulin after the windmill that once stood there. Its interior is mainly gently rolling fields bordered by sandy bays and dramatic granite cliffs – the sea cave formations that pepper these cliffs are one of the most spectacular features on Sark. The island of Brecqhou to the west, owned by the Barclay brothers since 1993, is also officially part of Sark."
europe,united-kingdom,"Crammed with sky-high mountains, rugged coastlines, romantic lochs, cultured cities and fiercely proud people, Scotland is an incredible destination with a wealth of attractions begging to be explored. A holiday in Scotland means you could be quaffing single malt in the Lowland or following the footsteps of noble clansmen in the Highlands. That's assuming you aren't busy trailing Harry Potter on the real Hogwarts Express (the Jacobite Express steam train made famous in the Harry Potter films), tracking red deer in Cairngorms National Park, or lighting up your social media with jaw-dropping images taken while cruising along the North Coast 500, Scotland's answer to Route 66. Scotland's largest cities, Glasgow and Edinburgh, are excellent city-break destinations where visitors can immerse themselves in the culture at various museums and galleries, in addition to shopping and fine dining. Beyond the cities, Scotland's charming historic towns, coastal villages and remote, Gaelic-speaking Highland communities also entice visitors with their scenic walks and warm welcomes. Visitors who are after an electrifying festival experience won't be disappointed either. For three weeks in August, Edinburgh plays host to the Fringe, the world's largest arts festival. The varied programmes include cabaret, comedy, circus, dance, exhibitions, musicals, opera, spoken word events and theatre. Then there are the more eccentric Coal Carrying Race in Kelty and Porridge Making Championships in Carrbridge, among others. Scotland is also a popular destination for outdoor enthusiasts. Adrenaline-junkies can hurtle down the rapids on the mighty River Findhorn near Aviemore, get behind the wheel of a supercar at Knockhill Racing Circuit, or snowboard at Cairngorm Mountain. If you prefer a more genteel diversion, tee off at St Andrews, the world-famous 'Home of Golf'.

Met with fearsome Caledonian tribes known as the Picts, the Romans failed to conquer Scotland and left by 212 AD. Then in the 9th century the Vikings arrived, and a few centuries later, the infamous power-grab from England began in 1296 when England's monarch, Edward I, believed that he should rule over Scotland. This resulted in two wars – the Battle of Stirling Bridge (1297) and the Battle of Bannockburn (1314). Eventually, England's Edward II agreed to recognise Scotland's independence in 1328. In 1603, James VI of Scotland took the English and Irish thrones as James I, following the death of England's Elizabeth I who was childless. The union between Scotland and England was further reinforced in the 1707 Treaty. Nonetheless, the spirit of independence remained strong and sparked several Jacobite Risings. In 1746, the ultimate and tragic Battle of Culloden saw the Jacobite army defeated by British forces. In 1997, Scotland voted for a devolved government and the new government body met for the first time on 12 May 1999 in Edinburgh. The devolution means that the Scottish government is responsible for the country's economy, education, health, justice, rural affairs, housing, environment, equal opportunities, consumer advocacy and advice, transport and taxation. Did you know? • Scotland's national flower is the thistle. • Scotland has 790 islands, of which only 130 are inhabited. • Scottish Gaelic, an ancient Celtic language that evolved from Old Irish, is one of the four official languages.

Being punctual is essential, and wise to include 'please' and 'thank you' in your conversations. When going out for a meal, it is polite to wait until everyone is served before eating. Casual wear is widely accepted, but a more formal dress code is often required for important meetings and social functions. Scotland has four official languages: English (the main spoken language), Gaelic (spoken in some communities in the Highlands and Scottish Islands), Scots (similar to English and spoken in pockets of the Lowlands) and British Sign Language.","The climate in Scotland is primarily oceanic, meaning it is often cool, rainy, and windy, with temperatures a few degrees lower than the rest of the UK. Rain is common throughout Scotland, with the west side (including the Highlands) wetter and warmer than the east, due to the warm air from the Gulf Stream. For instance, Glasgow on the west coast has an average rainfall of 1,300mm (51in) a year, whereas Edinburgh on the east coast receives almost half of that, averaging 700mm (28in) a year. Spring (March to May) is comparatively cold, with Edinburgh seeing an average mean of 11°C (52°F) in May. In Glasgow, temperatures are slightly lower than in Edinburgh. Summer (June to August) is cool and rainy, with very short, sunny periods occurring from time to time. Summer is widely considered to be the best time to visit Scotland as temperatures are warmer than other times of the year. In Edinburgh, the average mean in July is 15°C (59°F). In August, the moors and slopes of the Highlands are draped in purple Scottish heather and are most beautiful. Autumn (September to November) sees temperatures dropping rapidly as the season progresses. This period is also windy, especially in mountainous areas. October is best for visitors who want to experience the colours of autumn and the sound of rustling leaves. Winter (December to January) is cold, with over 100 snowing days in the Highlands, compared to just 15-20 snowing days elsewhere in Scotland. In Edinburgh, the average mean in January is 4°C (39°F). The weather in Scotland is often cool, wet and windy, and can be unpredictable due to the cold air from the north and warm air from the Gulf Stream. Accordingly, use layers to keep yourself warm, even during the summer months. Regardless of when you go, waterproof garments are essential. Scotland shares a land border with England, and is bounded by the Atlantic Ocean to the west and north, and the North Sea to the east. The physical features of mainland Scotland can be categorised into three parts: the Northern Highlands, the Central Lowlands and the Southern Uplands. The Northern Highlands are dominated by a series of mountain ranges such as the Grampians, the Cairngorms, and the Cuillins (on the Isle of Skye). Ben Nevis, at 1,344m (4,409ft) and the highest peak in the British Isles, is in the west of the Highlands. The Central Lowlands, sandwiched between the Highlands and the Southern Uplands, stretches from the Firth of Forth on the east coast to the Firth of Clyde on the west coast. Edinburgh and Glasgow are located on either side of the Central Lowlands. The sparsely populated Southern Uplands lie just north of the land border with England. Hills, lochs and rivers dominate the landscapes. Wanlockhead, a former lead-mining village sitting at 467m (1,532ft) and said to be the highest village in Scotland, is located here. Scotland's longest river is the Tay, which runs 193km (120 mi) from Ben Lui to the Firth of Tay (south of Dundee). Tay is important to the populations of salmon and is regarded as one of the finest angling rivers in Scotland."
europe,serbia,"Although its reputation took a hammering during the disastrous collapse of Yugoslavia in the 1990s, Serbia has since become one of Eastern Europe’s most entertaining destinations. Much of that is down to Belgrade, which, despite NATO bombing during the Milosevic regime, has emerged as a dynamic, edgy city with an appetite for hedonism. Home to numerous excellent museums and galleries, a wide range of restaurants and cafés, and some of the best nightlife in southeast Europe, Belgrade is drawing comparisons with some of the world’s coolest cities. It is also helping lead the rest of the country into a bright and hopeful future, with a young generation of creative and outward-looking Serbs reshaping the historic land that was founded as a principality some 1,200 years ago. Away from the capital, Novi Sad is an attractive, lively city with an elegant centre and picturesque fortress overlooking over the Danube. In the far north, Subotica has an array of secessionist architecture and a notable Hungarian character. The province of Vojvodina, north of Belgrade, has some excellent wetland habitats that are home to numerous bird species, while south of the capital the countryside consists of lush, wooded valleys with hidden-away Orthodox monasteries. Scattered among the country's more mountainous regions are a number of vast national parks. Serbia is known for the forthright character of its citizens; its resilient culture has survived numerous occupiers and foreign rulers over the centuries. Despite their formidable reputation, visitors will find Serbs to be passionate but welcoming. As an Orthodox Christian country, it remains to a large degree deeply religious, though this fact is belied somewhat by the hedonism found in its bigger cities. While there are still some political problems in Serbia, which has yet to formally recognise Kosovo after it unilaterally declared independence in 2008, the country has turned a corner. It is officially a EU candidate and many Serbs are hopeful of the change in economic fortunes that might be brought by becoming a full member. 77,474 sq km (35,246 sq miles). 8,812,705 (UN estimate 2016). 92.6 per sq km.

Prime Minister Milos Vucevic since May 2024.","Inhabited since prehistoric times and conquered by Celts, Greeks and Romans over the ages, the area occupied by modern-day Serbia has had a potted history. But the country's story really begins with the arrival of the Serbs on the borders of the Byzantine Empire in the 6th and 7th centuries. Cyril and Methodius converted the Serbs to Orthodox Christianity in the 9th century, which led to years of struggle and cooperation with the Byzantines. By the 13th century, Serbia was independent – but not for long. As the Byzantine Empire was taken over by the Ottomans, the Turks commenced half a millennium of rule over the Serbs. This era changed many aspects of the country's culture – notably the cuisine – without fundamentally altering the Serbian identity, which remained Orthodox Christian and rather proud of its embattled history. During the 19th century, Serbs gained control over their country again, but the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand by a Bosnian Serb triggered the invasion of Serbia by Austria-Hungary and the start of WWI. The aftermath of the war saw the beginnings of Yugoslavia, initially a kingdom composed of Croatia, Slovenia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia and Macedonia. Serbian resistance to fascist rule during WWII led to great suffering at the hands of the Nazis, though the partisans led by one Josip Broz Tito won the day; Tito eventually became the leader of post-war Yugoslavia, managing to unite the disparate contingents of the country while he lived. Later, though, Serbian dominance of Yugoslavia led to violence and the bloody disintegration of the composite state. The culmination of this was the attempt by the Serbs to empty Kosovo of its Albanian population, leading to the US and NATO-led bombing of the country in 1999. In 2000, the infamous reign of Milosevic finally came to an end when he tried to deny the results of the country's presidential elections; Serbs took to the streets in Belgrade and in 2001 Milosevic was arrested and extradited to The Hague to face claims of war crimes. Montenegro left its union with Serbia in 2003, while Kosovo declared independence in 2008; to date, Serbia has not formally recognised the latter state. The country currently has candidate status to become a member of the European Union. Did you know? • It is believed that the Vinča, who occupied the Serbian area around 6000 BC, had one of the earliest known forms of writing. • Due to the indomitable resistance to fascist rule, Serb deaths during WWII are thought to number as much as half a million. • Prime minister Zoran Ðinđić was assassinated in 2003; he was instrumental in bringing about Milosevic's extradition to The Hague.

europe,slovakia,"Like the Czech Republic minus the crowds, Slovakia may sit in the shadows of its neighbour, but the country quietly impresses with its epic alpine scenery, clifftop castles and exquisite capital. Following the 'Velvet Divorce' of 1993, which saw Czechoslovakia split into two constituent parts (the Czech Republic and Slovakia), the nation set about reasserting its independent spirit, and today there's a humble, creative nature to Slovakia that wins over visitors of all stripes. Enthusiastic about art and music, the country is even home to a burgeoning hip-hop scene. A small country of just five million odd inhabitants, Slovakia appeals to a broad range of travellers: from backpackers and businesspeople, to skiers and history buffs. It has one or two surprises up its sleeve. It is, for example, quietly gaining prestige as an alternative skiing destination. With its modern skiing infrastructure and new budget flights, Slovakia’s High Tatras mountains are becoming a tantalising destination for winter sports enthusiasts. As for the capital, it may be compared unfavourably with its neighbour, Prague, but Bratislava is nevertheless an alluring option for a city break. With an air of glamorous Vienna, it is home to gorgeous churches dating back to the 15th century, countless cafes squeezed onto cobblestone streets, and a slew of terrific, sometimes quirky museums. Part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire for centuries, Bratislava’s architecture is grand Central European in style. It was the Hungarian capital for nearly 300 years, with 11 monarchs crowned in the extraordinary 500-year-old St Martin’s Cathedral. Beyond its stunning capital, Slovakia boasts some impressive natural landscapes, which remain relatively unspoiled and uncrowded. The country has 10 national parks to speak of, which offer sprawling forests, rolling hills and meandering rivers. Though Bratislava and the High Tatras mountains remain the star attractions in Slovakia, beyond them lies a diverse and decidedly beautiful land, rich in rewards for those bold enough to explore it. 49,033 sq km (18,932 sq miles). 5,429,418 (UN estimate 2016). 111 per sq km. Bratislava. Republic. President Zuzana Čaputová since 2019. Prime Minister Robert Fico since October 2023.","Throughout its history, Slovakia has been dominated by foreign powers. Slavic tribes were settling in this area towards the end of the Roman Empire, when the area was subject to incursions by nomadic Magyar tribes, who settled and created an embryonic Hungarian state. A major military defeat in 1526 at the Battle of Mohacs at the hands of the Ottoman Turks signalled the end of the prosperous and peaceful period they inaugurated. Allying itself with the Austrian Hapsburg monarchy, the burgeoning Slovak people resisted the Ottoman occupation and remained under the effective control of the Austro-Hungarian Empire until the late 18th century. The first nationalist movements started to emerge during this time. One of the most potent of these was led by Ludovit Stur and Andrej Hlinka (whose name was adopted by the Slovak WWII fascist movement, the Hlinka Guard). With the end of WWI, and the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, Czechoslovakia was born, and with it an age of prosperity that lasted until 1938. During WWII, the first Slovak Republic was formed and Slovakia joined the Axis as a client state of Nazi Germany. The Germans occupied the republic in 1944, along with the rest of Czechoslovakia, but were pushed out by the Red Army, Romanian forces and Czechoslovakian troops. The liberated territories then became part of Czechoslovakia. After WWII, Czechoslovakia became a Soviet satellite state and spent the following decades behind the Iron Curtain. Democratic reforms in November 1989 – and the fall of the Berlin Wall – led to the appointment of Václav Havel as president, who helped the country introduce a pluralistic political system and a market economy. While appreciating the new opportunities offered by the post-Soviet order, the Slovaks were worried about the liberalisation programme planned by Havel and his finance minister, Václav Klaus, and there was a period of uncertainty. However, the first democratic elections were held in 1990, and the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) became the dominant force in Slovak politics. The separation of Czechoslovakia into its constituent parts – the Czech and Slovak Republics – on 1 January 1993 was one of the rare occasions in history that two nations have accomplished such a divorce peacefully. This separation is known as the Velvet Divorce. A period of economic reforms in the early 2000s preceded Slovakia's entry into the European Union in 2004. Did you know? •	Although the Slovak people have been around since the Roman Empire, the separation of Czechoslovakia in 1993 marked the emergence of an independent and sovereign Slovak nation for the first time. •	The picturesque village of Čičmany in northern Slovakia, full of traditional wooden houses, claims to be the first reservation of folk architecture in the world. •	Bordering Austria and Hungary, Bratislava is the only capital in the world that borders two countries.

europe,slovenia,"Though it may lack the pulling power of its heavyweight neighbours, this charming country is rich in rewards for travellers willing to take a punt. Sandwiched between Italy, Austria, Hungary and Croatia, this tiny nation occupies a picturesque pocket of Europe, which is characterised by verdant valleys, glacial lakes and snow-capped mountains. Slovenia has been greatly influenced by the countries surrounding it; the baroque architecture, ancient castles and sophisticated cuisine are evocative of western neighbours, while the quaint rural villages, Slavic language and low prices have a decidedly eastern feel. But, Slovenia has its own identity. The first of the former Yugoslavian states to join the EU, the country is a progressive, forward-thinking nation. Its people are easy-going and welcoming to outsiders. Most travellers begin their Slovenian adventure in the capital, Ljubljana, a charming university city whose resident academics give the place a youthful vibe. Carved in two by the Ljubljana River, the city is peppered with cafés, independent shops and a gamut of excellent restaurants. It has a laidback vibe and a calm ambiance, unlike most capitals on the continent. But it’s when you step outside the capital that Slovenia showcases her true charms; the beautiful Adriatic coastal towns; the rolling vineyards of Jeruzalem-Ormož; the picture-perfect lake Bled; the caves of Postojna and Skocjan; and the black ski runs of Kranjska Gora. Slovenia is a particularly attractive proposition to outdoor enthusiasts and adrenaline junkies, who can try anything from cycling, hiking and paragliding to white-water rafting, caving and mountaineering. Less adventurous visitors can occupy themselves basking on beaches, people-watching in cafés or quaffing some of the country’s excellent wines.   20,273 sq km (7,827 sq miles). 2,067,372 (2018 est.) 102 per sq km. Ljubljana. Parliamentary Constitutional Republic. President Natasa Pirc Musar since 2022. Prime Minister Robert Golob since 2022.","An independent nation since 1991, the territory of present-day Slovenia has a rich and tumultuous history that belies its age. Until the early 20th century, foreign kingdoms –Holy Roman Empire, the Frankish Empire and Austro-Hungarian Empire – controlled Slovenia. The Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, a territory later renamed Yugoslavia, then absorbed the Slovenian area at the end of WWI. But the turmoil continued in 1941 when the Axis powers invaded Yugoslavia and carved up Slovenia between Germany, Italy and Hungary. This invasion was met with unexpectedly fierce resistance in the form of the Yugoslav Communist Party, led by Josip Broz Tito, who helped defeat the aggressors in 1945 and establish the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Slovenia became a constituent republic of this new federation, but the ruling League of Communists of Slovenia (LCS) sought greater autonomy from Belgrade, Yuguslavia's capital. Their opposition was muted, however, after similar calls from Croatia were forcefully suppressed by Tito in 1971. Slovenia’s liberal political atmosphere quickly proved the antithesis of the autocratic climate in Serbia under Slobodan Milosevic. In 1990, it became the first Yugoslavian federal state to hold multi-party elections, which DEMOS, a six-party centre-right coalition, won. Slovenia’s liberal political atmosphere – the antithesis to the autocratic climate in Serbia under Slobodan Milosevic – saw it holding the first multi-party elections in 1990, which were won by a six-party centre-right coalition, calling itself DEMOS. After 14 months, during which both Slovenia and Croatia became increasingly alienated from Belgrade, Slovenia declared independence. The central government immediately sent in armoured convoys to take control of federal border posts and key installations in the capital Ljubljana. The army clearly did not expect the resistance put up by Slovene irregulars. After 10 days of sporadic and largely inconclusive fighting, the two sides reached a ceasefire. By the end of October 1991 all federal military forces had left the republic. Full international recognition followed in May 1992, after which the DEMOS government collapsed, having achieved its sole objective of securing global acknowledgment. Slovenia was admitted to the United Nations in May 1992 and joined the EU in May 2004, becoming the first of the former Yugoslav republics to attain membership. In over two decades, Slovenia has undergone a remarkable transformation from a controlled federal state to an independent, democratic nation and eurozone member. It was a bumpy ride – the worldwide financial crisis of 2008 hit this fledgling nation particularly hard – but the future seems to be bright for this young country of two million.

europe,spain,"From riotous fiestas and sizzling cuisine to world-class museums and cutting-edge art galleries, there's a reason why Spain endures as one of the world's most popular destinations. Like the country's famous tapas, Spain itself is a tempting smorgasbord of bustling cities, scenic countryside and sunny islands, which visitors can nibble away at on repeat trips or consume in one giant feast. Either way, it is one appetising nation. In spite of its myriad attractions, most come to Spain for sun, sand and self-indulgence, flocking to the likes of the Costa del Sol and Costa Brava, whiling away days on beaches and nights in clubs. An early pioneer of package holidays, Spain's leading resorts have long been geared up for the mass market – from the Balearics to the Canary Islands – but it's not all sprawling hotel complexes; quaint fishing villages, bijou retreats and secluded beaches abound if you’re looking to veer off the tourist trail. Spain is much more than holidays in the sun, though. Away from the beach there's an extraordinary variety of things to do; from climbing snow-capped peaks in the Pyrénées to hiking the ancient pilgrimage route of St James's Way; from diving in the protected Medes Islands to stargazing in Tenerife. Alternatively, you could drop in on one of the country's many festivals (think Running of the Bulls, La Tomatina and the Baby Jumping Festival) which are madder than a box of frogs. And then there are the cities; Madrid, Barcelona, Bilbao, Seville, Valencia, the list goes on. Each one of these vibrant metropolises has their own distinct flavour; the Dali architecture and sweeping beaches of Barcelona seem a long way from the wide boulevards and soaring skyscrapers of Madrid (though the Catalans may wish it was further).  But for all their disparities, these cities are bound by Spain's remarkable history and enviable cultural feats, which are proudly displayed in the country's museums, galleries and UNESCO World Heritage Sites.

Remains found in the Atapuerca Mountains indicate that man first arrived in Spain almost one million years ago. The Phoenicians, Greeks, Romans and Visigoths would all later settle here and, in the 8th century, Muslims came to the Iberian Peninsula, kick-starting a centuries-long power struggle between Muslims and Christians, with the latter group eventually establishing the upper hand in the 15th century. In terms of global influence, Spain’s heyday came between the 16th and mid-17th centuries. During this era, the Spaniards led a charge on the newly discovered New World, hijacking valuable minerals and metals to bankroll the Crown. The Spanish Empire soon became the most extensive the world had ever seen, encompassing territory across Europe, the Americas, Africa and Asia. However, the superpower began to fade in the early 1800s when Napoleon took over Spain. An atmosphere of political instability and uncertainty gave rise to anti-colonial revolts, while many of the country’s colonial conquests broke free. In the 1930s, Spain suffered tremendously from a civil war, resulting in massacres of civilians and prisoners all over the nation. The war cost hundreds of thousands of lives and ended in a nationalist dictatorship, led by General Francisco Franco. During his 36-year rule, Spain remained largely isolated from the outside world – both economically and culturally. The death of Franco in 1975 marked a new era for Spain: a rapid transition from dictatorship to liberal democracy and the return of the Bourbon monarch headed by Prince Juan Carlos. In 1981, members of the Guardia Civil attempted a coup d’etat but failed, thanks to the intervention of the King. Spain joined the European Union (then known as European Economic Community) in 1986 and adopted the Euro in 1999. Since hosting the 1992 Olympics and Seville Expo, the country has undergone significant progress in development, including social reforms such as the legalisation of same-sex marriage, the modernisation of divorce laws and an increase of the minimum wage, as well as infrastructural improvements. Like many of the European states, Spain was hit hard by the 2008 recession and required a rescue package to help keep its shaky banking sector afloat. A decade later, the economy of Spain is growing again thanks to its vast tourism industry, an active construction sector and a rise in public expenditure. In 2017, Catalonia declared it would become independent, however this did not receive recognition from the international community.

There is no official religion in Spain. Approximately 67% of the population is Roman Catholic, while 28% has no religion. The young generation are less religious than before, but most still celebrate religious festivals. There are approximately 1 million Muslims (2.3% of the country) living in Spain. Spanish life has undergone rapid change in recent decades and stricter religious customs have been superseded by more modern ways, particularly in the cities and among women. In spite of this, traditions remain strong; hospitality, chivalry and courtesy thrive. Handshaking is the customary form of greeting between men, while women (outside of a business context) are greeted with a fleeting kiss to either cheek (left then right). Spaniards eat late; lunch around 1400-1530; the evening meal 2100-2300. The Spanish have two family names; the maternal surname follows the paternal, but is rarely used outside a formal context. Smoking has long been banned in offices, shops, schools, hospitals, cultural centres and on public transport, but in 2011 that ban was extended to all bars, cafes and restaurants. Spain now has one of the toughest anti-smoking laws in Europe.  The official language is Spanish (Castilian). Other languages spoken in the first language in Spain include Euskera (in Basque Country, northeastern Spain), Catalan (in Eastern Spain, with variations spoken in Valencia and the Balearics) and Galician (in the northwest). There are also various regional dialects, but you’ll have no problems getting around Spain with knowledge of Castilian Spanish. English is not commonly used, so be sure to pick up some basic Spanish words before your trip.","Spain's climate varies from temperate in the north to dry and hot in the south. As it is a big country with varying terrain and altitudes, climate can be extremely distinctive from one corner to another. Overall, the country has three main climate zones: • The Mediterranean climate from the southern Atlantic coastal region to Andalusia. Blessed with mild temperatures and long days, these places are excellent to visit all year round. • The semi-arid climate in the south-eastern quarter of the country. • The oceanic climate in the Atlantic region (Basque Country, Cantabria, Asturias, and partly Galicia, Castile–León and the Pyrenean valleys). The best time to visit depends on the region and type of travel experience you’re seeking. For a beach vacation, the best months for guaranteed sunshine are June to August. Naturally, these are also the busiest months for tourism along the coast and on the Spanish islands, so be prepared for high prices and crowds. If you're looking to escape the crowds, head inland to cities like Seville and Granada where temperatures are sizzling but streets aren't as crowded as the coastal cities. The shoulder season for travel in Spain is usually late spring and autumn: from April to end of May and October to November. These are when tourist destinations are least crowded and weather is still pleasant. January to February is the best time to ski – there are about 35 ski resorts in Spain and they generally have a good amount of snow and also a fair amount of sunshine. In the Sierra Nevada, the sun can be quite overwhelming even in the snow – come prepared with snow goggles and sunscreen. • Click here to see the weather & best time to visit Madrid guide. From June to August on the coastal areas, casual beach wear such as flip flops, vests, loose fitting clothing and shorts will suffice. It can get unbearably hot in the city, so be prepared to brave the weather with plenty of water, a hat and sunscreen. In between high and low season (April-May; October-November) the climate can be unpredictable in certain parts of the country, be sure to pack your umbrella, raincoat and a light jacket for the night. Spain shares the Iberian Peninsula with its smaller neighbour, Portugal, and is bordered to the northeast by the Pyrenees mountain range that cuts across France and Andorra. Surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea, Spain has numerous stretches of coastline that are extremely crowded, especially in summer. Spain has two main groups of islands that are popular with tourists: the Balearic Islands (Mallorca, Menorca, Ibiza and Formentera) located 193km (120 miles) southeast of Barcelona, and the Canary Islands off the west coast of Africa (mainly Tenerife, Gran Canaria, Fuerteventura, Lanzarote and La Palma). Located in continental Africa, the tiny enclaves of Ceuta and Melilla also form a part of Spain. Mainland Spain is the second highest and most mountainous country in Europe, with an average height of 610m (2,000ft). The Pyrenees stretch roughly 400km (249 miles) from the Basque Country's Atlantic coast. In places the peaks rise to over 1,524m (5,000ft), the highest point being 3,404m (11,169ft). The main physical feature of Spain is the vast central plateau, or Meseta Central, divided by several chains of sierras. The higher northern area includes Castile and León and the southern section comprises Castile-La Mancha and Extremadura. In the south, the high plains rise further at the Sierra Morena before falling abruptly at the great valley of the Guadalquivir. Southeast of Granada is the Sierra Nevada, which runs parallel to the Mediterranean. Its summit Mulhacen, at 3,718m (12,198ft), is the highest point on the Spanish peninsula. The highest peak in Spain is the Pico del Teide on Tenerife in the Canaries, measuring a height of 3,718m (12,198ft)."
europe,sweden,"Sweden is a land of incredible contrasts, from the dense pine forests and craggy mountains of the north, to the rolling hills and glossy golden beaches of the south. But the diversity doesn't stop at the suburbs, with each of Sweden's seven major cities boasting its own character, history and unique architectural style. Bordered by Denmark to the south, Norway to the west and Finland to the east, Sweden, the largest of the Scandinavian countries, boasts a long mercantile history that has made it one of the most culturally open and welcoming in Europe. The instantly likeable capital Stockholm has long been synonymous with style and its sharply tailored brand of chic has percolated throughout the wardrobes of the world. Hipsters notwithstanding, Stockholm, with its 14 islands and medieval beauty, has much to offer those in search of culture, art and historical treasures. However, perhaps the most surprising city is Malmö, which has belied its unfairly grim reputation to become one of the country's liveliest destinations. Beyond the cities, Sweden's countryside has a gentler charm than the rugged landscapes of neighbouring Norway. Much of Sweden is forested and there are thousands of lakes, including the large stretches of water between Gothenburg and Stockholm. The border with Norway is home to the spectacular Skanderna (Scandinavian) mountain chain, while in the far north you'll find wonderfully bleak Arctic tundra, where you can see the Northern Lights. The south is dominated by emerald forests, the cerulean waters of the Gulf of Bothnia and the jagged Baltic coastline. Of all the lovely spots in Sweden though, the awe-inspiring panoramas of the Stora Sjöfallet National Park take some beating. Part of the UNESCO-listed Laponian region of northern Sweden, the park's majestic waterfalls, soaring peaks and crowded clumps of fir trees make it one of the country's greatest natural treasures. The Swedes are proud of their green country and believe the great outdoors should be available to everyone. Allemansrätten – the everyman's right – is a constitutional right that allows the public access to public and privately owned land for recreation.

From 800 until the mid-11th century, Sweden's Vikings took eastern Europe and Byzantium by storm; sacking monasteries, carrying off shiploads of plunder and providing some of the most memorably monikered characters to walk the Earth, including Ingvar the Far-Travelled and Eric the Victorious. Towards the end of this period, the modern kingdom of Sweden came into being and some sense of order followed the accession of Margaret – Regent of Denmark and ruler of Norway – in 1387. She attempted to establish a united Scandinavia, but this did not last long and during the 15th century the nobility was able to do much as it pleased.   The most significant event of this period was the Massacre of Stockholm in 1520, occasioned by Christian of Denmark’s attempt to reassert his authority in Sweden. During the resulting revolt, headed by Gustav Ericksson Vasa, the Danes were defeated and Gustav established the House of Vasa as monarchs. Much of the foreign policy of the 17th century was expansionist and despite his Protestantism, Gustav II allied with Catholic France as Sweden won the last remaining Baltic territories not under its control – Prussia and Pomerania. The next couple of centuries saw the country lose the majority of its territory outside of Scandinavia as a succession of royal dynasties playing a gilded sort of musical chairs with the throne. By 1818, the Bernadotte family (which still rules) had taken control, but while the country’s political leadership was assured, its overseas territories remained in a state of flux thanks to the emergence of Norwegian nationalism, which culminated in Norway’s declaration of full independence in 1905. By this time, parliamentary government had emerged in Sweden. The Social Democrats first gained power in the early 1920s and rule almost continuously from 1932 until 1976. Since the end of World War 2, in which Sweden remained neutral (as it had done in World War 1), the country has enjoyed growing economic prosperity with continued investment in, and expansion of, the welfare state. Did you know? • The Roman historian Tacitus was the first to write about Sweden in the Germania. • Sweden has not been at war since it allied with Napoleon against Norway in 1814. • On 6 June 2016, to mark the 50th anniversary of the day they first met, ABBA’s Benny Andersson and Bjorn Ulvaeus, were joined by fellow members Agnetha Fältskog and Anni-Frid Lyngstad to perform at a private party. Around 65% of the population belong to the Church of Sweden (Evangelical Lutheran), which separated from the state in January 2000. The remainder belong to minority Protestant denominations although the country also has significant numbers of Catholics, Eastern Orthodox Christians and Muslims. Normal courtesies should be observed. It is customary for the guest to refrain from drinking until the host makes a toast. The guest should also thank the host for the meal by saying tack för maten (thank you for the food). Casual dress is acceptable for everyday occasions; smarter threads are worn for social occasions, exclusive restaurants and clubs. Evening wear (black tie) will usually be specified when required. Smoking is prohibited on public transport and in most public buildings. The main language is Swedish but Sámi (Lapp) is spoken by the Sámi population in the north. There are also Finnish, Meänkieli, Romani and Yiddish-speaking minorities. English is taught as the first foreign language from an early age.

Far north, stick to woollen layers closest to your skin, and avoid cotton socks. Sturdy footwear, scarves, hats and gloves will be required regardless of where you are. During the summer, lighter clothing is all you need. Shorts or jeans and a t-shirt is standard attire, with a light jacket or sweater for the evenings. Cobblestones in the city, and unpaved roads in the countryside, means flat shoes or sandals are best for getting around. Waterproof clothing is recommended year round. With a land mass totalling around 449,964 sq km (173,732 sq miles), Sweden is the fifth largest country in Europe and the largest of the Scandinavian bloc. Sharing land borders with Norway to the west and Finland to the northeast, the country also has 3,218km (2,000 miles) of coastline, much of it on the Baltic Sea. What remains faces the Gulf of Bothnia – a chilly stretch of sea, shared with Finland. To the south, Denmark is another near neighbour and is directly linked to the southern Swedish port of Malmö via the Öresund Bridge. Along with Denmark, Sweden has maritime borders with Germany, Poland, Russia, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia. With a population of over 9 million, most of whom inhabit the cities and the south, the vast majority (78%) of Sweden’s enormous tracts of land are forested, while another 8% is covered in water. The largest lake is Vänern, with an area of 5,655 sq km (2,140 sq miles) and the highest peak is Kebnekaise, which stands 2,104m (6,903ft) above sea level and is part of the Scandinavian mountain chain on the Norwegian border. In the far north, Sweden’s portion of Lapland extends well into the Arctic Circle, with the northernmost outpost of Swedish civilisation to be found in the tiny Lappish town of Treriksröset on the three way border between Finland, Norway and Sweden. The country’s southernmost point is the small fishing village of Smygehuk on the Baltic coast, close to the tiny city of Trelleborg in Skåne County."
europe,switzerland,"Combining expansive greenery, slick cities and bucketfuls of fresh air, Switzerland is a stylish tourist destination that offers countless outdoor adventures and contemporary urban breaks. Switzerland’s Alpine vistas are so picture perfect, they appear to have been plucked from a postcard or the pages of a storybook. But these disarming landscapes are alive and kicking, as the myriad spots for skiing, hiking or mountain biking can attest. Ski resorts like Zermatt (home to the lofty Matterhorn), Verbier and celebrity-studded St Moritz provide everything from big, bad Olympic runs to encouragingly gentle novice slopes. And when the snow melts at low altitudes, the white-tipped mountain peaks remain against a backdrop of blue skies, providing a superb setting for summertime hiking. The ancient capital Berne provides almost endless opportunities for sightseeing, shopping and traditional folk entertainment, while Zurich leads the way in art, design and nightlife, from opera and world-class theatre to stylish bars and nightclubs. Geneva is the sleekest and most upscale of Switzerland's cities, acting as home to a thriving community of expats, many of whom work for the numerous international organisations that are headquartered there. Yet Switzerland’s cultural offerings don’t stop there. When it comes to contemporary art, polished Basel reigns supreme, with more than 40 museums and galleries nestled in this compact city. For a few days every year, Basel takes centre stage for the eminent Art Basel fair. French-flavoured Montreux also steals a moment in the cultural spotlight when it becomes the centre of focus for the jazz world during the Montreux Jazz Festival. Elsewhere, dotted around green foothills, are countless spruce towns and folkloric villages, where ancient farm culture survives and cattle still loiter amid flower-filled pastures.  Small, mountainous and wealthy, Switzerland is renowned for its enviable quality of life, with public services ticking along like clockwork. Come for the creamy, complex cheeses, smooth chocolates and luxury watches; stay for the exquisite culture, incredible scenery and sheer sense of fun. 41,284 sq km (15,940 sq miles). 8,588,758 (UN estimate 2019). 208 per sq km. Federal City Bern. Federal republic. Viola Amherd since January 2024.","Neutrality is a key part of the Swiss national identity. While the conflicting forces of the world have squared up to each other time and time again, Switzerland has steered clear of global clashes since it first adopted a neutral stance in 1515. Though peace and stability have characterised the last two centuries, the country’s earlier years were more turbulent. Like most of its southern European neighbours, Switzerland was invaded by the Romans in the 1st century BC. As the Roman Empire began to decline in the 4th and 5th centuries, Germanic and Burgundian tribes arrived, effectively carving up the country between them – a division that is still evident today in the French and German-speaking areas of the nation. Italian and Romansh also developed from regions that spoke Latin dialects. In the 9th century, Switzerland came under the dominion of the Holy Roman Empire, with Charlemagne (The King of the Franks) taking control of the Burgundians and Alemannians.  To begin with, the Swiss were allowed to do mostly as they pleased, but by the 13th century, the Romans had tightened the reins. Resentment soon bubbled among the population, culminating in the founding of the autonomous Swiss Confederation (of three cantons) in 1291. The country was recognized as de-facto independent, under the Treaty of Basel in the late 15th century following the conclusion of the Swabian War and was replaced by a sovereign government in the late 19th century, relying on a democratic system. A new constitution in 1848 enforced that the central government would take on many of the past duties of the cantons, gave citizens new freedoms and allowed for Swiss economic expansion. Nowadays, Switzerland is one of the world’s major financial hubs, with a flourishing banking industry. Despite being surrounded by EU states, Switzerland itself is not a member, with the independent-minded citizens rejecting accession in a 2001 referendum. It wasn’t the first time the Swiss refused to go with the herd; nine years earlier, membership of the European Economic Area was also rejected by referendum. Switzerland did, however, join the United Nations in 2002, and relations with the EU are now based on a wide range of bilateral agreements. As a result of a popular vote, Switzerland joined the Schengen treaty and Dublin Convention in 2005, bringing the country into Europe's passport-free zone. In 2014, the Swiss voted to curb mass immigration with quotas in an initiative presented by the populist Swiss People’s Party, a move that would violate the country’s prior agreement with the EU regarding the free movement of persons. The government opposed this move to curb immigration in 2018 as it a yes vote would drastically impact the country’s trade market, and the referendum has not yet taken place. Did you know? • Women weren’t given the right to vote until 1971. • In Switzerland, it’s against the law to keep a lone guinea pig; these sociable rodents must have a companion. • Switzerland has enough nuclear bunkers to shelter every citizen.

It is customary to give flowers to the hostess when invited for a meal, but never give chrysanthemums or white asters as they are considered funeral flowers. Informal wear is widely acceptable. First-class restaurants, hotel dining rooms and important social occasions may warrant jackets and ties. Black tie is usually specified when required. German (63.5% of the population) in central and eastern areas, French (22.5%) in the west and Italian (8.1%) in the south.

The North Atlantic Drift brings mild weather and mixes with dry air from the North Arctic to cause great temperature changes and fluxing rain patterns. That being said, weather is generally never unreasonably humid, too hot or too cold. More precipitation comes down in mountainous regions with higher altitudes, whether rain or snow.  Climatic conditions vary through Switzerland’s four seasons year-round. Many tourists come to Switzerland for winter activities (December-February), particularly the Alps around Christmas time and the New Year, which coincides with the country’s coldest, snowiest weather. January and February’s temperatures range from the low -2°C (28°F) to a more moderate 7°C (45°F). However, warmer spring (March-May), summer (June-August) and autumn (September-November) conditions are more clement and therefore receive plenty of fanfare. Sunny days in Switzerland are perfect for admiring views of its picturesque greenery and are ideal for sightseeing whether you hike, bike or boat. A hot summer’s highest temperature can even surpass 30°C (86°F).  Zurich, in the north, is the largest city in Switzerland. It has a temperate climate with winters that call for thick jackets and woollen scarves, as average temperatures typically fall below 5°C (41°F). Precipitation is not uncommon throughout the year, but April and May are the rainiest months and give way to June thunderstorms. With a bustling art scene and plenty of nightlife, finding a good time indoors in Zurich is not difficult.  Geneva, which touches France on the eastern edge of Switzerland, has average winter temperatures of 10°C (50°F) and summers of 23°C (73°C) making all seasons great options for visiting the Jet d’Eau fountain or roaming through the old town with views of the Jura mountains.  Dipping into Italy on the southern tip of Switzerland, Ticino has a temperate, pleasant climate at any given time. It has much sunnier weather and almost halves the national cloud coverage average with clear, unblemished skies. Some even call Mendrisio, the region on the southern end of Ticino, the “Tuscany of Switzerland,” making it the go-to destination for classic Swiss greenery with a Mediterranean flare.  Bern, the capital of Switzerland, mixes the country’s temperate climates with ideal skiing conditions in the Bernese Oberlands. Summer visitors should pack an umbrella as June through August is Bern’s rainiest period. Temperatures can also dip to lows near 0°C (32°F) in the winter, so those venturing to the mountains will want to wear a thick coat to brave typically unpredictable Swiss weather. In winter, pack warm clothes and rainwear. Those planning on hiking in the Alps should remember hiking boots, waterproof layers, hats and coats. Lightweight jackets and clothes are recommended for summer; though still do bring an umbrella in case Switzerland’s varied weather strikes. Landlocked Switzerland shares borders with France to the west, Germany to the north, Austria and Liechtenstein to the east and Italy to the south. It has some of the highest mountains in Europe, together with waterfalls, rivers and lakes set amid green pastures. The highest peaks are Dufourspitze, 4,634m (15,203ft), on the Italian border; the Dom, 4,545m (14,911ft); the Matterhorn, 4,478m (14,691ft); and the Weisshorn, 4,506m (14,783ft)."
europe,spain,"Tenerife is undergoing something of a metamorphosis. Long synonymous with crass commercialism, the island has been pursuing a more discerning clientele in a bid to confine its pies, fries, and beer image to the history books. Offering a closer and cost-effective alternative to the Caribbean, its verdant peaks and sandy shores are indeed attracting more refined pilgrims; those who come in search of sun and solace, rather than cheap booze and casual sex. The hotel scene is changing, too. Once dominated by pile-them-high-and-sell-them-cheap apartments, the island’s accommodation offering has been enhanced by luxury resorts, where guests can practice yoga on manicured beaches, tee-off overlooking the Atlantic or go horse riding in the surf. In line with its image change, Tenerife's gastronomic scene is also experiencing a revolution. Promenades still tempt sunbathers with all day British breakfasts and cheap beer, but in hotel dining rooms and chic restaurants a culinary movement is gathering pace. The island's excellent wines are also finding a new faithful amongst the tippling cognoscenti of Europe. Tenerife, the largest and most populous of the Canary Islands, was formed in the aftermath of a mighty volcanic eruption. Mount Teide is a reminder of its fiery past, looming large over the island.  A UNESCO World Heritage Site, Teide is the third largest volcano in the world and, while she sleeps a deep slumber, she remains active. During the winter her obsidian flanks turn white with snow and in spring her dark surface is streaked scarlet by the dazzling spikes of tajinaste plants. Mother Nature's less explosive contributions include the mountain rainforests of Anaga; the sandy beaches of El Medano; and the vertiginous cliffs of Los Gigantes in the wild west. Bathed in year-round sunshine and possessing an impressive diversity of landscapes and micro climates, visitors to Tenerife can go from snowboarding to surfing in the space of a few hours and still have time to sip fine wine over a scarlet sunset and stargaze in some of the world's clearest skies. 2,034 sq km (785 sq miles). 888,184 (2015). 436.7 per sq km. Santa Cruz de Tenerife.","Although territorially belonging to Spain, Tenerife and the Canary Islands have many similarities to the Americas. Before their invasion by the Spanish in the 15th century, the islands were populated by a race of fishermen and farmers probably related to the North African Berbers. The new settlers quickly planted sugarcane which thrived in the tropical climate of the north of Tenerife and soon brought financial rewards. A near-perfect climate, an alluring landscape and the prospect of new horizons attracted merchants, artisans and holy orders in their droves. In the 17th century, when the sugar trade was undercut by cheaper production in the Antilles, vines were planted and Tenerife's Malmsey wine became the best in the world. Strategically placed at the crossroads between Europe and the New World, Tenerife became a frontier land, grown rich with the spoils of trade and a constant target for every brigand, pirate and navy man working in the Atlantic Ocean, including one Admiral Nelson who lost his arm during an unsuccessful attempt on the capital in 1797. But when market forces drove crops into decline and hunger followed, it was to the new American colonies that much of the population fled, seeking work and an escape from hunger. It was Tinerfeños (natives of Tenerife) who, in the 19th century, founded the cities of Montevideo in Uruguay and San Antonio in Texas. Others fled to Cuba and Argentina, returning to their homeland once they’d made their fortunes. In the late 19th century banana production was introduced to Tenerife and remains the largest single food export, its giant leaves adorning plantations across the island. In economic terms, however, agriculture has long since played second fiddle to the new cash crop of tourism. In 1936 when a commander-in-chief of the Spanish army was suspected of plotting to overthrow the government, he was posted to Tenerife as Governor of the Canary Islands to keep him out of the way. The plan didn't work, and it was from here that General Francisco Franco launched his offensive that began the Spanish Civil War. Did you know? • As part of his annual salary, William Shakespeare was paid with one barrel of wine from Tenerife. • The whodunnit writer Agatha Christie wrote much of The Mystery on the Blue Train while holidaying in Tenerife. • Queen’s hit song Tie Your Mother Down was written by Brian May while he was studying astronomy in Tenerife. There is no official religion, but the majority of the population is Roman Catholic. Spanish life has undergone rapid change in recent decades and many of the stricter religious customs are giving way to modernity, particularly in the cities and among women. In spite of this, traditions remain strong; hospitality, chivalry and courtesy thrive. Handshaking is the customary form of greeting between men, while women to whom one has already been introduced may be greeted with a fleeting kiss to either cheek. Normal social courtesies should be observed when visiting someone's home and a small gift is always appreciated. Conservative casual wear is widely acceptable. The evening meal is taken late, generally 2100-2200. Smoking has long been banned in offices, shops, schools, hospitals, cultural centres and on public transport, but in 2011 that ban was extended to all bars, cafes and restaurants. Spain now has one of the toughest anti-smoking laws in Europe.  The principal language is Spanish.","Tenerife has a relatively stable climate throughout the year with average daytime temperatures varying between 15°C (59°F) and 25°C (77°F). August is generally the hottest month, January and February the coolest, during which time snow can appear on the highest ground. The north of the island tends to be a little cooler with more chance of cloudy days. Lightweight except in winter when the evenings can be cool. Warm clothing is required for visiting the mountain areas in winter. Tenerife is the largest of the seven Canary Islands and lies in the Atlantic Ocean approximately 320km (200 miles) off the border between Morocco and Western Sahara, and 1,300km (812 miles) from the Iberian Peninsula. At its centre is Mount Teide, the highest point in Spain at 3,718m (12,198ft)."
europe,turkey,"For sheer diversity, Turkey (officially the Republic of Türkiye) is hard to beat. The country is best measured in multitudes – of people, natural landscapes and cultures. It is a land of vast open spaces and massive mountain ranges, fertile valleys and rugged coastline, fast-growing cities and sleepy villages, seaside resorts and remote beaches. Countless waves of invasion, rebellion and immigration have forged a country whose cultural depth and breadth may surprise visitors as they venture not just through major cities, but across the country. Turkey overflows with historic sites and archaeological wonders, all set in a varied and beautiful landscape. The Mediterranean coastline is punctuated with well-preserved Greco-Roman cities like Pergamom and Ephesus, while the otherworldly landscapes of the Cappadocia region harbour cave churches and underground cities. Though capital status eludes it, Istanbul is very much the beating heart of the nation. The city is an archive of cultural influences throughout the centuries, playing host to Roman aqueducts, Byzantine churches and Ottoman mosques and palaces. Yet it’s no relic. Cafes, bustling bazaars, hammams (public baths), and nightclubs all buzz with activity. Still, Istanbul is just one piece of the vast Turkish puzzle. Beach-lovers can while away lazy sunny days at the ever-popular Bodrum, Marmaris and Izmir resorts along Turkey’s Aegean and Mediterranean coasts. The unlikely capital city, Ankara, may be less frequented, but its location in central Anatolia makes it worthy of a few days’ visit, if only to witness the contrast between the city’s modernity and the surviving citadel. Away from the more European sensibilities of Istanbul, Ankara also presents an opportunity to gain insight into other facets of Turkish culture. However deep its roots are, Turkey is today a thrusting and dynamic society, navigating cultural, economic and political change while seeking to retain the best of its multicultural heritage and time-honoured traditions. And that's arguably what makes it so rewarding.  783,562 sq km (302,535 sq miles). 79,622,062 (UN estimate 2016). 101.4 per sq km. Ankara. Presidential system. President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan since 2014.","Turkey is a relatively stable, secular democracy that remains broadly pro-Western, seeking to eventually become part of European Union. However, its recent past is more turbulent. Defeat in the Balkan Wars of 1912-13 and World War 1 led to the collapse of the Ottoman Empire, the subsequent declaration by President Kemal Ataturk, of a secular Turkish Republic, and the ‘exchange of populations’, when more than a million ethnic Greeks left Turkey for Greece, while around half a million Turkish Muslims returned to Turkey. Turkey remained neutral during World War 2, but in the post-war years the army intervened several times to overthrow governments of which it disapproved. In 1974, Turkey and Greece came close to war over Cyprus, and the issue remains the biggest obstacle to Turkey joining the EU, with the country divided along the Green Line – the north is Turk-Cypriot, whilst the south is Greek-Cypriot. Since the 1960s, Kurdish separatists seeking an independent state in southeast Turkey have clashed with security forces. Turkey’s history stretches back more than 5000 years. Asia Minor cradled the Hittite kingdom, from around 2200 BC, ancient Troy and the Greek city-states, which rose along the coasts during the first millennium BC. Their struggle with the Persian Empire ended with its conquest by Alexander the Great whose own empire broke up after his death and by 2BC the region had been conquered by Rome. Relics such as the Temple of Diana at Ephesus and the Roman theatres at Aspendos and Side are among the great sights of present-day Turkey. In AD330, Emperor Constantine I moved the Roman capital to Byzantium, strategically located on the Bosphorus, renamed it Constantinople and imposed Christianity on the Empire. The Seljuk Turks trickled into Anatolia (eastern Turkey) and were followed by the Ottoman Turks. In 1453 Constantinople fell to Sultan Mehmet II. His successors expanded the Ottoman Empire further, and at its apogee, they held sway over a territory that stretched from the Balkans to the Red Sea and the Nile. With recent uprisings in the Middle East, including the 2011 Arab Spring and Syria’s civil war, Turkey’s stability now finds itself under threat. Most recently, the heavy-handed quashing of demonstrations in Istanbul and Ankara against the authoritarian style of the police under Prime Minister Erdoğan’s government has brought international condemnation. An attempted coup in July 2016 failed to gain public support and was followed by a decisive crackdown on the civil service and Erdoğan’s opponents. In 2017, a referendum was narrowly passed in favour of the winner of the 2019 election assuming full control of government, thus ending the country's parliamentary political system and strengthening Erdoğan’s grip on power. The three largest cities, Istanbul, Ankara and Izmir voted against these measures, and the opposition party intends to challenge the results. Did you know? • Turkish coffee is on the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage list for Turkey. • Since Ottoman times Turkey’s national sport has been Yağlı güreş, oiled wrestling. • As many as 99.8 per cent of Turks are Muslim.

Shaking hands is the normal form of greeting a stranger;  kissing on the cheek is reserved for meeting friends and family. Hospitality is very important and visitors should respect Islamic customs. Informal wear is acceptable, but beachwear should be confined to the beach or poolside. Smoking is widely acceptable but prohibited in cinemas, theatres, buses, coaches and dolmuş (collective taxis). Until recently women working in civil service or government roles, or studying in university, were banned from wearing headscarves. This ban was lifted in 2013, but the subject remains a contentious issue. However, if visiting a mosque, women are advised to take scarves to cover their hair and to wear long-sleeved tops. Both men and women should have legs covered from the knees upwards. Turkish is the official language. Kurdish is also spoken by a minority in the southeast. French, German and English are widely spoken in major cities and tourist areas.","Turkey is a huge country, and its climate varies widely from region to region as well as seasonally. For sightseeing holidays to Istanbul and the most important ancient and medieval sights, and for active walking holidays, the best times to visit are spring (April-May) and autumn (October-early November) when days are generally warm and sunny but not uncomfortably hot. Rainy spells and cloudy days are possible, however, in spring and autumn, so the best months for a sun-and-sea holiday on the Aegean or Mediterranean coast are June to end September. Resort areas are most crowded from June until the end of August. In developing ski areas such as Uludag near Bursa and Palandoken near Erzurum, the best time to visit is between December and April. Temperatures in and around Istanbul can vary from well below freezing in midwinter to above 40°C (104°F) in summer. The Aegean and Mediterranean coasts experience the hottest summers, with highs of 45°C (113°F), but midwinter temperatures can be as low as -5°C (23°F). Mountainous Eastern Turkey has the most extreme climate of all, with winter temperatures as low as -43°C (-45F) and highs up to 38C (100F). The climate of the central Anatolia is also extreme with summer highs of 40°C (104°F) and winter lows of -25°C (-13°F). The Turkish State Meteorological Office (www.mgm.gov.tr) provides a day to day, region by region online weather forecast. Depending on where you are, appropriate clothing will vary widely. If visiting during the summer take light cotton layers and a hat, as temperatures can reach scorching, particularly in the cities. During the winter months pack heavier layers and waterproofs. Sturdy shoes and equipment are advisable for anyone who will be trekking in the mountainous areas. Turkey borders the Black Sea, Georgia and Armenia to the northeast, Iran to the east, Iraq to the southeast, Syria and the Mediterranean to the south, the Aegean Sea to the west and Greece and Bulgaria to the northwest. Asia Minor (or Anatolia) is the name given to the peninsula that forms a bridge between Europe and Asia. It accounts for 97% of the country's area and forms a long, wide peninsula 1,650km (1,025 miles) from east to west and 650km (400 miles) from north to south. The biggest city is Ankara, which is situated in the central plains of Anatolia. The other 3% of the country is Thrace, the tiny land mass which is the European portion of Turkey bordering Bulgaria and Greece and separated from Anatolia by the Bosphorus, a strait linking the Black Sea and Aegean Sea. Despite its small size 10% of the population lives here, with most of these in Istanbul. Two east-west mountain ranges, the Black Sea Mountains in the north and the Taurus in the south, enclose the central Anatolian plateau, but converge in a vast mountainous region in the far east of the country. It is here that the ancient Tigris and Euphrates rivers rise."
europe,ukraine,"Vast and mysterious to many, Ukraine is barely known to outsiders despite being one of the largest countries in Europe. Long-associated with its colossal neighbour Russia, it's a country that stands out in its own right for its varied landscapes and surprising cultural diversity. To the majority of those visiting for the first time, the reputation of Ukraine's hardy inhabitants can seem formidable. But while, much like in neighbouring Russia, cracking a smile at a stranger in the street is deemed a sure sign of madness, locals tend to be a thoroughly welcoming lot once you've broken the ice. Before long they'll be showing you round the sights and inviting you to their home for a steaming borscht – the country's iconic beetroot soup. Ukraine's natural side is also seen as tough – and it's true that in winter snow covers most of the land as temperatures plummet. During the rest of the year, though, it's surprisingly clement. What's more, with its largely unspoilt, verdant interior, Ukraine is ideal for hikers and cyclists. The Carpathian Mountains that spill over the border with Poland, Hungary and Romania dominate the west of the country while flat plains carpeted with sunflowers and cereals make up much of the central and eastern region. To the south are the almost Mediterranean-like Black Sea coast and the Crimean Peninsula, which remains a huge draw for holidaymakers every summer. And even when snow falls through the winter, the landscape is beautiful, while there are many old churches and Soviet-era buildings to dive into for shelter.Ukraine's capital, Kiev, founded in the eighth century, displays a heady mix of architecture befitting of a city that was once capital of Kievan Rus, the precursor of the modern Russian state. A wealth of baroque and Renaissance architecture can also be found in Lviv, one of Europe's oldest cities, while Odessa is probably best known for the Potemkin Stairway that featured in Sergei Eisenstein's epic film The Battleship Potemkin. Recently, Ukraine has been in the news for the wrong reasons due to Russian separatism on the border. Despite this, most of the country is completely safe for visitors. 603,700 sq km (233,090 sq miles). 42,418,235 (2017). 73.6 per sq km. Kiev. Republic. President Wolodymyr Selenskyj since 2019.

By the 19th century, although the western part of Ukraine was under Austro-Hungarian control, most of the country became part of the Russian Empire. After various attempts at independence around the period of the 1917 Russian Revolution, Ukraine became a republic within the USSR and its territory enlarged slightly around the time of World War II. Crimea became part of Ukraine in 1954 and, due to its predominantly Russian population and strategic position on the Black Sea, is still the subject of on-going dispute between Ukraine and Russia especially since the 2014 annexation of Crimea by Russia. In 1986, in the final years of the Soviet era and during the Perestroika period of President Gorbachev, the accident at the Chernobyl nuclear plant in northern Ukraine brought worldwide attention and was arguably a significant factor in accelerating the collapse of the Soviet Union. Full independence came with the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991, but Ukraine’s foreign relations are still dominated by the Russian Federation, a fact which displeases many of the country’s ethnic Ukrainian population, particularly those in the west of the country. Rigged presidential elections in 2004 that declared Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovych the victor sparked bitter public outcry and resulted in the so-called Orange Revolution and the subsequent 2005 election of pro-Western Viktor Yushchenko as President, with Yulia Tymoshenko as his Prime Minister. However, Yanukovych soon returned to power as Prime Minister in 2006 and in 2010 was elected President once more. Ousted by Parliament in 2014, he fled the country and according to some reports was granted Russian citizenship in a ‘secret decree’ by Vladimir Putin. In January 2015 he was placed on Interpol’s wanted list. The current President Petro Poroshenki was elected by an outright majority in 2014 and in 2016 took Ukraine into the Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area with the EU in an attempt to modernise and develop its economy, political structure and rule of law by gradually increasing its connection to the EU’s internal market. Did you know? • The National Police Force of Ukraine was formed on 3 July 2015 to replace the discredited and unpopular Militsiya. • The University of Lviv, founded in 1661, is the oldest in Ukraine. • Traditional Ukrainian Easter eggs, known as pysanky, are thought to be at least 1,000 years old and pre-date the Christian era. About 16% of Ukraine’s population claim to be either not religious or do not identify with a particular church. Around 55% are members of the Eastern Orthodox Church while 6.5%, mostly in western Ukraine, adhere to the Uniate (Eastern-rite) or Ukrainian Greek Catholic tradition. Other minorities include the Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church, the Roman Catholic Church and various Protestant groups. There is also a Muslim minority (mainly consisting of Tatars in Crimea), which makes up 1.1% of the population. Ukrainian people are generally warm and friendly to visitors. It is not at all uncommon for Ukrainians to invite strangers into their own homes. Shoes should be removed on entering a home. Formal attire is rarely required, though people dress smartly for the theatre. Visitors should avoid ostentatious displays of wealth in public places. Men should not shake a woman’s hand unless it is offered to them. Women should cover their heads when entering a church or mosque. Ukrainian is the sole official state language. It is still widely spoken in western and central Ukraine, although Russian is spoken by virtually everyone. Russian is the main language spoken in Kiev, eastern Ukraine and Crimea.","Ukraine has a temperate continental climate with cold, snowy winters and warm summers. Summer is generally the best time to visit (between June and September), although it can occasionally be uncomfortably hot and many hotels do not have air conditioning. July and August are peak holiday months in Crimea and its resorts can become crowded with domestic and Russian tourists. Spring and autumn are both fairly short and both tend to be reasonably mild. The best season for trekking in the Carpathian Mountains is May and October when it is driest. The northeast of Ukraine has the coldest winters and the Crimean peninsula has the warmest temperatures. The wettest part of Ukraine is the Carpathian Mountains region of the far west. Lightweight clothes needed in summer, light- to mediumweight in the spring and autumn and heavyweight in the winter. Ukraine is bordered by the Russian Federation to the north and east; Belarus to the north; Poland, the Slovak Republic and Hungary to the west; and Romania and Moldova to the southwest. It is a varied country with mountains in the west, plains in the centre and the Black Sea views to the south. The north of the state is dominated by forests. Its other two main features are wooded steppe with beech and oak forests and the treeless steppe. The River Dnieper divides Ukraine roughly in half, and flows into the Black Sea."
europe,united-kingdom,"Few places cram in as much scenery, history and culture as the United Kingdom. It’s a busy, eccentric and unique destination; a land of daft humour, tea-and-cake clichés and a thousand and one different personalities; a land where thrusting cities like London, Glasgow and Manchester share map space with the peaks of Snowdonia and the colossal slopes of the Highlands. Four component nations make up the UK, and the end result is as many-layered as that fact would suggest. Its arts scene continues to be one of the most creative and successful in the world, its passions still run high on everything from politics to sport and its overall character is as modern as it is multicultural. Even the food’s good these days. London remains the natural focal point. Its skyline, mixing medieval turrets with soaring steel, is a good marker for the place as a whole. From its markets to its museums, its pubs to its palaces, it’s a bona fide world city packed with diversity. But you don’t have to look far to find other great urban centres – England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are all home to richly engaging cities full of heritage, music and nightlife. Some, like Bath and Edinburgh, offer postcard-perfect medieval skylines. Others, like Belfast and Liverpool, are handsome in places but just as notable for their indelible personalities. As a country, of course, the UK’s urban centres are just one part of its allure. Britain is often extremely beautiful. Seaside towns, national parks and honey-stoned villages still fill the guidebooks, and the scenic pull of areas like the Cornish coast, Giant’s Causeway and the Lake District is as strong as it’s ever been. Once you factor in the endless cultural associations that Britain throws up – from Henry VIII to Hogwarts, The Beatles to Braveheart, male voice choirs to Monty Python – it stands as a country very much its own. 242,514 sq km (93,635 sq miles). 65,111,143 (UN estimate 2016). 266.4 per sq km.

The Romans occupied Britain from AD 43 to AD 410 and left behind straight roads, a sewage system and hot baths, amongst other things. After that the Romans, Jutes, Saxons and Angles all established kingdoms south of Hadrian's Wall before the Normans arrived and gave rise to the myth that it was the last time England was invaded. It wasn’t. England was subsequently invaded several times by the French, a few times by the Scots, at various intervals by pretenders to the throne and once by the Dutch. The Spanish and the Germans also had a go but neither actually set foot on dry land. King Henry VIII is not only famous for having six wives, but also for breaking away from the Church of Rome, setting up the Church of England so he could get divorced. After Henry, battles between monarchs, nations, nobles and sections of the population invariably became tussles about how to run the country, culminating in the English Civil War (1642-1651), which was won by the Parliamentarians. The constitutional monarchy that exists in the United Kingdom today developed during the 18th and 19th centuries as power came to be increasingly exercised by an elected parliament. In 1801 Great Britain – that’s England, Wales and Scotland – were formally united with Ireland. The subsequent reign of Queen Victoria, whose role was now little more than symbolic, coincided with a period of great economic success and unfettered empire building before events of the 20th century, notably two world wars, resulted in the dismantling of the empire. In 1920, Ireland gained independence from the United Kingdom, leaving behind Northern Ireland, whose troubled relationship with the UK led to an ethno-nationalist conflict better known as The Troubles (1968-1998). World wars and internal conflicts led to social upheaval, which resulted in universal suffrage, the Welfare State, the repeal of the death penalty and the legalisation of homosexuality. In 2014 Scotland held a referendum to determine whether it would continue being part of the United Kingdom or not. It voted to stay – just – but calls for independence can still be heard across the land.

Handshaking is customary when introduced to someone for the first time. One or two kisses on the cheek is gaining popularity for close friends. Normal social courtesies should be observed when visiting someone's home and a small present such as flowers or chocolates is appreciated. It is polite to wait until everyone has been served before eating. Some nightclubs and restaurants do not allow jeans and trainers, otherwise casual wear is widely acceptable. For business, a suit and tie should be worn, although in some workplaces an open neck is acceptable. Topless sunbathing is allowed on certain beaches and tolerated in some parks. Smoking is banned in all enclosed public places, including stations, pubs and restaurants, throughout the UK. The monarchy, though now only symbolic politically, is a powerful and often subconscious unifying force. Members of the Royal Family are the subject of unceasing fascination, with their every move avidly followed and reported by the popular press, both in the UK and abroad. The main language is English, but Welsh is spoken in parts of Wales, and Gaelic in parts of Scotland. The many ethnic minorities within the UK also speak their own languages (eg Cantonese, Greek, Hindi, Mandarin, Turkish, Urdu, etc).","There is never a bad time to visit the United Kingdom, but for the most reliable weather come during the summer months (June-August) when the days are long and warm. Temperatures have been known on occasion to nudge 30°C (86°F), sometimes higher, but the threat of rain is ever present - pack waterproofs as well as the sunscreen. The southeast of England is generally sunnier and warmer than the rest of the United Kingdom, but resorts along the coast get crowded during the summer. The United Kingdom is arguably at its most beautiful during the autumn months (September-November), when rural landscapes take on brown, red and pink hues as the leaves lose their pigment. Scotland and the north of England bear the brunt of winter (November-March), but snow occasionally blankets much of the United Kingdom bringing with it travel chaos. The mercury has been known to dip to -10°C (14°F), but those kind of temperatures are rare. Waterproofing throughout the year. Warm clothing is advisable at all times, and is essential for any visits to upland areas. The British landscape can be divided roughly into two kinds of terrain - highland and lowland. The highland area comprises the mountainous regions of Scotland, Northern Ireland, northern England and North Wales. The English Lake District in the northwest contains lakes and fells. The lowland area is broken up by sandstone and limestone hills, long valleys and basins such as the Wash on the east coast. In the southeast, the North and South Downs culminate in the White Cliffs of Dover. The coastline includes fjord-like inlets in the northwest of Scotland, spectacular cliffs and wild sandy beaches on the east coast and, further south, beaches of rock, shale and sand sometimes backed by dunes, and large areas of fenland in East Anglia. Note: The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland consists of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Although they form one administrative unit (with regional exceptions), they have had separate cultures, languages and political histories. The United Kingdom section consists of a general introduction (covering the aspects that the four countries have in common) and sections devoted to the four constituent countries. The Channel Islands (Alderney, Guernsey, Jersey, Sark and Herm) and the Isle of Man are dependencies of the British Crown. These are included here for convenience of reference.

europe,vatican-city,"The Vatican City is the world's smallest sovereign state and is situated entirely within the city of Rome. Many visitors come for religious reasons, but you don’t have to be a Catholic to appreciate this extraordinary destination. Famed sights include the colossal monument to Catholicism that is St Peter’s Basilica and the Vatican Palace, where the Pope resides. Inside his lavish abode lies the legendary Sistine Chapel, which lays claim to the most famous ceiling in the world. Crane your head to marvel at Michelangelo’s magnum opus, The Last Judgement. Crowds can make a visit to Vatican City a bit of a trial – it’s busy throughout the year and at most times of day – but putting up with swathes of tourists seems like a small price to pay to bask in the state’s assorted treasures. Join the queues and follow the masses through the Vatican Museums to see an astonishing collection of paintings by the likes of Raphael and Giotto in the Pinacoteca Vaticana. You’ll also find extraordinary artefacts from classical antiquity, as well as museums dedicated to older finds from the Etruscans and Egyptians. As leader of the Papal States for more than 1,000 years until Italian Unification in the 19th century, the Vatican has a long and uneven history. But the new Argentinian pope, formerly known as Jorge Mario Bergoglio, has breathed new life into the old office since his appointment in 2013. As a result, visitors from far and wide have been flocking in ever-greater numbers to catch a glimpse of the new Roman Catholic leader and the city he lives in. Pope Francis is known to give a general audience on Wednesdays, either in Audience Hall or St Peter’s Square. On Sundays, he usually gives a midday blessing from the window of his office, which overlooks the square. 0.44 sq km (0.17 sq miles). 801 (UN estimate 2016). 1,818.2 per sq km.

Pope Francis since 2013.","For over 1,000 years – from the era of Charlemagne's Frankish empire until 1870 – much of the central Italian peninsula was under the direct or indirect rule of the Pope, who, at the same time, wielded immense power throughout the whole of Europe. The Papacy was often deeply involved in the political issues of the times and the office itself was frequently controlled by powerful lay rulers. It was only in the 16th century with the coming of the Reformation that the Pope's spiritual dominance of Europe came to an end. In 1978, Cardinal Karol Wojtyla became the first non-Italian incumbent of the Papacy since the 16th century, taking the title of John Paul II. During his pontificate, the Vatican experienced a major administrative upheaval and was embroiled in a massive financial scandal. Following the death of Pope John Paul II in 2005, the successor to Pope John Paul's much-lauded reign was signalled by the traditional blowing of white smoke out of a chimney fixed to the roof of the Sistine Chapel. Head of the Roman Catholic Church until recently was the German-born Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, who named himself Pope Benedict XVI. Many Catholics and the worldwide press were divided in opinion over Pope Benedict XVI's ultra-conservative past as Cardinal, with his frequent hard-line denouncements of issues such as relativism, homosexuality, birth control and the inauguration of women in the Catholic church. The church's image did not improve much under the German Pope, and in 2013, Benedict XVI made the surprise decision to resign. He was succeeded by Argentina's Pope Francis. The new Pope has sought to rebuild the Vatican's image, regularly speaking out on issues of social justice, softening the church's stance in some areas, promoting inter-faith dialogue, and declining the traditional pomp of the Papacy. Did you know? • Benedict XVI was the first Pope to resign since 1415, and the first to jump without being 'pushed' since 1294. • Spookily, the Vatican City stands upon an ancient Roman necropolis. • Many early Christians are thought to have been martyred at the foot of the Vatican Hill by the infamous Roman Emperor Caligula. Italian and Latin are the official languages, though most international languages are spoken to some extent.","The best time to visit Vatican City is during the months of April, May, September and October, when there are less crowds and the days are long and sunny, but without the heat and humidity of July and August. The Vatican City is situated entirely within the city of Rome, sprawling over a hill west of the River Tiber, and separated from the rest of the city by a wall. Vatican City comprises St Peter's Church, St Peter's Square, the Vatican and the Vatican Gardens."
europe,united-kingdom,"Though Wales forms an integral part of the United Kingdom, it often sits in the shadows of its high-achieving neighbours. But treat Wales as an after thought and you’ll be missing a trick. It may be small, but Wales is resourceful, squeezing in green hills, bustling cities and colourful seaside villages, fronted by UNESCO-listed beaches. Its people are welcoming but passionate, harbouring the spirit of the iconic red dragon that adorns its national flag. Starting at the top, the beautiful island of Anglesey (Wales’s largest island) has shot into the limelight recently thanks to the residency of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. But ask any local and they’ll tell you the island has long been revered – some North Walians still consider it to be the true heartland of Wales. Tread carefully. Further down the mainland lies the awe-inspiring Snowdonia National Park, home to Snowdon, Wales’s highest peak, not to mention some of the best hiking trails in the British Isles. The restaurant at the summit offers album-worthy panoramas and is arguably the best spot in the country to sample Welsh oggie (a lamb and leek pasty). To claim that the journey to the south of the country transcends time from traditional to modern Wales is overly dramatic, but there is a wisp of truth in this remark. Sleepy villages give way to modern cities and the national tongue, for the most part, slips from Welsh into English. Here, the cities of Swansea, a stone’s throw from the surfer-strewn sands of the Gower peninsular; Newport, a modern port city emerging from its industrial roots; and Cardiff, the cosmopolitan capital, dominate the landscape and provide ample opportunities for urban adventure. These modern cities have not abandoned their heritage, though; scattered amongst them are museums, medieval castles (Cardiff, Coch and Caerphilly to name a few) and historic sites chronicling the redundant coal mining industry, a big part of the nation’s identity. Granted, it may lack the pulling power of its heavyweight neighbours, but Wales is a country that rewards the adventurous.   20,732 sq km (8,004 sq miles). 3.1 million (2014). 148.8 per sq km.

The Romans, the Saxons and the Normans all eyed up the Welsh countryside and set off across the River Severn to see what they could claim – with mixed results. Today, the rugged castles still dotted around the country stand as testament to attempts by these invaders to keep the locals in check. Welsh historical heroes range from the semi-mythical King Arthur – who is also claimed by the Cornish and who features in ancient Welsh documents as an emperor and war hero – to bona fide legends such as Owain Glyndwr. Also known as Owen Glendower, he featured in Shakespeare's Henry IV and waged violent battles against the English, claiming right to the title Prince of Wales. After winning a series of conflicts and signing an allegiance with France, Glyndwr drew the wrath of the English king, who clamped down on the Welsh, banning substantial gatherings of people and preventing Welshmen from holding office. Glyndwr's period of glory eventually came to an end when the forces of Henry V took back the castles and strongholds the Prince of Wales had gained. Non-conformist religion, particularly in the form of the Baptist and Methodist Churches, marked the rise of Welsh nationalism in the 19th century. The non-conformists broke off from the official state religion (Anglican) and taught the Welsh language at Sunday schools. Even today, the country still has a strong sense of identity and national pride. The industrial revolution in the late 18th and early 19th centuries left a heavy mark on Welsh history, altering the focus of the countryside and its workforce from agriculture onto coalmining and ironwork. The period was also marked by increased immigration into Wales, boosting the population. The University of Wales was established in 1893, and the national library and museum both received their royal charters in 1907. From 1999, an elected Welsh assembly was established in Cardiff, with powers devolved from Westminster. Less positive was the decline of the coalmining industry, which some communities are still reeling from today. The Welsh assembly quickly established an independent frame of mind and has taken a different route from English policies on some issues, most famously free prescriptions and university tuition fees.

The scenery of Mid-Wales includes rich farming valleys, the broad sandy sweep of Cardigan Bay and rolling hill country. North Wales is one of the most popular tourist areas in the British Isles, with many lively coastal resorts.

middle-east,bahrain,"Bahrain means 'Two Seas', a fitting name for an archipelago of 33 islands in the Gulf, which defines itself in relation to the water that surrounds its shallow shores. Those shallows once harboured a precious trade in pearls, the most important in the world until the 19th century. Now the shoreline is increasingly dominated by ambitious developments, such as the twin 50-floor towers of Bahrain's World Trade Centre and the 2,787,000 sq m (30,000,000 sq ft) horseshoe of man-made islands at the southern tip of the country. To those not in the know, Bahrain can seem a formidable place in the heart of the Gulf. But despite being situated just off Saudi Arabia's east coast, it is for the most part a welcoming, open country. Manama is an intriguing capital city, if not quite so glamorous is some of the region's other glittering metropolises. You'll find a decent culinary and artistic circuit, partly buoyed by westerners living here. Expect plenty of craft markets and pottery workshops. For history buffs, Bahrain is the location of ancient Dilmun, home to what was an important semitic civilisation in the Bronze Age; Bahrain was later conquered by Babylonians and Persians. There are a number of ruins, burial mounds and forts to explore. In the middle of Bahrain, not far from where the Formula 1 racetrack now draws the crowds, is the point where in 1932 the Arab world first struck gold – black gold, that is – and oil has been the mainstay of the country ever since. As visitors travel the modest length of Bahrain, they will run into many reminders of this momentous discovery, not least in the relaxed affluence of Bahrain's multicultural residents. Indeed, there are many signs of Arabian style and influence, along with more cosmopolitan vibes. Since 2011, when the Arab Spring swept across the region, Bahrain's fate has been an uncertain one.

Bahrain is perhaps even more famous, however, as the seat of the lost empire of Dilmun, a powerful civilisation whose influence lasted between 3200 and 330 BC. The country’s sweet-water springs attracted traders, who took particular interest in the local pearls, and by the 16th century the country began to be of interest to the big naval powers of Europe. In the early 1500s the Portuguese invaded, leaving not much legacy but the distinctive Qala’at al-Bahrain fort on Bahrain’s northern shore. During the 19th century Bahrain came under the influence of the British in the so-called Trucial system – a series of treaties signed with Britain against piracy. The relationship developed into a protectorate agreement, the modern day result of which is a strong tie between the British and the people of Bahrain. Bahrain regained full independence in 1971 and in 2002, Bahrain became a constitutional monarchy with a fully elected parliament in which both men and women are eligible to vote and stand for office.

middle-east,iran,"Iran ought to be one of the world’s most treasured travel destinations, blessed as it is with extraordinary historical sites, exquisite landscapes and a fascinating culture. But international tensions and a tough domestic regime have prevented that from being the case – it has remained a destination for the intrepid. Things are changing, though. Since the election of a moderate president in 2013 and the gradual thawing of relations with the West, this once out-of-bounds country has started to open up. No one’s pretending that its current leadership can’t be shockingly hard-fisted in matters of civic law. But most foreigners are likely to find their preconceptions shattered. They will find Iranians warm and friendly, keen to practice their English and quick with the tea invites. Rich Persian heritage dating back 3,000 years is evident throughout the country. Historical sights like the ancient ruins of Persepolis and the still-glorious former capital of Isfahan are abundant. Iran has a distinct cultural identity too, with its predominately Shia-Muslim population, which sets it apart from most nations in the Islamic world. Parts of the country are very conservative, but Tehran will strike many visitors as extremely modern. Despite the image perpetuated of religious dogma, in the capital women walk around in skinny jeans and make-up, while couples openly hold hands. There’s a lively café culture and a youth culture comparable to Mediterranean countries. Persian cuisine can be sampled in countless traditional and more contemporary restaurants. Ancient Persia has the potential to attract millions of tourists per year, but it's the modern reforming Iran that could be of as much interest. Flashpoint travel advice should be heeded and tourists still won’t be flocking to the country on a whim. But those who do travel will find street-level Iran to be almost unrecognisable from the Iran making headlines around much of the world. 1,648,195 sq km (636,371 sq miles). 81,801,633 (UN estimate July 2016). 50 per sq km. Tehran. Islamic Republic. Supreme Leader Grand Ayatollah Ali Hosseini Khamenei since 1989. President Ebrahim Raisi since 2021.","The history of Iran is bound up in the rise and often-chaotic fall of successive ruling groups. In the 6th century BC, the first Persian Empire was founded by Cyrus the Great, which was overthrown by Alexander the Great some 200 years later, after which came a long chain of invasions from Arabs, Turks and Mongols, among others. Islam arrived in the 7th century. It wasn’t until the heights of the Safavid dynasty in the late 1500s that the Persian Empire could really be said to have regained greatness. The period was marked by lengthy wars with the Ottomans and opulent buildings, many of them religious, as the Shia form of Islam was cemented in the country. By the 19th century, European influence was beginning to be felt strongly, exacerbated after the discovery of oil in the early 1900s. In the 1970s, the economic mismanagement and secular lifestyle of the ruling Shah was a catalyst for the 1979 popular revolution, spearheaded by Ayatollah Khomenei, and Iran became an Islamic Republic. A lengthy war with Iraq followed after Saddam Hussein sought to capitalise on Iranian instability by suddenly invading, and relations remain complicated between the two countries. Nearly four decades since the revolution, the regime of the Ayatollah endures, and Iran remains a powerful force in the region. For more than a decade, Washington and Tehran were at odds over Iran's suspected development of nuclear weapons, but the very real possibility of war between the two powers rapidly ebbed away when the moderate President Hassan Mahmoud Rouhani was elected in 2013, replacing the more hardline President Ahmadinejad. Since then, a surprising detente has taken place between the US and Iran, with an end to economic sanctions and a groundbreaking treaty over Iran's nuclear programme recently struck. Relations between Iran and a number of other Western powers have also begun to normalise, giving hope that the country can regain its status on the world stage. Did you know? • Neckties were banned in Iran in 1979 after the Islamic revolution. • Iran is thought to have built the earliest known windmills. • In 2013, Iran announced it would put a Persian cat in space. According to the Iranian government, which does not officially recognise the existence of non-religious Iranians, 90-95% of the population associate with the Shia branch of Islam, while 5-10% associate with the Sunni and Sufi branches of Islam. The remaining 0.6% are non-Islamic religious minorities, including Baha’is, Mandeans, Yarsanis, Zoroastrians, Jews, and Christians. Visitors should avoid contentious political subjects in conversation. In general, “liberal” Western influences are discouraged by authorities. Handshaking is customary, but not with members of the opposite sex. It must be remembered that intimate relations between non-Muslim men and Muslim women is illegal, and may incur imprisonment. Iranians are incredibly hospitable and like to entertain. It is customary to be offered tea, and guests are expected to accept hospitality. Dress should generally be conservative and discreet – women should cover their heads in public and wear loose clothing. During Ramadan, smoking, eating and drinking in public are prohibited between sunrise and sunset. Persian (Farsi) and Persian dialects are the most widely spoken language, used by 53% of the population. Turkic and Turkic dialects and Kurdish are also used. Arabic is spoken by 1% in Khuzestan in the southwest, and Turkish in the northwest around Tabriz. English, French and (to a lesser extent) German are spoken by many businesspeople and officials.","The size of Iran means that can temperatures can vary hugely, depending on which corner of the country you find yourself in. Days can be incredibly hot between May and October, particularly in the desert regions and along the Gulf Coast, while the mountain ranges of the north become freezing over winter. Nights can be especially cold. In general terms, major cities like Tehran, Esfahan and Tabriz have seasons broadly equivalent to those in Mediterranean Europe. Iran has a relatively low rainfall, but is prone to earthquakes. Those travellers hoping to ski will find most action between November and March, while it’s advisable for all visitors to look into timings of festivals like Ramadan before booking a trip. In Tehran, lightweight clothing is worn from April to October while mediumweights are advised from November to March. Be reminded, however, that dress should always err on the side of conservatism, particularly for women – the wearing of headscarves is obligatory in public. Tropical attire is worn from April to October. Mediumweights are advised from November to March. Iran is located in the Middle East, bordered to the north by Turkmenistan, Azerbaijan, Armenia and the Caspian Sea, the east by Afghanistan and Pakistan, the south by the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman, and the west by Iraq and Turkey. The centre and east of the country are largely barren undulating desert, punctured by qanats (irrigation canals) and green oases, but there are mountainous regions in the west along the Turkish and Iraqi borders and in the north where the Elburz Mountains rise steeply from a fertile belt around the Caspian Sea."
middle-east,iraq,"Iraq may be synonymous with strife, a land of dusty, dubious conflicts, but what you don’t see in the mainstream media are the country’s many attributes: its fantastic birdlife, shimmering oases, turquoise rivers, fertile valleys, UNESCO World Heritage Sites and stunning cityscapes. Some of the world’s oldest societies came out of this ancient land and many refer to the region as the ‘cradle of civilisation.’ But despite its glorious past, the country has little to celebrate at present. Most of Iraq’s political, social, physical and economic infrastructures were destroyed by the US-led invasion in 2003. Successful elections and the withdrawal of troops in 2009 seemed to herald Iraq’s road to recovery and there were reasons to be optimistic: despite continuing violence, tourism had climbed back up to an impressive two million people a year by 2013 and plans were afoot to increase that number threefold. The government even announced that it would restore the Arch of Ctesiphon, the world’s biggest arch made of bricks, and what remains of the ancient Persian capital of the same name. Also revealed were plans to repair the damage done to the southern marshes, which Sadam Hussein drained, and use its status as a bird haven to create a centre for eco-tourism. Since 2013, though, the security situation has rapidly deteriorated, culminating with the Islamic militant group ISIS seizing large swathes of territory in the north in 2014. The Iraqi government has since pushed back against the insurgency, but the situation remains highly volatile with no end in sight. Despite government warnings to avoid travelling to the country, a few adventure tour companies are still taking small groups to Iraq, albeit not the north. If and when the country finally stabilises, there’s little doubt that tourists will return in greater numbers to the ‘cradle of civilisation’. But until then, travel to Iraq is strongly advised against. 438,317 sq km (169,235 sq miles). 37,547,686 (UN estimate 2016). 89 per km2 Baghdad. Democratic republic.

Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi since May 2020.","Mesopotamia – the core of modern Iraq – was at the heart of the Sumerian, Babylonian and Assyrian empires between the 7th century BC and 100 AD. After brief spells under the rule of the Romans and the Sassanids, Iraq was subject to the Arab conquest in 633 AD. Later, the Arab Caliphate took control of the territory during the late 12th and early 13th centuries before being dislodged by the Mongols. At the end of the 14th century, Iraq was conquered and subsumed into the empire ruled by Timur (also known as Tamerlane). The Turks were the next imperial invaders, ruling from the early 16th century until the collapse of the Ottoman Empire. In 1920, Iraq was placed under a League of Nations mandate administered by the UK, whose forces had occupied most of the country. The country achieved independence in 1932, but British forces intervened once again in 1941 to combat a pro-Nazi coup. In 1958, the ruling Hashemite Dynasty was overthrown by a group of radical army officers inspired by the example of Gamal Abdel Nasser in Egypt, and led by Brigadier Abdul al-Karim Kassem. The new regime failed to consolidate its position, however, and relied on a precarious coalition of forces, which quickly disintegrated. Kassem was killed in 1963 during another coup. In 1968, Iraq's final coup in recent history brought to power the Ba'ath Party. In 1979, after a power struggle within the Ba'ath Party, Vice President Saddam Hussein took over as president and party leader. Saddam's main objectives were to establish his country as the undisputed leader of the Arab world and to overcome the Arabs' two principal enemies in the Middle East: Iran and Israel. With Iran in chaos, he launched a full-scale invasion in 1980. The Iraqis failed to win and the fighting went on until 1988. The Iraqi economy was crippled by the war and had incurred an enormous foreign debt, much of which was owed to neighbouring Kuwait; a dispute over oil reserves provided the pretext for the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990. This led to the Gulf War, after which no-fly zones were established by the US and UK. In 2003, a US-led coalition went to war again in Iraq and, finally ousted Saddam Hussein. Since then, Iraq has struggled to rebuild its economy, as well as a workable democracy. After the eventual departure of US troops in 2011, Iraq became embroiled in Syria's civil war, and the radical-Islamist Daesh has seized huge swathes of the country. The fighting shows little sign of letting up. Did you know? • Iraq in Arabic means ‘the fertile’. • Noak’s ark is believed to have been built in modern-day Iraq. • The traditional music of Iraq, maqam, is based on Arabic poetry. Islam. Muslims make up 95% of the population, with considerably more Shiites than Sunni. Others are Christians who belong to various sects, including Chaldeans, Assyrians, Syrian and Roman Catholics, Orthodox Armenians and Jacobites. Other religious minorities are the Yezidis and the Sabaeans, or Mandeans, who are followers of John the Baptist. Owing to a long and varied history, Iraq is a culturally rich country. Today, traditional Islamic culture predominates, with Koranic law playing an active role in the day-to-day life of the country, and visitors should be careful to respect this and act accordingly. Visitors should always address their hosts by full name and title. Traditional Arab hospitality is followed as a rule, in accordance with religious law. Conservative and discreet dress should be worn in observance of local Islamic laws.Social conventions in Iraqi Kurdistan are more flexible. This northern region of Iraq has been semi-autonomous since 1991. Many women wear western fashions and no headscarves. Photography: There is a need for extreme caution when photographing anything of a sensitive nature. This includes photographs of local people (the Muslim religion does not allow the representation of human or animal images in any form); and, most importantly, any government installations, buildings or indeed anything else that may be considered off-limits to visitors. If in any doubt, do not take a photo. 80% Arabic (official). Other languages spoken include Kurdish, Persian, Chaldean, Assyrian and Armenian. English is quite widely spoken in urban centres.In the northern region known as Iraqi Kurdistan, many people, especially younger Kurds, will speak only Kurdish with no Arabic. Although, English is widely spoken in towns.","Summers are very hot and dry but cooler in the mountains in the north and east. Winters are mild with some rain in central and southern Iraq but cold in the north. Long, loose clothing in natural fabrics is advised for summer months. Medium-weights are advised during the winter. Modest dress is advised, especially for women - upper legs and arms, shoulders and cleavage should be covered. A headscarf can be useful for extra coverage, and is essential for visiting mosques.In Iraqi Kurdistan dress for women is very western; in the towns in the north at least half of the women do not wear headscarves and wear western fashions though this does not include short skirts, shorts or obvious cleavage. Iraq shares borders with Turkey, Iran, the Gulf of Oman, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Jordan and the Syrian Arab Republic. There is also a neutral zone between Iraq and Saudi Arabia administered jointly by the two countries. Iraq's portion covers 3,522 sq km (1,360 sq miles). The country's main topographical features are the two rivers, the Euphrates and the Tigris, which flow from the Turkish and Syrian Arab Republic borders in the north to the Gulf in the south. The northeast is mountainous, while the country in the west is arid desert. The land surrounding the two rivers is fertile plain, but the lack of effective irrigation has resulted in flooding and areas of marshland."
middle-east,israel,"Israel has always been an alluring destination. From biblical times to present day, this slice of holy land in the Middle East has long attracted visitors. It has also attracted turmoil, as Israel has always been a politically sensitive and controversial country. Nevertheless, its appeal for visitors is enormous and the day-to-day issues facing residents have little effect on those coming to appreciate its astounding historic relics, impressive religious sites and exquisite natural beauty. Home to the Mount of Olives, the Sea of Galilee and the ancient port of Jaffa, it's hard to go anywhere in Israel without stumbling upon a place of religious significance. But nothing can compare to the holy city of Jerusalem. Sacred to Jews, Muslims and Christians alike, this ancient metropolis is claimed by both Israel and Palestine and its status remains one of the core issues of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Jerusalem's stunning skyline is a complete contrast to the touchy political landscape, with its beautiful bell towers, striking minarets and the golden dome of the Al-Aqsa Mosque. Split into Arabic, Jewish and Christian quarters, this cultural melting pot translates into a sumptuous culinary scene, as well as a feast for the eyes and experiences. Visually, Tel Aviv seems a world away from Jerusalem. Israel's commercial and political heart is a city of glistening skyscrapers, thronging streets and sandy beaches; of contemporary art galleries, excellent restaurants and hedonistic inhabitants. Quite a contrast, then, to neighbouring Jaffa, a historic port city of sprawling markets, cobbled docks and crumbling city walls. This juxtaposition of old and new is typical in Israel, where ancient cities like Nazareth and Acre exist alongside modern metropolises such as Haifa (home to the Baha'i Gardens) and Eilat (a beach oasis unlike any other). Israel's landscapes are equally diverse. Mountains, deserts and fertile valleys can all be found in this sliver of the Middle East, while the Dead Sea, Red Sea, Sea of Galilee and Mediterranean coastlines offer everything from unique geological spectacles to seaside holiday resorts. If you can read beyond the headlines and see past the politics, you will find a beautiful and beguiling nation quite unlike anywhere else on Earth. 20,770 sq km (8,019 sq miles). 8,955,440 (Israel Central Bureau of Statistics estimate 2018). 406 per sq km Jerusalem. Parliamentary republic President Isaac Herzog since 2021. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu since December 2022.","The Jewish people trace their ancestry to Abraham who settled in the land of Canaan around the 17th century BCE. They controlled much of the area despite clashes with the neighbouring Assyrians and Philistines, until being overrun by Alexander the Great in the fourth century BCE. By 100 CE, Jerusalem was under Roman rule, before it was occupied by Arabs and then retaken during the Christian First Crusade. The Christians established several states, including the Kingdom of Jerusalem, which survived until 1291 when the area fell under the Mamluks and subsequently the Ottoman Empire. The country then experienced a lengthy decline as the Jews spread across Europe, North Africa, the Middle East and, later, the Americas. Most countries today have a community descended from Jewish settlers and most have suffered some form of persecution. As the Ottoman years ended after the British conquest, the country saw great numbers of Jews arriving to create a Jewish homeland. The aspiration of the Zionist Movement to re-establish a separate Jewish nation was recognised by the British government in 1917, following Britain's occupation of Palestine.   A League of Nations mandate entrusted the region to the British, who granted Jews and Arabs the right to run their own affairs, but the British struggled to balance their commitment to the two populations. After World War II the UN favoured the creation of a separate Jewish state in Palestine. The Arabs refused to accept this, but the expiry of the mandate and pressure from Jewish immigrants - many of which had moved to Palestine after the war -forced the British to withdraw. In May 1948, Israel declared independence, sparking the Arab-Israeli War. Israel took control of three-quarters of Palestine, leaving the West Bank between Jerusalem and the River Jordan occupied by the Jordanian army. In 1964, the anti-Zionist Palestine Liberation Organisation was formed and three years later regional tensions erupted into the Six Day War, which ended in Israel's capture of Jerusalem, Judea, Samaria, Gaza, the Sinai Peninsula and the Golan Heights. After the bloody Yom Kippur War in October 1973, Sinai was returned to the Egyptians.  Thousands of Palestinians were displaced during these conflicts. Since 2012, the United Nations has legally recognised the existence of the State of Palestine within the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, but the area remains under Israeli occupation.  Did you know? • Israel’s official languages are Hebrew and Arabic, although English is still widely used on road signs and by speakers. • Israel consistently rates low in the Global Peace Index. In 2017 it ranked 144th out of 163 countries. • Israel’s top literary award, the Sapir Prize, is presented each June during Hebrew Book Week. 75% Jewish, 18% Muslim, with small numbers of Christians, Druze and other minorities. Israelis are usually very informal but with the European style of hospitality. Israelis are typically blunt and direct in speech, which should not be misinterpreted as rudeness. Israelis also value socialising and building relationships so informal conversation before business is commonplace. Visitors should observe normal courtesies when visiting someone's home and should not be afraid to ask questions about the country, as most Israelis are happy to talk about their homeland, religion and politics. The expression shalom (peace) is used for hello and goodbye. Dress is casual, but in the holy places of all religions, modest attire is worn. For places such as the Western Wall, male visitors are given a smart cardboard yarmulke (skull cap) to respect the religious importance of the site. Business people are expected to dress smartly, or at least in smart casual style, although ties are often not worn. The most expensive of restaurants and nightclubs may expect a similar standard. If formal evening-wear is required, this will be specified on invitations. It is considered a violation of Shabbat (Sabbath, on Saturday) to smoke on that day. There is usually a sign to remind the visitor of this, and to disregard the warning would be regarded as discourteous. Hebrew and Arabic are the official languages of Israel. Other languages include English, French, Hungarian, Polish, Russian, Spanish and Yiddish.","Israel generally has two seasons — summer (Apr-Sep) and winter (Oct-Mar). Cities along the west coast (Haifa, Netanya, Tel Aviv) experience a Mediterranean climate with long, hot summers and mild, rainy winters. In Tel Aviv, January is usually cool with an average high of 17°C (63°F) and an average low of 8°C (46°F). Also expect 70-110mm (8-12 inches) of rain per month from November to February. July and August are hot and humid; August is usually the hottest month with an average high of 31°C (88°F). The best time to visit Tel Aviv is from March to May and September to October, as the weather is pleasant and rainfall is at its lowest. The climate gets more arid as you move further inland. Jerusalem, for example, has dry and pleasant summers and cool winters. January is usually the coolest month with average temperatures hovering around 8°C (46°F). January is also the wettest month. Snow is rare though. The period between April to September is pleasant with little rain; this is the best time to visit Jerusalem. Eilat, Israel's water sport paradise on the Red Sea, has a hot desert climate with extremely little rainfall, making it a year-round holiday destination. Click here for more information on this weather in Eilat and the best time to visit guide. Lightweight clothes for warmer months and also for Eilat. Medium weights are recommended for winters or for nights spent in the desert as the temperature can drop considerably. Israel is on the eastern Mediterranean, bordered by Lebanon and Syria to the north, the Palestine National Authority (West Bank) and Jordan to the east, and Egypt to the south. Gaza, a small coastal strip between Israel and Egypt, is claimed by the Palestine National Authority, but under de facto rule by the militant group Hamas. Although relatively small in size, Israel contains a great variety of terrain and four climate zones. The north of the country is the fertile hill region of Galilee, rising to Mount Hermon and Golan in the northeast. The lush Plain of Sharon runs along the coast, while inland a range of hills and uplands run into the relatively barren and stony areas of the east. Temperatures vary widely throughout the country. The coastal area has long, hot summers and cool, rainy winters. The northern Negev desert has a semi-arid climate while the southern Negev (including Eilat on the Red Sea) has a hot desert climate with extremely little rainfall. The Dead Sea (the lowest point in the world) sits on Israel's eastern border along the great Syrian-African Rift Valley. Israel's largest freshwater lake, the Kinneret (also known the Sea of Galilee), is an important source of drinking water for the country and a significant religious destination for Jewish and Christian pilgrims. Owing to its location on climatic and geographical crossroads, where the northern steppes of Europe meet the Syrian-African Rift Valley, Israel has a surprisingly varied flora and fauna. It has an estimated 2,867 species of flora and approximately 100 species of mammals. The country is also a crucial stop-over on the great bird migrations as they make their way north and south twice a year. The Israel Nature and National Parks Authority is responsible for more than 70 national parks and more than 200 nature reserves in Israel."
middle-east,jordan,"It’s easy to see why Lawrence of Arabia was so taken with Jordan. Probably the most appealing destination in the Middle East, this ancient Arab kingdom is a hospitable land packed with epic scenery and momentous relics. Many travellers visit Jordan with its history in mind, and understandably so. The country is steeped in stories from the distant past, with the ruins to prove it. There’s the 2,000-year-old “lost city” of Petra, carved from rose-red sandstone cliffs by the Nabateans, and the legendary Lawrence of Arabia trail, which takes visitors from his crumbling fort at Azraq to the magnificent deserts of Wadi Rum. Important biblical sites abound; visitors can trek along pilgrimage routes mentioned in the Old Testament, take in views of the Promised Land revealed to Moses and visit Bethany-by-the-Jordan where John baptised Jesus. If Jordan’s overwhelming historical sites begin to wear you out, take a restorative dip in the therapeutic waters of the Dead Sea, go scuba diving over coral reefs in the Red Sea or stay in the desert with Bedouins, who offer travellers a glimpse into their traditional way of life. For all its history and natural beauty, though, Jordan looks forward. Its relatively stable economic and political position in the Middle East has fuelled modernisation, particularly in the capital Amman. With new upmarket hotels, restaurants and bars, the city is no longer just a base from which to explore the ancient sites, but a destination in its own right. In Jordan, hospitality is king. Everywhere you visit you will hear heartfelt words of welcome, and will often be invited into shops or peoples’ homes for a glass of sweet tea and a conversation. In other places this might prelude a hard-sell campaign of carpet-flogging, but in Jordan, it’s almost always borne simply of an interest to engage with a visitor. As the Jordanians say; “Ahlan wa sahlan” – come in and make yourself at home. 89,342 sq km (34,495 sq miles). 7,747,800 (UN estimate 2016). 90.9 per sq km. Amman. Constitutional monarchy.

Before then, it was generally seen only as a small part of the larger Syria region. Jordan was one of the locations where Stone Age hunter-gatherers settled for the first time, building villages and domesticating animals. Settlement expanded during the Bronze Age (roughly 3000-1200 BCE), when Jordan also features in the Old Testament record. The towns of Sodom and Gomorrah were probably located on Jordan’s side of the Dead Sea. During the Iron Age (1200-332 BCE), Jordan clashed with the Israelites, then the Assyrians, Babylonians and Persians, finally coming under Greek control. Around this time, an Arabian tribe known as the Nabateans settled here, naming their capital Petra. They became fabulously wealthy, controlling the lucrative trade in frankincense and spices between Arabia and Europe. In 106 CE the Romans absorbed the Nabatean kingdom, building new roads across Jordan, beautifying cities and fortifying the desert frontier. By the 4th century, Roman security was beginning to crumble. Christianity was adopted and Jordan became a centre for mosaic art. Islamic armies conquered the region in 636. Jordan flourished under the Umayyad dynasty (661-750 CE), which ruled from Damascus, but when power shifted east to the Baghdad-based Abbasid dynasty, Jordan fell into neglect. The invading European Christian armies of the Crusaders briefly occupied Jordan in the 12th century, but under the Ottomans Jordan became a backwater. Following anti-Muslim pogroms in Russia in the 1870s, Circassian refugees settled in Jordan – then largely deserted – re-founding Amman and ushering in Jordan’s modern history. After the Ottoman Turks were repulsed during the Great Arab Revolt of 1916-17, Jordan won independence, first as a British-controlled emirate in 1923 under Abdullah I – a monarch from the Hashemite family of Mecca – then in 1946 as a fully-fledged independent kingdom. Since then, Jordan has taken in huge number of refugees from Palestine, Iraq and Syria, which has shaped the national character. However, attitudes seem to be hardening and in late 2015 the Jordanian government came under fire from human rights groups for deporting Sudanese asylum seekers. As one of the West’s key allies in the Arab world, at peace with Israel, and yet closely bound into regional politics, with strong links to Iraq and Saudi Arabia, Jordan must play one of the trickiest fence-sitting roles in world politics. Did you know? •	Jordan’s national flower is the rare and endangered black iris, which flowers in Wadi Rum in spring. •	Common Jordanian courtesy dictates that a host should give up any household item that a guest shows a particular interest in, so be sparing with your praise when dining in a local’s home. •	Unlike many other countries in the region, Jordan has no oil. Over 92% Sunni Muslim, with 2% Shi'a and Druze Muslim. A significant Greek Orthodox Christian minority (6%) resides mainly in the villages around the hill city of Madaba. Handshaking is the customary form of greeting. Jordanians are proud of their Arab culture and hospitality is a matter of great importance. Visitors are made to feel very welcome and Jordanians are happy to act as hosts and guides, keen to inform tourists about their traditions and culture. Islam always plays an important role in society. Arabic coffee will often be served continuously during social occasions. To signal that no more is wanted, slightly tilt the cup when handing it back, otherwise it will be refilled. If invited for dinner, a small gift is customarily given. Women are expected to dress modestly and beachwear must only be worn at private beaches or poolside. Photography: It is polite to ask permission to take photographs of people and livestock; in some places photography is forbidden. Arabic is the official language. English is widely spoken. French, German, Italian and Spanish are also spoken in many tourist areas.","Jordan is a year-round destination. Even in high summer (June-August), Amman and most areas around the country are not excessively hot, chiefly due to the moderating influence of altitude – Amman stands around 850m (2800ft) above sea level. Similarly, Petra enjoys an elevated position – around 1,100m (3600ft) above sea level, so here, too, although days in summer can be hot, nights are often rather chilly. For Petra, as well as decent walking shoes – the only way in and out of the ruins is by a moderately testing walk over stony ground – also bring something warm for the evenings, even in summer. In winter, Petra can be very cold, with rain and even snow. The Jordan Valley and the Red Sea coast around Aqaba is warm during winter (December-February) – a pleasant relief from the chill elsewhere – but extremely hot in summer (June-August). In the Eastern Desert, the winter can be bitterly cold and dry and the summer intensely hot. Some high-altitude areas, such as Ajloun, Dana and Petra, can receive snowfall in winter. Rain falls in many areas across the country on higher ground between October and March. Lightweight clothes are advised between May and September. Thick winter clothes are essential for winter and a warm layer is necessary for cool summer evenings. Rainwear is advisable from November to March. Jordan borders Israel (and the Palestinian National Authority Region), the Syrian Arab Republic, Iraq and Saudi Arabia. At 400m (1,300ft) below sea level, the Dead Sea, in the northwest of Jordan, is the lowest point on earth and one of the country's most distinctive features. The Red Sea, to which Jordan has a narrow access at Aqaba in the southwest, is teeming with life. The River Jordan flows into the Dead Sea, and there are plans to build a canal - the Two Seas Canal (or the Dead-Red Canal) - that would link the Dead Sea to the Red Sea. Capital Amman perches above the Dead Sea Depression, at a height of 800m (2,625ft), surrounded to the north by undulating hills, and by desert escarpments to the south, on which graze the sheep and goat herds of nomadic tribes. Jordan's northeastern flank is flat desert sprinkled with oases, while the spectacular southeastern desert is characterised by wind-eroded forms and brightly coloured sandstone cliffs."
middle-east,kuwait,"In Kuwait you'll find an intriguing mix of Western liberalism and traditional Islamic culture. The capital, Kuwait City, is a bustling metropolis of high-rise buildings and luxury hotels, while the Gulf country is also home to spectacular mosques and palaces. Religion is an integral part of daily life here. This juxtaposition perhaps stems from Kuwait's marrying of Islamism with oil wealth, which for decades has earned it the attention of Western powers. Upon independence from Britain in 1961, Sheikh Abdullah assumed head of state, adopting the title of emir. The large revenues from oil production allowed independent Kuwait to build up its economic infrastructure and institute educational and social welfare programmes. In the early 1990s, the emir established a National Assembly (Majlis), which placed limits on the power of the ruling family. Since then, the national assembly has clashed several times with the emir and the cabinet (which is still dominated by the al-Sabah family) over misuse of state funds and poor management of the all-important oil industry. Underlying these disputes is the growing impression that the ageing al-Sabah clan is no longer capable of running the country. However, they continue to dominate Kuwaiti policies. Surrounded by three major Middle Eastern powers, Kuwait became the target of Iraqi territorial claims, leading to Saddam Hussein's invasion of the country in 1990. The Kuwaitis later recovered their country by virtue of a US-led, UN-backed multinational military force. After a period of euphoria, the Kuwaitis had to address a number of difficult questions; the future security of the country was dealt with by the signing of defence and security pacts with the USA, the UK and Kuwait's Gulf allies. More recently, Kuwait was one of the first countries to join Operation Iraqi Freedom following the US-led war against Iraq, and provided aid and support during Iraq's (ongoing) process of reconstruction. Beyond the geopolitical dimension, Kuwait is a fascinating country with much elaborate architecture and a superb culinary tradition. Its inhabitants are a warm, welcoming bunch, while the fact that Kuwait is a bit less glitzy than other oil-rich Gulf countries means that it can feel like a haven of tradition Arab culture. 17,818 sq km (6,880 sq miles). 4,007,146 (UN estimate 2016). 156.5 per sq km.

For a century it was controlled by the Bani Khalid tribal confederation, but after various marital alliances and political manoeuvring by members of the rival Bani Utub clan from Basra, by the mid 18th century they had been ousted. When the Utub further splintered in 1766 only one family – the Al Sabah – remained to rule, as it does to this day. By that time Kuwait was established as a major centre for the transport of goods from India, Arabia, Muscat and Baghdad and during the Persian siege of Basra from 1775 to 1779 Iraqi traders took refuge in Kuwait, playing a key role in the burgeoning boat building industry. Its wealth and reputation continued to rise and by the dawn of the 20th century Kuwait was effectively a British colony whose multiculturalism and commercial pragmatism had earned it the soubriquet 'the Marseilles of the Persian Gulf'. However, the first half of the new century was not kind to Kuwait and its economy was seriously damaged by a series of trade blockades and the collapse of its pearl industry. Its revival was entirely due to the West's thirst for oil, which had been discovered in 1937 by the Anglo-American Kuwait Oil Company. Delayed by World War 2, exportation began in 1951 and within a year Kuwait was the Gulf's largest exporter, fuelling what has become known as the Golden Era. That ended in 1982 with the Iran-Iraq War and Kuwait suffered a series of terror attacks as well as a major economic crisis precipitated by falling oil prices. In August 1990 Iraqi forces annexed Kuwait leading to the First Gulf War when a US-led UN coalition was deployed in February 1991 to liberate Kuwait, which then became the springboard for the invasion of Iraq in 1993. Following the death of the Emir Jabir in 2006, Sheikh Sa'ad al-Sabah ruled for just nine days before Parliament voted him out of office due to ill health. Sheikh Sabah al-Sabah succeeded him and remains on the throne to this day. Kuwait was the first Arab country in the Gulf to have an elected parliament and in 2005 granted full political rights to women. Did you know? • Kuwaiti soap operas are the most watched in the Gulf region and are shown as far away as Tunisia. • Kuwait has a highly developed tradition of theatre-going that dates back to the 1920s. • The name Kuwait is a contraction of an Arab word meaning 'fortress built near water'. 95% Muslim (mostly of the Sunni sect), with Christian and Hindu minorities. Handshaking is the customary form of greeting. It is quite likely that a visitor will be invited to a Kuwaiti's home, but entertaining is also conducted in hotels and restaurants. A small gift promoting the company, or representing your own country, is always welcome. The visitor will notice that most Kuwaitis wear the national dress of long white dishdashes and white headcloths, and that many women wear yashmaks. It is important for women to dress modestly according to Islamic law. Men do not usually wear shorts in public and should not go shirtless. All other Islamic rules and customs must be respected. Convicted users of narcotics can expect to receive a sentence of up to five years' imprisonment, plus a heavy fine. Kuwait outlawed smoking indoors in public in 2012, but there is often little enforcement of this law. It is greatly appreciated if visitors learn at least a few words of Arabic. Homosexuality is illegal, as is any public affection between men and women. Cohabitation is also illegal. The import and use of drugs, alcohol, pork products and obscene material are forbidden and can lead to imprisonment. Arabic, but English is widely understood, especially in commerce and industry.","Kuwait shares European weather patterns but is hotter and drier. Summers (April to October) are hot and humid with very little rain. Winters (November to March) are cool with limited rain. Springs are cool and pleasant. Kuwait shares borders with Iraq and Saudi Arabia. To the southeast lies the Persian Gulf, where Kuwait has sovereignty over nine small islands (the largest is Bubiyan and the most populous is Failaka). The landscape is predominantly desert plateau with a lower, more fertile coastal belt."
middle-east,lebanon,"Fringed by golden beaches, peppered with World Heritage Sites and home to the Middle East's premier party city, Lebanon has all the hallmarks of a classic traveller's destination. Yet the reality, alas, is not quite so rosy. Still recovering from a brutal civil war (1975-1990), the conflict in neighbouring Syria is spilling across the border and the Bekaa Valley remains a stronghold for the militant group Hezbollah. Suffice to say, cautious tourists have stayed away. Nevertheless, for now, a fragile peace prevails in Lebanon, which extends a warm welcome to foreign visitors. Nowhere is this clearer than in the capital, Beirut, a friendly party town sandwiched between the Mediterranean Sea and the foothills of Mount Lebanon. Characterised by its affable inhabitants, dramatic coastline and delicious cuisine, bustling Beirut sits at the crossroads between Europe and Arabia. Influences from east and west abound – it is not uncommon to hear the call to prayer competing with DJs in some of the livelier parts of town. Although buildings still bear the scars of past conflicts, the city is a forward-thinking capital where the biggest danger nowadays seems to be the traffic – crossing the road can feel like an extreme sport. Though small in size, Lebanon boasts five UNESCO World Heritage Sites including the city of Byblos, one of the oldest Phoenician ports, and the haunting remains of Baalbeck in the Hezbollah-run Bekaa Valley, one of the finest examples of Greco-Roman architecture in existence. Other highlights including the magnificent cedar forests and Christian monasteries of the Holy Valley, as well as the ancient cities of Tyr and Tripoli, home to one of the oldest seaports in the world. And if that's not enough, there's always skiing in Mount Lebanon. Granted, it might not be an obvious place to hit the slopes, but there are few places in this world that can offer sun, sand and skiing in one day. But then Lebanon is not your average destination. 10,452 sq km (4,036 sq miles). 5,988,153 (UN estimate 2016). 591.7 per sq km. Beirut. Republic. President Michel Aoun since 2016. Prime Minister Najib Mikati since 2021.","Lebanon's advantageous geographical location on the edge of the Mediterranean and at the crossroads between Europe and the Middle East has shaped its historical, cultural and political identity. The earliest evidence of civilisation in Lebanon dates back more than 7000 years and the area was a stronghold of the powerful seafaring Phoenicians who founded important coastal trading ports like Tyre, Tripoli and Byblos. The Turks took control of the area in the 16th century during the major expansion of the Ottoman Empire and remained there until the end of World War 1. Lebanon was created in its present boundaries in 1920 under the French Mandate, which administered the country until Lebanon gained independence and became a republic in 1943. For several decades Lebanon's diverse religious groups existed in relative harmony and the country developed a thriving economy, while Beirut became one of the most visited cities in the Mediterranean. However, in the early 1970s large numbers of PLO (Palestine Liberation Organization) fighters expelled from Jordan sought refuge in Lebanon, which in 1975 led to civil war with Beirut split across the Green Line, dividing the Christian-dominated east and the Muslim west. In 1982 the presence of the PLO led to an Israeli invasion of Lebanon and although they retreated to a self-declared security zone in the south there followed an intense guerrilla war with Hezbollah that continued despite the peacekeeping efforts of the international community. Peace returned to most of Lebanon in 1990, although fighting continued between Israel and Shia militia in the south until Israeli occupation ended a decade later. With a more stable political environment, the lengthy process of rebuilding Beirut began in earnest and the country seemed poised to make a comeback until the assassination on 14 February 2005 of former Prime Minister Rafic Hariri in a bomb attack in Beirut. Since 2006 Lebanon has been embroiled political crisis. A major conflict erupted between Lebanon and Israel, which resulted in heavy fighting and large-scale loss of life on both sides of the border. A ceasefire finally came into place, following intervention from the UN Security Council. In 2009 Rafiq Hariri's son, Saad Hariri was elected prime minister and formed a national unity government, but the relative stability that ensued did not last and in January 2011 the government collapsed. A new government led by Najib Mikati was formed in June.  Did you know? • In the 1960s Lebanon was known as the 'Switzerland of the East'. • Next to Israel, Lebanon is the largest recipient of US military aid per head of population. • Several Lebanese writers have achieved international success, most notably Khalil Gibran whose 1923 book The Prophet is a modern classic. There are 18 registered sects in Lebanon with Islam and Christianity the main religions. Islam (predominantly Shi'ite) accounts for approximately 59.7% of the population's beliefs, while Christian denominations, mainly Greek Orthodox, Maronite, Armenian and Protestant, account for a further 39%. Lebanese people are known for their hospitality. A handshake is the normal form of greeting. It is acceptable to give a small gift, particularly if invited home for a meal. As far as dress is concerned, casual dress is suitable for daytime wear, except in main towns where dress tends to be rather formal. Smarter hotels and restaurants often require guests to dress for dinner. Since Lebanon is almost evenly divided between those adhering to the Muslim faith, and those adhering to the Christian faith, visitors should dress according to the custom of the majority in the individual places being visited. In 2012 smoking was prohibited in enclosed public places such as cafes, restaurants and hotels. The official language is Arabic, followed by French as the second language. English is widely spoken. Armenian is spoken by a small percentage of the population.","Lebanon has a typically Mediterranean climate. There are four distinct seasons. Summer (June to September) is hot on the coast and cooler in the mountains. Spring and autumn are warm and pleasant and are the ideal times to visit for sightseeing. Winter (December to mid March) is mostly rainy, with snow in the mountains so this is the ideal time to visit to enjoy winter sports, but at lower altitudes sightseeing can be hindered by heavy rainfall. Lightweight fabrics such as cotton and linen are best for the summer months and warm clothes for the winter period with rain protection or thermal clothing for higher altitudes. Lebanon lies to the east of the Mediterranean, sharing borders to the north and east with the Syrian Arab Republic, and to the south with Israel/Palestinian Territory. The country possesses four distinct zones from west to east including the coastal plain, the Mount Lebanon Range, the Bekaa Valley and the Anti Lebanon range that forms its border with Syria. Lebanon is a mountainous country with approximately half of its landscape lying at an altitude of over 900m (3,000ft). For its relatively diminutive size, Lebanon offers a surprisingly diverse landscape from the fertile Bekaa Valley to the snow capped peaks of the Anti Lebanon and cedar forests of Mount Lebanon. The famous cedar trees grow high in the mountains, while the lower slopes are cultivated with grapes, apricots, plums, peaches, figs, olives and barley, often on terraces painstakingly cut out from the mountainsides. On the coastal plain, citrus fruit, bananas and vegetables are also grown."
middle-east,oman,"Camel treks, desert camping and 4-wheel drive safaris through mighty canyons are just some of the adventures awaiting visitors to Oman. From frankincense plantations and atmospheric souks that speak of vanished centuries to gleaming modern cities and 5-star hotels fronting on to perfect beaches, Oman is everything you would want from Arabia. What marks this desert kingdom out from its neighbours is a complex history of interaction with the outside world. From the ports of Muscat and Salahat, Omani traders roamed across the Arabian Sea, pushing back the borders of the Portuguese empire in Africa and founding trading outposts as far afield as Zanzibar and Mozambique, before aligning with the British after the abolition of slavery. The result, thirteen centuries later, is an outwardly conservative, but strikingly open Islamic society, with a firm belief in the importance of its own traditions but a strong acceptance of other cultures. Many regard Oman as the most welcoming of all the Arabic nations; this is a place where foreigners are invited to sit and sip tea and eat dates out of genuine hospitality, rather than as a preamble to selling souvenirs. The ruling sultans have taken great pains to preserve the traditional crafts and customs of their ancient civilisation, and the cities of Oman feel much more historic and lived-in than the skyscraper cities appearing elsewhere in the Gulf. The borders of Oman are guarded by a staggering 2,000 desert fortresses, most meticulously restored. It’s easy here to feel transported back to the days of Arabian Nights. Along the coastline, enigmatic dhows still sail from port to port, while rugged wadis (river valleys) snake into the interior, studded with date-palm plantations, dramatic rock formations and hidden pools. Beyond, immaculately tarmacked highways cross the desert to neighbouring Yemen, Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates, though many chose to fly to avoid endless drives through barren desert scenery. More than anything though, Oman is a place to feel safe and at ease. The Omanis are gracious hosts, and visitors will find traditional Arabian hospitality and Islamic culture at its very best. 309,500 sq km (119,499 sq miles). 4,654,471 (UN estimate 2016). 10.6 per sq km. Muscat. Sultanate. Sultan and Prime Minister Haitham ibn Tariq since 2020. Sultan and Prime Minister Haitham ibn Tariq since 2020.","The ancient history of Oman is steeped in mystery. Primitive men lived in this part of the Arabian Peninsula as early as 100,000 years ago, and the region was incorporated into the Persian Achaemenid Empire in the 6th century BC. With the birth of the Prophet Mohammed in the 7th century, Oman followed the lead of Persia and converted to Islam, leading to the rise of a string of Islamic dynasties. In 1507, the sultans lost their prized possession of Muscat to Portuguese invaders, and while the colonial administration was fiercely resisted, and lasted little more than century, this period saw the construction of many of Oman’s famous fortresses. With the restoration of Islamic rule, Oman became a major trading empire, with colonies as far afield as central Africa and Zanzibar. The cornerstones of the Omani economy were the spice trade and slavery, which was only abolished in 1970. Close ties have been maintained with the UK since 1798, when a treaty of friendship was signed. Oman became a British protectorate in 1891 and Britain continued to play a guiding role in the politics of Oman through to the 1950s, when the nation gained its independence. In 1913, Oman was split in two, with the coast ruled by the sultan and the interior ruled by separate religious leaders, but the nation was reunited in 1959. Since the accession of Sultan Qaboos bin Said Al Said in a bloodless coup in 1970, Oman has undergone significant political, economic and industrial reform, particularly in industry, communications, transport and education. Ahead of most surrounding nations in the Gulf, women gained the vote for local majlis (councils) in 1997, and universal suffrage was introduced in 2002. Today, the sultan remains the head of state and head of government but he is advised by an elected council of ministers, which acts as a cabinet. Oil forms a major part of the nation’s considerable wealth, and thanks to its long history cooperation with Europe, Oman plays an important role in promoting regional stability. However, there has been local opposition to the continued power of the ruling clan, and the use of Oman as staging post for Western military operations in the region. Did you know? •	Oman is one of the world’s oldest producers of Frankincense, an aromatic resin that has been used as a perfume since Biblical times. •	The first horse in Arabia is said to have been kept by the Uzd tribe of Oman; all Arabic racehorses are said to be its descendants. •	Oman was one of the last countries in the world to abolish slavery, in 1970. Predominantly Muslim, including Shi'ite Muslim, Sunni Muslim and the Ibadi strand of Islam, the latter practised by 60% of the population (the only country in the world to do so). There are facilities for the worship of other religions. Around 13% of the population are Hindu. Shaking hands is the usual form of greeting. A small gift, either promoting your company or country, is well received. Dignity and respect are key in Omani culture and public criticisms are rare. As far as dress is concerned, it is important that women dress modestly beyond the hotel grounds, ie long skirts or dresses (below the knee) with covered shoulders; men should wear trousers and shirts with sleeves. Tight-fitting clothes should be restricted to hotel restaurants to avoid giving offence, although this is not strictly followed by some Westerners. Shorts should not be worn in public and beachwear is prohibited anywhere except the beach. Collecting seashells, abalone, corals, crayfish and turtle eggs is also prohibited. Dumping litter is forbidden. It is polite not to smoke in public, but generally no-smoking signs are posted where appropriate; smoking is banned in public places in Muscat. Homosexual behaviour is illegal. Photography: Visitors should ask permission before attempting to photograph people or their property. 'No Photography' signs exist in certain places and must be observed. Arabic is the official language. English is widely spoken. Swahili is also spoken by Omani descendents from East Africa. German and French are spoken by some hotel staff while Urdu, Farsi, Hindi and Tagalog are widely spoken by Oman's large expatriate workforce.","Because Oman is so large and the terrain diverse, the climatic conditions are as varied as the geography. The most popular time to visit is from October to April when the weather is warm and sunny and temperatures range from a very pleasant 25°C (77°F) to around 35°C (95°F) during the day. It is cooler at night, ranging in temperature from 17°C (63°F) to 19°C (66°F). From May to August, it is very hot and humid at the coastal areas, while the interior generally remains hot and dry. Between May and September, the southern Dhofar region has its own microclimate. Known as the khareef, the area catches the Indian Ocean’s monsoon season and temperatures can be 10-15°C (18-27°F) lower than the rest of the country. Most of the rain falls during the winter months and varies according to the region. Other than in Dhofar, it is rare to see rain between May and November. The coastal areas and the interior plains average 20-100mm (0.8-4 inches) of rainfall annually but this can rise to around 900mm (35 inches) in the mountains. It is common to see snowfall on the highest mountain peaks during the winter. Lightweight cottons are advisable throughout the year, with a warm wrap for cooler winter evenings, mountain excursions and overworked air-conditioning in shops and restaurants. When touring, khaki or beige are more suitable colours to wear than white, as the dry, dusty conditions can discolour clothing. Oman is a Muslim country and, while it is relatively moderate, visitors should be sensitive to its customs. Women should not bare shoulders or show low cleavage and should not wear short shorts or short skirts. Long shorts should ideally be below the knee. They should also carry a large scarf or pashmina with them at all times in case they need to cover their head. This is essential when visiting mosques. Men should only wear long, baggy shorts, and preferably trousers outside hotels. Swimming costumes are confined to hotel pools and beachwear should be modest. Most hotels do not require women to cover up when swimming, although women may choose to do so when bathing in the sea on public beaches. The Sultanate of Oman occupies the southeastern edge of the Arabian Peninsula and a total area of 309,500 sq km (119,500 sq miles or roughly the same size as Italy) including the coastal islands of Masirah, Halanyat and Salama, plus Musandam and Madha, which are completely surrounded by the United Arab Emirates. It is bordered by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to the northwest, the Republic of Yemen to the southwest and the United Arab Emirates to the north. Oman has 2,092 km (1,300 miles) of coastline on the Gulf, Arabian Sea and the Gulf of Oman. The interior is covered by a vast expanse of desert with around 82% of the landmass occupied by deserts and valleys. The Hajjar mountain range, which occupies around 15% of the country’s landmass, forms an arc extending from the northwest of the country to the southeast. The highest mountain is Jabal Shams, at around 2,980m (9,777ft)."
middle-east,palestinian-national-authority,"With fertile river plains and scrubby desert, Mediterranean olive groves and many historical marvels, Palestine has plenty to offer. Sadly, war and outbreaks of violence have badly damaged the appeal of this hotly contested land. But despite the widely held perception, Palestine is not a tourist-free zone, with more than two million travellers arriving each year. The bulk of tourists head for Bethlehem, largely through organised tours from Jerusalem. The main attraction is the Church of the Nativity, thought to mark the spot where Jesus Christ was born. There’s also the winding Star Street, believed to be the path Mary and Joseph took on entering the city. Far from just a pilgrimage site, Bethlehem is fascinating for what remains of the ancient biblical town, as well as its little medina-style streets and bustling market. Foreign investment is trickling through the city, which isn’t as down-at-heel as many expect, with a few museums now open and lots of shops. Adventurous tourists head for the Separation Barrier, just outside Bethlehem; apart from dividing Israeli and Palestinian territories, the wall is covered in spectacular graffiti by local and international artists including Banksy. At present, the majority of tourists stick to Bethlehem. But Hebron in the southern West Bank is the largest city in the territory and essential viewing, not least for its fabled souks. The ancient city of Jericho is also attractive for its garden restaurants and stunning Hisham Palace, while Ramallah, the de facto capital of the Palestinian Authority, is interesting for its lively energy and ubiquitous cafés. Travel to Gaza, a densely populated slither of coastal land bordering Egypt and separated from the rest of Palestine by Israel, is nearly impossible – especially after the devastating 2014 conflict. But the West Bank remains surprisingly accessible, and while travel advice should be heeded, it is relatively safe. 6,335 sq km (2,446 sq miles) made up of the West Bank territories, 5,970 sq km (2,305 sq miles) and the Gaza Strip, 365 sq km (141 sq miles). 4.7 million (2015). 734.7 per sq km.

During the Bronze Age, the area was dominated by Canaanite city states, before the Philistines invaded – possible from Crete, or elsewhere in the Aegean – in the 2nd millennium BC. History thereafter is rather muddled in the context of biblical texts and religious belief, but the Philistines are thought to have come into conflict with Israelite tribes in the area around the turn of the 1st millennium BC. In the 8th and 7th centuries BC, the Asyrrians overran Palestine, followed later by the Persians and the armies of Alexander the Great. The Romans finally established the province of Judea during the 1st century BC. Struggles with the Romans led to the destruction of the Second Temple in the 1st century AD, leaving only the Western Wall standing. Less than a century later, Hadrian renamed the territory Syria Palaestina and banished the Jews. The Byzantine period up until the 7th century AD saw Palestine become a Christian province, with significant Jewish communities. The land prospered, but with the rise of the Caliphate, Jerusalem was besieged and Palestine became war-torn for centuries. Crusaders from Europe sought to retake the so-called Holy Land from Muslim rulers, succeeding in establishing a Christian kingdom between 1099 and the late 12th century. In the 15th century, the Ottoman Empire absorbed the territory and largely promoted religious tolerance, controlling Palestine until the British Mandate began after World War I. A couple of years after World War II, the UN proposed a partition of Palestine between its Jewish and Arab-Palestinian populations and some three million Jews, many of whom had been persecuted by the Nazis, moved to the newly-formed state of Israel. A war between Israel and neighbouring Arab states ensued. Further wars in 1967 and 1973 led to the consolidation of Israel and the enduring occupation of Palestinian territories. There have been two Intifadas, whereby the Arab-Palestinian population has risen up against the Israeli state, with bloody consequences. To date, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict remains unresolved and a source of much controversy throughout the Middle East. Did you know? • Two of the world’s biggest religions, Judaism and Christianity, were born on Palestinian soil. • The Palestinian region is thought to be amongst the earliest places to have seen human habitation and civilisation. • Built in the late 7th century, the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem is regarded by many as the first great work of Islamic architecture. Muslim, Christian and Judaism minority. Women in particular should dress modestly. Ramallah is less strict than other areas but bare shoulders, shorts and short skirts are still inadvisable. Visitors may choose not to eat, drink or smoke in public places between sunrise and sunset during Ramadan in order to avoid causing offence.Visitors should also be sensitive when taking pictures of military or police personnel and installations, and when photographing people in Muslim and Orthodox Jewish areas. It is advisable to carry identification at all times, and photocopies of the date and entry stamp on your passport. Arabic is the official language. English and Hebrew are widely spoken.","Palestine has a temperate, Mediterranean climate. The rainy season in Palestine is between November and April. Winter can get rather cold and wet. Southern areas can get uncomfortably hot during the summer months. Spring and autumn are the best times to visit, with temperatures of around 23°C (74°F). The desert can get cold at night, even during the summer months, so it is advisable to carry extra layers to wear. Otherwise, lightweight clothes are advisable in summer. Warmer clothes are required for the winter months. The two territories of Palestine lie within Israel, around 40km (25 miles) apart at their closest point. The West Bank is to the west of the River Jordan, bordered by Jordan to the east and Israel to the north, south and west. The Gaza Strip, in Israel's southwest, is a narrow stretch of land bordered by the Mediterranean to the west and Egypt to the south. The Great Rift Valley follows the path of the River Jordan running along the West Bank and through the lowest point in the world, the Dead Sea at 390m (1,280ft) below sea level, before continuing on into Eastern Africa. The Jordanian Valley is green and fertile; the south contains the Judean Desert."
middle-east,qatar,"The eyes of the world are on Qatar right now. Following the discovery of oil in the 1940s, this small Gulf state has been catapulted from a small fishing and trading hub to one of the richest (per capita) countries in the world. Fuelled by oil and natural gas revenue, Qatar is developing at breakneck speed. Everything from universities to shopping malls, five-star hotels to football stadiums are springing up across the desert floor. Modern Qatar is, for all intents and purposes, a city-state. Over half of the country's population lives in and around the capital, Doha. Other towns and districts are interspersed between oil compounds that provide Qatar with most of its wealth. Beyond oil fields, the country has its share of natural beauty, with gorgeous beaches line the western coast while spectacular dunes surround Khor Al Adaid in the south. The large expense of Al Thakira mangroves near Al Khor on the eastern seaboard also provides a sharp contrast to the adjoining desert landscape. While Islam is the predominant religion in Qatar, the society is refreshingly tolerant. Expats are free to practise other religions and their civil liberties respected. The press is also among the freest in the region. While matching towards liberalisation, Qatar has not lost sight of its deeply ingrained religious and cultural heritage either. Alcohol is only served in hotel bars and restaurants, work calendars are very much decided by religious commitments such as Ramadan, traditional sports such as falconry and camel-racing remain popular pastimes. Indeed, much like the geometrically patterned Islamic Art found all over the country, Qatar is a complex, yet beautiful country. 11,627 sq km (4,489 sq miles) 2,788,000 (2019) 240 per sq km Doha Emirate Amir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani since 2013.

In 1916, Qatar signed a treaty with Britain and became a British protectorate. In 1940, oil was discovered in Dukhan and after the operations went commercial in 1949, the country became rich. In 1968, Qatar briefly joined other small Gulf nations which would become the United Arab Emirates – but Qatar soon pulled out and became independent on 3 September 1971. After independence, Qatar sought to promote political openness by sponsoring Al Jazeera, a television network known for its independent news coverage. The country also hosts a large US military base. But its relations with its neighbours, notably Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates, have been strained in recent years due to Qatar's alleged support for militant Islamist groups (including the Muslim Brotherhood) and its friendly relations with Iran. Since 2017, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain and Egypt have cut diplomatic ties with Qatar and imposed an economic blockade. Did you know: • There is a blue road in Qatar. Abdullah Bin Jassim Street near Souq Waqif is painted blue, instead of the usual black asphalt. Apart from pleasing to the eye, the blue colour absorbs and radiates less heat, making the road cooler too. • Camel racing is one of the popular sports in Qatar. During races, the camel jockeys are actually robots placed atop the camel, remotely controlled by the camel owners. • Qatar funds the Al Jazeera Media Network, known for its independent news coverage. About 95% of Qataris are Sunni Muslims. Like in any country, it is important to observe local courtesies. Visitors (both men and women) should not wear revealing clothing in public places. Beachwear and bikinis are acceptable by the hotel pool but not in public places. Business meetings usually start with handshakes between men and titles (such as Sheikh or Haji) should be used to show respect. Small talk is common and is a way of relationship building. Never rush to bring up business matters. Exchange of business cards is also common when meeting for the first time and take a moment to read the card you receive because it is considered rude to put it away without reading it. Ideally, your name card should have Arabic printed on one side. Arabic is the official language. English is widely spoken.","Occupying a small land on the eastern coast of the Arabian Peninsula, the sovereign state of Qatar has a dry, subtropical desert climate with low annual rainfall and intensely hot and humid summers. The weather in Qatar can be broadly grouped into two seasons: hot (May to October) and cool (December to February). March, April and November are transitional months, meaning the weather is hot but tolerable. The best time to visit Qatar is from December to February when the temperatures are mild with average highs ranging between 22°C (72°F) and 25°C (77°F). January is the coolest month with temperatures ranging from 14°C (57°F) to 22°C (72°F). Temperatures start to climb in February and by March, the average high is back to 29°C (84°F). November and March are ideal times to visit too if you like warmer temperatures. Although the cool period is the best time to visit Qatar, bear in mind that rainfall, however scarce, occurs during this period too, and the rains come mostly in heavy cloudbursts and thunderstorms. The hot period (May to October) is best avoided. July is often considered the hottest month with temperatures ranging from 32°C (90°F) to 43°C (109°F) – although it's not unusual for the thermometer to reach an eye-watering high of 50°C (122°F) in July and sometimes August. If you're visiting during the hot period, you may find yourself seeking refuge in one of the many air-conditioned malls. After October, things start to cool down and by November, you can expect an average high of 30°C (86°F). Because Qatar is a small and flat country, there is little regional variation in the weather, although coastal areas may be slightly cooler than inland. Doha, the capital of Qatar, is highly urbanised which can make the weather in Doha feel slightly hotter than it is. See our guide on weather in Doha and the best time to visit. Lightweight cotton and linen are recommended throughout the year. A cardigan is useful for the cooled malls while a jacket is a must for cooler evenings during the cool season. If you intend to take a camping trip from January to March, you'll be glad to have packed an extra layer of clothing for night time. Although women visitors do not need to wear a hijab (headscarf) or abaya (full-length black cloak), loose-fitting cotton dresses that cover your shoulders and knees are ideal. Avoid anything that is tight or revealing. Men should also dress modestly. Beware that bikinis and beachwear are acceptable at the hotel pool but not in public places. The Qatar peninsula is about 160km (99 miles) from north to south and 80km (50 miles) from east to west. Much of the country consists of low-lying desert but has elevated limestone plateau in the centre of the country. There are no rivers or freshwater lakes in Qatar. On the east coast of Qatar, there is a large area of mangroves near Al Khor on the northeastern side. The coastline then transforms into large sabkha (salt flats) as it inches towards the southeastern end. In the south of the country, Khor Al Adaid, translated to as 'Inland Sea', is where the sea, together with the surrounding large tidal embayment, spills into the desert, creating a unique landscape. On the northern side of the country, there are small pockets of agricultural lands used for growing dates, along with some vegetable patches. On the west coast of Qatar lies the Dukhan Field, the country's main oil field. Geographically, there are several small hills stretching from Dukhan towards the border with Saudi Arabia."
middle-east,saudi-arabia,"No country in the world is as misunderstood as the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and perhaps no other country is worthy of a visit. Saudi Arabia is an incredibly dynamic tourist destination, boasting seemingly endless sand dunes, palm-shaded oases, dramatic mountaintops and numerous marine reserves and wildlife sanctuaries. In the west of the country you will find untamed stretches of coral-filled Red Sea coast and southwestern mountain towns such as Taif, famed for producing rose oil and rose water. The ancient history in the north is perhaps one of the country's greatest draws – the region of Al-Jouf is packed with ancient castle ruins and massive pillars carved from sandstone dating back thousands of years, while the city of AlUla is the gateway to the Hegra Archaeological Site, which features a collection of stone dwellings similar to Petra in Jordan. A large part of the country is desert and the sands are wondrous. The Empty Quarter (Rub' al-Khali), a beautiful expanse of undulating dunes unlike anywhere in the world, is a must-see. Then there are the cosmopolitan cities of Jeddah (on the Red Sea coast), Riyadh (the capital), and Dammam (on the Persian Gulf), all of which have undergone a remarkable cultural transformation, successfully blending ancient customs and ever-evolving lifestyles in the modern world. Here, visitors can also find world-class museums, fine-dining options, and fantastic shopping choices. Saudi Arabia is also rich in culture and heritage. It is, after all, the birthplace of Prophet Muhammad and home to the two holiest sites in Islam: the Grand Mosque (Masjid al-Haram) in Makkah and the Prophet's Mosque (Al-Masjid an-Nabawi) in Medina; both of which draw millions of visitors each year. Understandably, the Saudis take pride in protecting the integrity of this holy land. Saudi Arabia is perhaps an elusive and mysterious place, steeped in religion and cultural tradition to a novice visitor. But if you're willing to come for a visit, you'll discover a magnificent country with much to offer. 2,149,690 sq km (830,000 sq miles). 34.81 million (2020). 16 per sq km. Riyadh. Absolute monarchy. King and Prime Minister Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud since 2015. Crown Prince and Prime Minister Muhammad ibn Salman since 2022.","Sandwiched between the Empires of Rome and Asia, Saudi Arabia was an important trade centre where caravans laden with highly prized spices, myrrh and frankincense traversed the Arabian Peninsula. Around the year 610, Saudi Arabia became the birthplace of Islam when Prophet Muhammad, a native of Makkah, received a message from Allah through the Angel Gabriel. When the Prophet started to preach the oneness of God, his popularity grew and many converted to Islam. In 622, Prophet Muhammad led his followers to the town of Yathrib, which was later renamed Madinat Al-Nabi or Medina. This event, known as the Hijrah, now marks the beginning of the Islamic calendar. The modern Kingdom of Saudi Arabia started in 1932 when King Abdulaziz successfully united various tribes into one nation. The new nation quickly embarked on various plans to modernise through economic and social development initiatives. In recent years, in the wake of a diminished oil market, Saudi Arabia has been keen to diversify its economy away from its dependence on oil. Tourism, healthcare and tech-based industry are some of the areas that the government is expanding. Did you know? • Arabic words and sentences are written and read from right to left, and books and papers from back to front. • Saudi has a high population of youth. In 2020, young people aged 15-34 made up 36.7% of the Kingdom's population. • Saudi Arabia has a desert climate but its mountains in the northern region receive snowfall from time to time. About 83% Sunni Muslims and 9% Shia Muslims. There are many foreigners working in Saudi Arabia and they have different faiths. Islamic law is enforced and local courtesies should be observed. The most common form of greeting is using the phrase Salam Alaykum, meaning 'may peace be upon you', followed by a handshake (between men). Between close friends of the same gender, they may greet each other with kisses on the cheek or press their noses together. Women may greet each other with kisses on the cheek, though they are more restrained in public. Public displays of affection between the opposite sex should be avoided. Invitations to private homes are not common, as entertaining is usually done in hotels or restaurants. Visitors should always bring a small gift and use only the right hand to pass food and eat – although knives and forks are most likely to be used. If you are invited to a home, beware that every Saudi home has a majlis, a dedicated entertainment room where the host offers dates and qahwa (lighted roasted coffee ground with cardamom and flavoured with saffron) in small cups to visitors. Visitors should not venture beyond the majlis. What to wear in Saudi Arabia for men and women? Visitors (both men and women) should dress conservatively. Loose-fitting garments that cover the elbow and below the ankle are required for both sexes. For example, a man should wear a long-sleeved shirt and a pair of trousers, but nothing too tight. While an abaya (a long robe) is no longer a must for women, we still recommend you to purchase one because it is comfortable and it allows you to wear a long dress or a blouse and pants underneath it. It is also possible to wear less (like a t-shirt and calf-length pants) underneath the abaya, provided that you are mindful and conceal them properly with your abaya. Foreign women are also not required to cover their hair with a hijab (head covering). Children aren't subject to any specific dress code, although they are recommended to dress modestly. In terms of footwear, there are no restrictions. Trainers, open-toed shoes and even sandals are allowed. However, you must remove your footwear before entering religious sites. Saudi Arabia takes violations of public decency seriously. All visitors should read up the public conduct and decency laws before their trip by following this link. Photography Beware that taking pictures of videos of people, government buildings and national infrastructures without permission is a fineable offence. Ramadan Ramadan is the holy month of fasting where Muslims abstain from food and drink from sunrise to sunset. Visitors should also not eat and drink in public during this period. Many shops are closed during the day but open when night falls. At the end of Ramadan is Eid Al Fitr, a public holiday that sees many festive events taking place across the country. Arabic. English is also widely spoken (many Saudis speak excellent English). Common Arabic Phrases • It's nice to meet you = Forsa sa'eda or Tasharrafna • Do you speak English? = Tetkalam Engleezy? • I don't understand much Arabic = Ma afham Arabi • What is your name? = Eysh Esmk? • My name is … = Ismii … • How are you? = Kaif halak? Kaif al hal? or Kafik? • I'm fine, thank you = Ana bikhayr shukran • How much? = Kam? or Be kam?","Saudi Arabia has a desert climate characterised by dry, hot summers and mild winters. Rainfall is scarce, and sharp temperature changes between day and night should be expected. Spring (March to June) is warm, though the temperatures at night can dip below 15°C (59°F) in the north, but in the south (particularly around Abhā in the southwest), spring is the rainiest season. Summer (June to September) is long and hot; it is usual to see the temperature hitting 45°C (113°F). However, the hilly southwest is much cooler. Autumn (October to November) is still relatively warm with day time temperatures hovering around 30°C (86°F), although evenings are pleasant, with temperatures dropping to around 15°C (59°F) in most cities. Winter (December to March) is the best time to visit Saudi Arabia as the weather is mild with plenty of sunny days and cool nights. It is possible to see snow in the north – you may even be lucky enough to try snow sledging in the mountains around Tabuk. Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia, sits on a rocky plateau in the centre of the country. Its relatively high elevation (594m or 1950ft above sea level) means that it is sunny year-round and less humid than other Saudi cities. July and August are the warmest months with an average temperature of 36°C (97°F). The period between June and September is also dry with no rain at all, while the months between November and April receive about 100mm (4in) of rain. Jeddah, a major port city on the Red Sea coast, has hot and humid weather. July is the hottest month in Jeddah with an average high of 38°C (100°F) while January is the coolest month with an average high of 28°C (82°F). The city receives very little rain, averaging just 20mm (0.8in) a year. The evenings are mild in Jeddah and they offer opportunities to enjoy the waterfront, the Jeddah Corniche, which features miles of sandy beaches and three swimming bays. Makkah, also spelt Mecca, is the holiest city in Islam as it was here that the Quran was first revealed to the Prophet Muhammad. The city sits in a desert valley 86km (53mi) east of Jeddah. Daytime temperatures often hover above 40°C (104°F) between May and September but the evenings are cooler. The weather in January is most pleasant, with an average high of 31°C (88°F) and an average low of 19°C (66°F). Pack sunscreen, sunglasses and sun hats, and use layers (light sweaters or scarves) for air-conditioned buildings and cooler evenings. A rain jacket may be required, depending on when and where you are going. The largest country in the Arabian Peninsula, Saudi Arabia is bordered to the northwest by Jordan, to the north by Iraq and Kuwait, to the east by the Persian Gulf, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, and to the south by Oman and Yemen. To the west lies the Red Sea. Along the Red Sea coast is a narrow coastal plain (Tihamah), which is hot and humid throughout the year. Beyond the plain is a series of hills and mountains, and in the southwest, near Abha, is where you will find Jabal Sawda, the highest point of the Kingdom standing at 3,133m (10,279ft) above sea level. 95% of Saudi Arabia is desert. Rub' Al Khali, meaning the Empty Quarter, occupies 650,000 sq km (250,966 sq mi) in the south-eastern part of the country. This is the largest desert in the Arabian Peninsula and is absolutely beautiful – visitors can expect undulating sand dunes rising from the ground and rolling away to a distant horizon. Another sizable desert is Al Nufud Al Kabir, located near the borders with Iraq and Kuwait. The sand dunes here can be shaped into mounds towering over a hundred meters."
middle-east,syrian-arab-republic,"Until the recent civil war, Syria was a diverse destination that revelled in its antiquity. Inhabited for tens of thousands of years, the country accumulated all the cultural riches afforded by such a long history and was rightly considered one of the Middle East’s top destinations. Sadly, the war-ravaged nation is now struggling to preserve its ancient relics, which document the rise and fall of myriad civilisations. Like its history, Syria’s landscapes are varied. Vast steppes cover much of the country, but mountains soar in the west, deserts stretch in the east and volcanic fields spread across the south. Meandering through this dusty land is the great Euphrates River, which also flows through neighbouring Iraq. Syria was once regarded as a frontier region, bordered to the east by Persians and west by the Arabs. The country fell to the Persians in the sixth century and though it retained Christian and Jewish populations, Syria was from then on a Muslim nation. The country’s story is littered with dramatic episodes. Syria was subsumed by empires from Babylon to Canaan, Assyria to Phoenicia; it was conquered by the Ottomans, endured a campaign by Napoleon and was invaded by the Egyptians. During the height of pan-Arabism in the 1950s, the country briefly joined with Egypt in the United Arab Republic, but seceded to form the Syrian Arab Republic in 1961. The battles and territorial scrambles of the past have translated into a catalogue of staggering cities, such as Damascus and Aleppo, which are chock-full of stunning monuments and ancient mosques. The uprising against the ruling Baath Party in 2011 gave way to a civil war, which continues to rage and is further complicated by the formidable presence of the jihadist militant group Islamic State. Travel to Syria is ill-advised (it is probably the most dangerous country on the planet right now) and the future remains uncertain. 185,180 sq km (71,498 sq miles). 18,563,595 (UN estimate 2016). 92.2 per sq km. Damascus. Republic. President Bashar al-Assad since 2000.  Prime Minister Hussein Arnous since 2020.","The Syrian Arab Republic has been inhabited for tens of thousands of years and, as a result, has a rich cultural history. The area that is now the Syrian Arab Republic was part of the Empire of Mesopotamia around 2300 BC, during which time the cities of Ugarit (where the oldest written alphabet in the world is believed to have been developed) and Byblos grew to become powerful commercial centres. By about 500 BC, southern Syria had fallen under the control of Egypt, while the northern principalities had been welded into the Mitanni Empire. Within a few centuries, however, the Hittites from the north had overrun all of Syria, an empire that in turn collapsed in the face of invasions by the Mediterranean Sea peoples. The history of the following centuries, until the eventual destruction of the Kingdom of Judah in 539 BC, is one of a struggle by Babylonians, Canaanites, Assyrians, Phoenicians and many other tribes and empires for control of Syrian trade. Alexander the Great absorbed Syria into his empire in 333 BC; however, control of the region was disputed for the following two centuries  on this occasion, between the various people trying to gain control of his inheritance. For several centuries, the Province of Syria enjoyed the mixed blessings of the Pax Romana and was a province of the Eastern (Byzantine) Empire after the division of the Roman Empire. But even then, Syria was regarded as a frontier region, bordered to the east by the Arabs and Persians. The Persian invasions were repulsed but Syria eventually fell to the Muslims in the mid-seventh century. From then on, Syria was to be firmly part of the Muslim world, although retaining Christian and Jewish populations. Muslim control of Syria was vital to the defeat of the Christians and their expulsion from Jerusalem. However, during the 13th century, a far greater threat was the terrifying force of the Mongols. In the space of 50 years, they swept through Asia, creating an empire that stretched from Korea to Moscow. By 1260, they had overrun Syria and deposed the Abbasid Khalif. The Muslim world  and, indeed, the Christian one  seemed doomed. But in that year, the Mamluk General Baybars defeated the massive army of Hulagu at the Battle of Goliath's Well  a victory that, in retrospect, must be seen as one of the world's most decisive military engagements. By 1520, the region had fallen under the sway of the Ottoman Turks and, as a result, Syria prospered once  for the most part. The 19th century was a period of increasing restlessness in the area  Napoleon's campaign in 1799/1800, the Egyptian invasion in the 1830s and the insurrection in 1860-61 are three instances of this. The Turks were defeated in World War I and Syria was occupied by the French for a short time, before Syria was granted full independence in 1946. Three years later, the country came under the first of a series of military dictatorships that have governed the country for most of the subsequent period. As in the rest of the Middle East, Arab nationalism became a major political force during the 1950s  indeed, the influence of Nasser's revolution in Egypt on the Syrians was so strong that Syria joined Egypt in forming the United Arab Republic in 1958. The alliance was short-lived, Syria seceding in 1961, to form the Syrian Arab Republic. The most powerful political force in Syria since then has been the Ba'ath Party or Arab Socialist Renaissance (see Iraq), which seized power in 1971, under the leadership of General Hafez al-Assad, who ruled at the head of a tightly controlled dictatorship, until his death in June 2000. Assad's main power base was the Alawite group, a Muslim sect to which 10 per cent of the Syrian population is affiliated. With the tactical and strategic skill that was his trademark, Assad comfortably dealt with the challenges to his supremacy  largely through his control of the army and the country's myriad intelligence organisations. The major exception occurred in February 1982, when the Muslim Brotherhood  the principal opposition group confronting the Assad regime  launched a rebellion from the town of Hama. The rebellion was crushed, with several thousand deaths, by military forces led by Assad's brother Rifaat who then controlled the country's security forces. A few months afterwards, Assad then faced his most serious foreign policy challenge since the loss of the Golan Heights (an area bordering the Syrian Arab Republic and Israel) in the 1973 Arab-Israeli war, the Israeli invasion of Lebanon. The Syrian Arab Republic perceived Israel's strategy as establishing a Christian-dominated client state, underpinned by Israeli military power. The Syrian Arab Republic could not hope to match the Israelis militarily but Assad nonetheless managed to manoeuvre the Syrian Arab Republic into a dominant position in Lebanon. This he achieved by supporting the main Lebanese Muslim militias, Amal and Hezbollah, and then introducing a substantial military presence of its own, remaining careful to avoid direct confrontation with the Israelis (see Israel and Lebanon). In 1984, the Israelis moved into a self-styled 'security zone' south of the Litani River and in 1999, after a decade and a half of attritional guerrilla warfare with the Syrian-backed Hezbollah, the Israelis pulled out altogether. The Syrian Arab Republic, meanwhile, had established a political and military dominance over Lebanon, which continues to this day, although events in early 2005 - such as the assassination of the former Lebanese prime minister, Hariri, the UN Security Council and the USA's increasing pressure on Syria, and rallies on both sides - have prompted Syria to begin the process of withdrawing its troops, although it is not know how quickly or how thoroughly this process will be undertaken. Apart from anything else, their presence in Lebanon served to confirm that the Syrian Arab Republic was indispensable to a comprehensive settlement in the Middle East. The Syrian Arab Republic has yet to secure its main objective  the return of the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights  and has made clear that unless the issue is settled, the Syrian Arab Republic will not follow Egypt and Jordan in reaching a formal peace with the Jewish state. It is therefore uncertain whether Syria will be prepared to exit Lebanon entirely, when it is so key to their objective in Israel. There have been some discreet contacts between the Syrian Arab Republic and Israel in the last few years, most recently in early 2004. Israeli premier Ariel Sharon has invited President Bashar Assad to visit Israel, an offer which so far has not been accepted. The relationship between the two countries took a turn for the worse in 2005 over an alleged deal Syria was making with Russia to acquire missiles. The Syrian Arab Republic's relations with the West reached a nadir during the late-1980s, but the 1991 Gulf War came as an unexpected blessing, with the USA eager to attract Arab states into the anti-Iraqi coalition. Assad had been an implacable opponent of Saddam Hussein's Iraq from the beginning: the pan-Arab Ba'athist movement had suffered a fatal ideological split in the 1960s which has never been healed. The Syrians were happy to back the UN coalition and as part of the deal, they also secured substantial financial support and the guarantee of a free hand in Lebanon (which they still have, although, as aforementioned, this is subject to increasing contention and it is possible Syria may withdraw completely by later within the tear). In June 2000, after years of failing health, President Assad died. Having fallen out with his brother, Rifaat, some years earlier, and with the accidental death of his eldest son, Basil, in 1994, Assad had selected his second son, Bashar, as heir. While domestic policy has seen something of a relaxation under Bashar, Western hopes that the Syrian Arab Republic would pursue a more pro-Western line have proved misguided  in the vocabulary of the US Bush administration, the Syrian Arab Republic is a 'state of concern' (one level below the 'axis of evil'). The Syrians have provided some assistance to the Western 'War Against Terror' but were strongly opposed to the Anglo-American invasion of Iraq in 2003. Syria pulled its forces out of Lebanon in 2005, after coming under intense international pressure after being implicated by a UN report for the assassination of former premier of Lebanon, Rafik Hariri. Both Syria and Pro Syria Lebanese officials were thought to be involved although this has been strongly denied by Damascus.

middle-east,united-arab-emirates,"Comprised of little more than sand dunes, crumbling forts and fishing villages a century ago, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) has grown into a show-stopping, headline-grabbing destination which offers an intriguing blend of traditional Islamic culture and rampant consumerism.  Powered largely (but by no means exclusively) by oil wealth, the UAE today is defined by opulent resort hotels, ultra-modern architecture and a seemingly unending thirst for new and innovative mega-projects. Manmade islands in the shape of palm trees? Tick. Billionaire royals taking over Premiership football clubs? Tick. Tallest building on the planet? Naturally. Seven separate emirates make up the country, but visitor attention falls mainly on Dubai and Abu Dhabi. Both are home to an ever-growing spread of luxury accommodation, gourmet restaurants, branded nightclubs and gleaming shopping malls. Dubai’s most iconic sights include the sail-shaped “7-star” hotel Burj Al Arab, the Burj Khalifa skyscraper and the sea-themed Atlantis Resort, which are microcosms of the UAE’s lofty ambitions. The regular fountain show in the Downtown area rivals that of the Bellagio in Las Vegas, while vast shopping complexes like Dubai Mall (complete with one of the world’s largest aquariums) and Mall of the Emirates (complete with ski slope) are packed with premium international labels. Abu Dhabi, meanwhile, doesn’t have quite the same verve but boasts some remarkable attractions, from the Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque to the Ferrari World theme park. And in both destinations, there’s the option to delve into the UAE’s blend of Islamic culture and modernity, from spice souks to falcon hospitals. Meanwhile, the vast natural desert offers endless discoveries via exciting modes of transport from hot air balloon and quad bike to helicopter or sandboard. And don’t be dazzled by Abu Dhabi and Dubai alone – the other emirates are also worthy of exploration. Among them, coastal Fujairah offers nature walks and a host of outdoor adventures, including mountain biking and scuba diving, while Ras al-Khamiah has excellent off-road driving and hiking in the rugged Hajar Mountains. 83,600 sq km (32,278 sq miles). 9,269,612 (2016). 99 per sq km.

The Bedouin people traded with merchants from Iran, China and India before the arrival of Europeans in the 1400s. From the late 1400s, the Portuguese had control over much of the coastal emirates. But in an 1892 treaty, the sheiks that had control over what we now know as the UAE gave up much of their foreign relations power to the British government. Trading of the UAE’s ""black gold"" (crude oil) – the source of the country’s infallible wealth - commenced in 1962, after years of hardship that followed the downfall of the pearling industry in the 1930s. It was soon obvious that the British government could no longer administer and protect the emirates, so in March 1971 the treaties ended and the nine Persian Gulf sheikdoms began negotiations to form a union of Arab emirates. On 2 December 1971, Abu Dhabi and Dubai joined forces with four other emirates to form the United Arab Emirates. Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, the former ruler of Abu Dhabi, became the UAE’s first president. After he passed away in 2004, his eldest son, Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, took over and he has been president ever since. ● The Dubai police force use Lamborghinis and Ferraris so that they can catch speeders. ● Dubai has no address system and no postal codes.

The vast majority of Emirati nationals are muslims, approximately 90% Sunni and 10% Shia. The UAE follows a policy of tolerating existence of other religions, through the Ministry of Tolerance. Based on the latest Ministry of Economy census in 2005, 76% of the total population is Muslim, 9% Christian, and 15% are recorded as other (mainly Hindu). The UAE is an Islamic country and women may feel more comfortable when dressed modestly. Even though foreign women can dress as they please, covering the shoulders and knees is a requirement in public areas like shopping centres and also during periods of religious significance. Men are also expected to dress with respect. Homosexuality and adultery are both illegal and while non-married couples aren’t lawfully permitted to stay together in the same hotel room, it is common practice and rarely enforced. Alcohol is tolerated, with non-Muslims allowed to drink alcohol in the cities’ plentiful hotel bars and restaurants (except for Sharjah). Tourists are permitted to bring four litres of alcohol into the country, though under 20s are not allowed to drink alcohol or buy cigarettes. It is illegal for everyone to eat, drink or smoke in public during daylight hours of the holy month of Ramadan, and on the day or eve of days of national importance, alcohol isn’t sold and bars are shut. As in all Muslim countries, it’s best to keep displays of affection private – kissing or embracing in public is not only considered disrespectful, it could lead to police caution or even arrest. Holding hands is generally fine, but swearing, rude gestures and drink driving are all punishable by imprisonment. Drugs are a strict no-no and could land you in serious trouble. It’s worth checking what medicine and painkillers you bring into the country, as even some common pain medications like codeine are prohibited. Arabic is the official language.

The best time to visit is between October and April, when temperatures hover at a pleasant 25-28°C (77-82°F) and the Gulf is perfect for swimming. The hottest time of year is during the sweltering summer months of June to September, when humidity can seem unbearable and temperatures can skyrocket to 45°C (113°F). The country is well prepared for hot weather, however, with temperature controlled swimming pools and permanently air-conditioned hotels, malls, taxis and metros. Rain and wind can occur in January through March. Layering is your best bet; wear light clothing outside and bring a jumper or sweatshirt for the heavily air-conditioned buildings around the cities. During November to March, warmer clothes are advised for evening. A hat and high factor sun block is also advisable - a day on the beach in the strong summer sun is an easy recipe for sunstroke and sunburn.

Fujairah is the only Emirate that sits on the Gulf of Oman. The UAE covers an area of 83,600 sq km (32,300 sq miles), Abu Dhabi covers 87% of the country's land mass, which has a consistent terrain of mainly desert. It is home to native animals such as gazelles and the Arabian oryx, which was reintegrated into the area 40 years after it was hunted to extinction. Whilst 80% of the land mass is desert, other ecological terrain includes mountain areas and marine coastal areas.   The highest recorded point in the country is an unnamed peak stretching 1,910m (6266ft) high near the Jabal Bil Ays in Oman (but within the UAE border). The lowest point is at the Persian Gulf. The country only has 3.8% forest and woodlands due to the arid conditions. In an oasis is it common to find date palms, acacia and eucalyptus trees. Sand storms are common in the UAE, and this can cause traffic on the roads due to the poor visibility. Off the coast of Fujairah the waters are rich in calcium carbonate, and make the ideal breeding ground for coral reefs such as alveopora coral, African pillow coral, brain coral, raspberry-rice coral and more. The marine life in the area is rich due to these diverse coral formations and species in the area include Arabian carpet sharks, areloate groupers, black-finned melon butterfly fish, blacktip reef sharks, parrot fish and even whale sharks, which can be spotted by snorkellers and divers between the months of April and July."
middle-east,yemen,"If it were an authentic taste of Arabia that you're craving, Yemen was long the answer. An antidote to Arabian Gulf bling, this was long the peninsula's most fascinating destination. The largest city in Yemen, Sana'a is where most visits start. The Old City is UNESCO listed, its multi-storey tower houses and ancient Souk Al Milh lending an overwhelming medieval atmosphere. Being woken pre-dawn by competing muezzins from the city's fortyish mosques is a truly remarkable, unforgettable experience. Outside the capital, explore fortified cliff-top villages overseeing cultivated plains or hike the foothills of the Haraz Mountains. To the east, walk the shady streets of Shibam, Freya Stark's 'Manhattan of the Desert', where nine-floor mud towers stand testament to Yemeni building skills. On the coast, visit the bustling fishing ports of Al Mukalla or Al Huydaydah. Most remote is Yemen's 'Arabian Galapagos', the Socotra archipelago. Cast adrift at the mouth of the Gulf of Aden, Socotra is two hours by air from Sana'a; 37% of plant species, 90% of reptiles and an estimated 90% of invertebrates here are found nowhere else on earth. Once characterised as Arabia Felix (Fortunate Arabia) by the Romans and known as the land of milk and honey by Noah's sons, these days an uncertain security profile deters all but the hardiest travellers from visiting Yemen. In 2011, Arab Spring protests led to a revolution aimed at improving economic conditions and ending corruption. Unfortunately, the aftermath of the protests has been ever-increasing violence between different rebel factions and jihadists. When Yemen eventually recovers from this civil war, tourists will surely be drawn back to the land that the Queen of Sheba called home, and where Gilgamesh came in search of the key to eternal life. A country with such a rich history and culture, Yemen certainly deserves more than the present-day tragedy inflicted upon it. 527,968 sq km (203,850 sq miles). 27,477,600 (UN estimate 2016). 50.6 per sq km. Sana'a. Republic. Rashad al-Alimi, Head of the Presidential Council since April 2022. Prime Minister Ahmad Awad Bin Mubarak since 2024.","To the Romans Yemen was ‘Arabia Felix’ (‘Fortunate Arabia’), whose mountains and fertile plains caught the tail end of the Indian Ocean monsoon rains and were distinct from the barren desert of the rest of the Arabian Peninsula. However, there’s little that can be described as fortunate about modern Yemen. During the early 17th and early 19th centuries European powers and the Ottoman Empire struggled to control unruly Yemeni tribes and evidence of colonial legacies is visible across the country. In 1832 British East India Company soldiers captured the port of Aden, which provided a strategic staging post en route to the company’s territories in India. Britain split the country with the region’s other colonial power, the Ottomans, in 1904 and when that empire collapsed after WW1 its slice of Yemen gained independence until Arab nationalists acting with Egypt established the Yemeni Arab Republic in 1962 and precipitated a lengthy civil war. The British protectorate held out in the face of violent attacks until 1967 and the birth of the Marxist People's Democratic Republic of Yemen, before its union with the Yemeni Arab Republic in 1990 joined the two states under President Ali Abdullah Saleh. A suicide attack on USS Cole in Aden in 2000 killed 17 US personnel and was blamed on al-Qaeda in a foreshadowing of the 9/11 terror attacks, which saw Yemen stand with President Bush in his War on Terror. The inevitable Shia insurgency in Yemen began in 2004 and continues to this day, as the country is ripped apart by war. Saleh was ousted in the 2011 Yemeni Revolution and replaced with Abd Rabbuh Mansur Hadi resulting in the intensification of the Shia insurgency. Hadi was swept from power in February 2015 and enlisted the support of a coalition to fight back against Mohammed Ali al-Houthi’s newly declared Revolutionary Committee of Yemen. The situation remains volatile: the country faces permanent fragmentation as it teeters on the edge of failure. Did you know? •	The traditional sport of camel jumping involves men (women are not allowed to take part) competing to jump over the most number of camels from a standing start. •	Yemen is home to four UNESCO World Heritage Sites – the Old Walled City of Shibam in Wadi Hadhramaut, the Old City of Sana’a, the town of Zabid and the Socotra Archipelago. •	The average wedding feast in Yemen lasts 21 days. Sunni Muslim (especially in the north) and Shia Muslim, with some small Christian and Hindu communities. There is still a tiny Jewish minority. There are plenty of jokes about Yemeni hospitality, usually involving enforced stays in hidden mountain caves surrounded by armed men. However, with rare exceptions, Yemeni hospitality is traditional, courteous and generous. Yemen is a conservative Muslim country with all the prohibitions that this entails; women in particular should dress modestly and in some instances cover their hair. Mosques with the exception of certain times at Sana’a’s Al Saleh Mosque, and many Islamic holy sites, are off limits to non-Muslims; alcohol is forbidden to Yemenis and restricted to upmarket tourist hotels for foreigners. No such Islamic prohibition applies to qat. Pervading almost all strata of society, buying, chewing and waxing lyrical over narcotic qat leaves is a national obsession verging on addiction – everything stops for qat. Arabic. English may be understood by some in larger cities.","It’s generally accepted that the best time to visit Yemen and therefore the ‘high season’ falls between October and April, after the rains and before the intense heat of the summer. However, temperatures, humidity and rainfall all vary radically with altitude. The southern coastal areas see limited rainfall and are hot and humid year round, summer temperatures sometimes topping 54°C (129°F). The central highlands are hot in summer with average temperatures of 30°C (86°F), but winters are cold with frequent frosts. Average rainfall in the central highlands varies from 400mm to 750mm per year. Northern regions, and Wadi Hadhramawt, are hot and dry year round. Summer temperatures hover around the high 30s and it’s not uncommon to find areas where it hasn’t rained for years. That said, Wadi Hadhramawt suffered severe floods in 2008 which threatened to engulf the ancient mud city of Shibam. Lightweight clothes are worn in the coastal plain all year. Warmer clothes are needed from November to April in the highlands. The Republic of Yemen is bordered in the northwest, north and northeast by Saudi Arabia, in the east by Oman and in the south by the Gulf of Aden. To the west lies the Red Sea. The islands of Perim and Karam in the southern Red Sea are also part of the Republic. Yemen is predominantly mountainous, supporting terraced agriculture. The Hadramaut is a range of high mountains in the centre of the country. Highlands rise steeply in central Yemen, ranging in height from approximately 200m (656ft) to the 4,000m (13,123ft) peak of Jabal Nabi Shauib. In contrast is Tihama, a flat semi-desert coastal plain to the west, 50 to 100km (30 to 60 miles) wide. Surface water flows down from the mountains through the valleys during the rainy season and the area is cultivated for cotton and grain. In the east, the mountains drop away to the Rub al-Khali or 'Empty Quarter' of the Arabian Peninsula, a vast sea of sand. The arid coastal plains are fringed with sandy beaches."
north-america,united-states-of-america,"Known affectionately as the ‘Heart of Dixie’, Alabama thrills visitors with its fine antebellum architecture, white powdery beaches, hearty cuisine and rich sporting heritage. History nuts also have plenty to get their teeth into, from caves used by prehistoric Native Americans to the spot where Jefferson Davis became president of the Confederate States of America. In the 1950s and 1960s, Alabama was at the heart of the American Civil Rights Movement. Dr Martin Luther King Jr first preached at the Dexter Avenue King Memorial Baptist Church in Montgomery, and you can find sites commemorating the struggle across the state. Alabama’s landscapes are many and varied, ranging from mountains and forests to lakes and beaches. Take a road trip through sprawling farmland and plantation homes, hike the Appalachians or paddle some of the 2,600km (1,600 miles) of waterways, which meander through the state. Alternatively, head to the coast where watersports, wildlife and white sands await. Foodies can dig into good ole Southern fare, chomping slow-cooked hunks of barbecued meat, scooping up fresh-from-the-Gulf crab, or splurging on unpretentious gourmet dining in the bright lights of Birmingham. Alabama’s largest city is also home to the country’s oldest baseball stadium, built in 1910. Sport is huge in Alabama. Track and field star Jesse Owens was born here and the NASCA races at Talladega Superspeedway are world famous. The state also hosts the legendary Senior Bowl, an annual North vs South battle featuring the country’s top college football players. And if you like a good knees-up, Mobile has been celebrating Mardi Gras since 1703, longer than any other US city (yes, we’re talking about you New Orleans). 135,244 sq km (52,219 sq miles). 4.9 million (2015). 35.9 per sq km. Montgomery.","Prior to European settlement, Alabama was home to an indigenous population for thousands of years; first the Alabama people, followed by the Native American Cherokees, the Alabama, Chickasaw, and several other tribes. First settled by French in 1702, Alabama was controlled by many European powerhouses before becoming a US state in 1819. Alabama’s booming economy of the 1820s and 30s was heavily reliant on the vital cotton industry; with perfect land for the crops, this state was the centre for cotton growth, with large plantations across the state relying almost exclusively on slave labour. As the Civil War began, Alabama took the side of the south and conceded from the Union in 1861 to join the Confederate States of America. After putting up a fight, the Confederacy was defeated and the slaves on the cotton plantations across the state were freed by the 13th amendment to the US Constitution. They wouldn’t receive equal rights, however, for decades to come. After the Civil War, former slaves were still largely denied rights; they were unable to vote due to poll taxes or literacy requirements, inter-racial marriage was illegal, and schools were legally racially segregated. As inequality continued, the Alabama economy suffered from an agricultural depression and a boll weevil infestation that eliminated cotton as a viable crop. The lack of work and unfair conditions in the early 20th century forced many African Americans to move north for work in what later became known at the Great Migration. During the early 1920s the state diversified its economy and agriculture, especially cotton, faded into the background. Alabama now focused on the manufacturing industry, including automobile manufacturing and steel production. The Civil Rights Movement of the 1950s and 60s took a strong hold in Alabama, where inequality was especially prevalent. The efforts of activists were rewarded as the Jim Crow laws were repealed and the US Congress passed several acts that outlawed major discrimination based on race or ethnicity and imposing qualifications used to deny voting rights to African Americans. Since legal equality in Alabama, the population is booming and the newly diversified economy has taken off. Alabama’s cities Birmingham and Montgomery are major industrial hubs of the south and have solidified Alabama as a crucial part of American industry and history. Nestled in the midst of America’s “Bible Belt,” a vast majority of the Alabama population is Christian, and many Protestant, though the Southern Baptist Convention has a large following in Alabama as well. The state also has smaller populations of Jews, Muslims, and Buddhists, among other religions. As in many parts of the southern US, those in Alabama are incredibly polite with impeccable manners. ‘Ma’am’ or ‘Miss’ is usually used to address women and ‘Sir’ is used for men. Religion is a major part of culture in Alabama; considered the most religious state in the US, prayer and faith are a large part everyday life of the local culture. Alabama has an enormous sports culture; the University of Alabama football team, the Crimson Tide, is fervently beloved throughout the entire state. Tennessee, one of Alabama’s neighbouring states, is home to their fiercest and most detested rival, the University of Tennessee. English is official language and overwhelmingly the predominant language spoken throughout the state. The local dialects, however, vary between the northern and southern portions of Alabama.","Hot and humid in the summer months. Mild in winter months and cooler in the mountains. Temperatures range from highs in January of 10°C (50°F) and lows of 0°C (32°F), to an average high of 33°C (90°F) in July and a low of 21°C (70°F). Lightweight cotton clothing is recommend for the sultry summer weather. Warm clothing for evenings in the spring and autumn, and during the winter season. Waterproof clothing recommended year-round."
north-america,united-states-of-america,"Known, appropriately, as the Last Frontier, Alaska is a land of unfathomable natural beauty, a state so vast and wild that parts of it remain unmapped today. Everything about Alaska nudges the extreme end of the scale. The largest state in the USA, it boasts some 3 million lakes, 3,000 rivers, 100,000 glaciers and 17 of America’s 20 highest peaks. These untamed landscapes harbour a diverse range of wildlife, including Kodiak bears, giant moose and the iconic bald eagle, whose shrill call echoes the grandeur of this state. For adrenaline junkies, Alaska offers a big hit. Mt McKinley, the highest point on the continent, rises 6,194m (20,320ft) in Denali National Park and tempts climbers from around the world to tackle its snowy peak. Elsewhere, kayakers paddle beneath jumbo glaciers with humpback whales, while skiers and snowboarders whoosh up the Chugach Mountains by helicopter and glide back down on virgin powder. Sailors favour the legendary Inside Passage, a scenic coastal route that is becoming increasingly popular with cruise passengers, who can moor up at aboriginal villages and dock at the former Russian city of Sitka. Further afield anglers hunker down in rustic fishing lodges, hooking Pacific halibut and king salmon for supper. Whatever visitors come for, most kick off their trip in Anchorage, Alaska's largest city, home to 40% of the state’s population. But it’s not long before they are lured away from the lights and into the vast wilderness, which brings out the trailblazer in even the most sedentary traveller. 1,596,054 sq km (616,240 sq miles). 738,432 (2015). 0.5 per sq km. Juneau.","Alaska, the largest, yet least densely populated US state, was the 49th state admitted to the United States in 1959 after being bought from Russia in 1867. Alaska was home to many native groups including the Aleut, Tlingit and Eskimos. Russian traders were the first outsiders to reach Alaska and the first permanent settlement was established in the Three Saints Bay in on Kodiak Island in 1784. Russia gained a monopoly on the American fur trade and created the Russian-American Company. British merchants also began trading in Alaska and although banned by the Russo-American Treaty of 1824, so did Americans. As Russia’s hold on Alaska weakened throughout the 1800s, by the 1860s they were ready to sell the territory. The US duly obliged and splashed out $7.2m on the territory. In the 1890s, gold was discovered in the neighbouring Yukon Territory in Canada and an exodus of people flocked to nearby Alaska to join in the hunt. Then in 1899 gold was found in Alaska itself and an even larger influx of hopefuls joined the rush. A few years later in 1902 construction on the Alaska Railroad began, making transport from the lower 48 states to the Alaskan territory many days shorter and much easier. Industry also began to develop and commercial fishing took over as the leading industry. Alaska played its own part during World War 2 with Japanese troops occupying Attu and Kiska, two of the Aleutian Islands. US forces managed to expel the Japanese by 1943 and the federal government resettled those native peoples affected by the fighting. President Eisenhower signed Alaska into statehood in 1958 after the discovery of oil on the Kenai Peninsula. More oil was discovered in Prudhoe Bay in 1968 and the government began the construction of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline, which was completed in 1977. Ever since, tensions have run high between wildlife preservation groups against the expansion of the oil industry and those in favour of further development. Did you know? • Alaska once lived the same day twice. The state's transfer from the Russian Empire took place on 18 October 1867 (6 October in Russia where the Julian calendar was used) and its time zone changed from GMT +14 hours to GMT -10 hours, so enjoyed the same day twice. It’s the only place on Earth where this has happened. • The battle to liberate Attu Island in 1943 was the only action of World War 2 fought on incorporated territory of the US – nearly all the Japanese defenders, some 3000 men, were killed with only 28 prisoners taken. • Akutaq, the Eskimo ice cream, is made of seal oil, reindeer fat, dried fish and berries. Protestants make up the largest group in Alaska, though it is considered one of the least religious states in the United States. After Protestant, Catholicism, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and Southern Baptist are the next largest. The state also has a fairly large Eastern Orthodox population due to its early Russian colonization. Because Alaska is one of the newest states, they have a still developing culture; many residents are originally from other states. The native cultures also remain a large part of the Alaskan culture overall, with indigenous peoples comprising nearly 15% of the population in 2011. The “Eskimo kiss,” where two people rub the tips of their noses together, originated from a traditional native greeting known as a kunik, an expression of affection between friends and family that involves pressing the nose and upper lip against the cheeks. English is the official language of Alaska, but because of its large native population, several other languages, including Yupik and Inupik, are also spoken. There are also Spanish and Tagalog speaking areas around the state.","The climate varies widely throughout the state. Anchorage's summer weather is pleasant and the winters are mild. Fairbanks, the Interior and parts of the Bush region experience Alaska's most extreme weather conditions with average temperatures ranging from 22ºC (72°F) in high summer to -28ºC (-19°F) in winter. In the Anchorage area, a layered wardrobe is the best option, with a light jacket in summer and a warm coat in winter. Elsewhere, very warm winter clothing is required in the coldest months, and heavily insulated shoes. Lightweight and layered clothing is recommended during the summer."
north-america,canada,"Hulking great mountains, sprawling ice fields and emerald lakes are Alberta’s star attractions, but equally thrilling are its dinosaur-strewn Badlands and cowboy heritage. You’d swear they’ve added a drop of dye to the lakes in the Rocky Mountains. Could they really be such a startling colour? Yes they could, and you need to supercharge your camera battery if you’re going to capture every snap-worthy scene that comes your way. Whether you’re spotting grizzlies and elk alongside the Icefields Parkway, soaking in Banff’s hot springs, hiking around Maligne Lake or skiing fresh powder at Lake Louise, you’d have to be a Martian not to be bowled over. This pristine nature sits uneasily next to the controversial oil sands of Alberta’s north, whose modern-day gold rush has fuelled the province’s booming economy. This wealth is evident in cities like Calgary and Edmonton, home to shiny new skyscrapers, flashy restaurants and ever-expanding suburbs. While much of Alberta beyond the Rockies seems to be an endless vista of prairies topped with a generous sprinkling of lakes, the Badlands pop out like a Christmas cracker surprise. Stripy hills and sandstone hoodoos like giant mushroom stalks conceal many dinosaur bones – in its day this must have been the Cretaceous equivalent of Tokyo or Delhi. Get your own bones rocking at Edmonton’s summer fiesta, K Days, a 10-day jamboree featuring whirring fairground rides and big-name bands. Or join the cowboy extravaganza that is the Calgary Stampede, when chuckwagon races, bull riding and dazzling stage shows make you yee-haw till you’re hoarse. 661,848 sq km (255,541 sq miles). 4.1 million (2016). 5.77 per sq km. Edmonton.","First inhabited by the Paleo-Indians more than 10,000 years ago, the first European settlers arrived in Alberta circa 1750. The native population and the new arrivals, mostly either British or French, helped establish the area as a centre for the North American fur trade and trading opportunities ballooned with the arrival of the Canadian National Railway in Alberta in 1883. Within ten years, Alberta's non-native population swelled from about 1,000 to almost 17,500. Alberta was officially declared a province of Canada on 1 September 1905, named after Princess Louise Caroline Alberta (1848-1939), the fourth daughter of Queen Victoria and wife of the Marquess of Lorne, former Governor General of Canada. Edmonton was named its capital city.The early twentieth century was a period of boom and bust for Alberta as its fortunes followed the seismic economic shifts of the times. After World War II, the region was transformed forever with a major crude oil discovery Leduc, near Edmonton. The oil industry now became the main source of the province's economic prosperity and fuelled the region's urbanisation, as Edmonton and Calgary grew into centres of business and finance.Alberta has hosted a number of international sporting events over the years, including the 2005 Grand Prix in Edmonton and the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary. Although Canada is officially bilingual (English and French), English is more commonly spoken in Alberta.","Summer, between June and September, is warm, while winters are cold, with particularly heavy snowfalls in the Rockies. Spring and summer evening temperatures can be cool. Light to medium-weight clothing during warmer months. Heavyweight clothing and durable footwear is required in winter, with alpine wear in mountains. Waterproof wear is advisable throughout the year. Alberta is the most westerly of the 'prairie and plains' provinces, bordered to the west by British Columbia and the Rockies, and to the south by Montana. In the north, along the border with the Northwest Territories, there is a wilderness of forests, lakes and rivers. Mt Columbia on the western Rocky Mountains border is the highest point, rising to 3,747m (12,293ft). Alberta also has significant icefields. They release meltwaters which supply the Mackenzie River flowing into the Arctic Ocean, and the North Saskatchewan River flowing into Hudson Bay."
north-america,united-states-of-america,"A jewel in the USA’s crown, Arizona is a state of seemingly infinite possibilities; a place where you can hike from snow-capped mountains to the dusty depths of the Grand Canyon; where you can dance around campfires with Navajo tribesmen and rattle down Route 66 on a road trip to California. While the north of the state is criss-crossed with mountain streams and canyons, the south and west offer eye-catching deserts with stunning rock formations, Native American tribes and ramshackle ghost towns from Arizona’s mining days. Phoenix, the bustling state capital, boasts world-class cultural attractions, restaurants and shopping, not to mention a buzzing nightlife. It borders swanky Scottsdale, one of Arizona’s primary resorts, which is crammed with trendy hotels, spas and golf courses. Chock-a-block with students, Tucson is a hip and culturally vibrant city. Surrounded by rugged mountains, it has a lively nightlife, heavy Hispanic influence and distinctive downtown. Flagstaff, meanwhile, is the place for adventure, being as it is the gateway to some of the best hiking, biking and skiing in the state. And then there’s Sedona, a small city in Yavapai County surrounded by stunning sandstone formations and scented pine forests. For a taste of the Wild West, there’s the notorious, frontier town of Tombstone, which offers visitors the chance to stroll down its saloon-lined high street and watch re-enactments of the famous shooting at OK Corral. Of course, the Grand Canyon is the big draw, but dig deeper in Arizona, and you’re in for a treat. 295,253 sq km (113,998 sq miles). 6.8 million (2015). 23.1 per sq km.

The Mexican-American War began in 1846 because of the US annexation of newly independent Texas. At the end of the gruelling war in 1848, the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo outlined the purchase of modern-day California, New Mexico, Arizona, and several other states by the United States. In 1849, the California Gold Rush began, and as miners flocked in extreme numbers to the west coast hoping to hit it big, the effect of this influx was a large population boom in Arizona. Shortly afterwards, Arizona and New Mexico were consolidated into the New Mexico Territory, and a large strip of land was added to the area with the Gadsden Purchase in 1853. The New Mexico Territory joined the Confederacy during the Civil War, but the territory was regained by the Union in 1862 and after the end of the war, was split into two parts, creating the Arizona Territory. The Southern Pacific Railroad reached Arizona in 1880 and the Santa Fe Railroad reached the rim of the Grand Canyon in 1901. Both made Arizona a much more accessible destination and Tucson became a major railroad epicentre for the southwest. Arizona became the 48th and last contiguous state added to the US after President William Taft signed the statehood bill in 1912. A considerably liberal new state, Arizona women gained the right to vote that same year, eight years before the rest of the country. After WWII, Arizona’s population boomed, and Phoenix became a hot industrial and manufacturing centre for the state as agriculture quickly declined. The agreeable weather and low costs continued to attract new residents through the remainder of the 20th century, a large number being retirees from colder, northern climates. In the 21st century, Arizona has been in the headlines for their issues with illegal immigration from near-by Mexico. In 2010, the states passed Arizona SB 1070, a strict and strongly contested law that imposes harsh regulations and restrictions on aliens and immigrants. Today, Arizona is a popular destination because of the agreeable winter weather and the beauty of the local terrain, most famously the Grand Canyon, one of the seven natural wonders of the world. Arizona is predominately Christian, with the largest groups being Roman Catholic, followed by Evangelical Protestant. Other smaller groups include Jewish, Mormon, and Buddhist. Because Arizona recently passed the Arizona SB 1070 law which is considered the strictest law dealing with US immigration, many assume that all residents of Arizona are extremely conservative. Though Arizona does tend to vote conservatively in local and national elections, there is a growing liberal population across the state. English is the official language of the state of Arizona, though some city names (Yuma, Tucson, Havasu) are strongly influence by various Native American languages.","Mostly warm and comfortable all year round. Mountainous areas, such as Flagstaff at 2,134m (7,000ft), are colder, particularly in winter, and in summer, there are cool mountain breezes. Desert temperatures range from hot during the day to cold at night. Lightweight cotton clothing for all seasons, with a wrap for cool nights. Warmer clothing is needed in the mountains, especially in the ski areas."
north-america,united-states-of-america,"You may not know exactly where Arkansas is, but once you find it, this state will wow you with its phenomenal scenery and hidden hotspots. Not quite the Midwest, not quite the Deep South, Arkansas packs in rollercoaster mountains, thick forests, extensive plains, snaking lakes and meandering rivers. Outdoor adventurers can trek to remote cabins in the tree-swathed Ozark Mountains or paddle the Buffalo River by canoe, hurtling through white water and cooling off in natural swimming pools. The mountain town of Eureka Springs is the stuff of postcards, where photogenic Victorian homes cling to hillsides and a raft of stores, cafés and art galleries line the streets to relieve you of your dollars. For over a century, bathers have been taking rejuvenating dips in the thermal springs at Buckstaff Bath House in Hot Springs National Park. Neighbouring Superior Bathhouse is more watering hole than waterhole; it’s now a trendy brewery and distillery. Arkansas has its share of contemporary cultural institutions too. The swanky Clinton Presidential Center overlooks the Arkansas River in Little Rock and houses a library, museum and replica of the Oval Office. The Moshe Safdie-designed Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art in Bentonville sits amid 50 hectares (120 acres) of leafy gardens, and comes with its own Frank Lloyd Wright house (moved lock, stock and barrel from New Jersey). Arkansas also played a key role in the Civil Rights struggle, most famously in the case of the Little Rock Nine, a group of black students who enrolled in an all-white high school in 1957.

Little Rock.","The state of Arkansas gets its name from its first known inhabitants, the Quapaw people, also known as the Akansea people (meaning ""land of the downriver people""). The state was free of European influence until Hernando de Soto of Spain arrived in the mid-1500s, followed in the  late 17th century by French explorers during their exploration of the Mississippi river. Another Frenchman, Henri de Tonti, founded Arkansas Post as a base camp for expeditions, and created the first European settlement in Arkansas in 1686. Arkansas remained almost exclusively unsettled throughout the 18th century, although the French handed the Spanish control of Arkansas Post in the Treaty of Fontainebleau; this despite its significant location on the Mississippi River and as a hub for fur trappers and traders. In 1800, control of the Louisiana Territory (including Arkansas) was handed back to the French after Napoleon’s conquest of Spain and three years later, when England declared war on France, Napoleon sold the land to the United States in the Louisiana Purchase; an act which doubled the size of the US. The Territory of Arkansaw was granted statehood in 1836, and renamed Arkansas. Despite a highly developed agricultural system of corn, cotton, and grain plantations based on slave labour, the state’s economy was not strong enough to support government functions; the newly created state banks collapse after the nationwide recession, the Panic of 1837. The economy picked back up before the Civil War and the population of Arkansas was quick to secede and take up the cause of the Confederacy. The Union captured Little Rock, Arkansas, in 1863 and ended the Civil War in the state. Little Rock came to be the focus for the Civil Rights Movement during the Little Rock Nine event in 1957; Little Rock Central High school was being desegregated in compliance with the law, and residents in favour of remaining segregated crowded the school and blocked the path of nine black students from entering the school. President Dwight Eisenhower was forced to take control and protect the nine students from rioters. In more recent years, Arkansas has had a booming economy, with agriculture and manufacturing as the main industries, and the mining of natural gas and oil also boosting the economy. Bill Clinton, 42nd President of the United States, was also born in Hope, Arkansas and served as the Governor of Arkansas for nearly 12 years. Arkansas is located in America’s Bible Belt. Protestantism is the predominant religion, with other large denominations including Southern Baptist, Methodist, and Catholics. Because Arkansas is in the heart of the southern US, polite manners and generous hospitality are plentiful, but things tend to move a bit slower than in the north or the west coast. Try to adopt the local mindset and not hurry. Like many other states in the south, country and bluegrass music are popular in Arkansas. In the Ozark Mountains, the small town of Mountain View considers itself “The Folk Music Capital of the World.”  Famed country star Johnny Cash was also born in Kingsland, Arkansas. English is the official state language of Arkansas and spoken by the majority of the population. Some place-names in the state, like Choctaw and Ouachita, remain as a reminder of Native American influence in the region.",The region has the most continental climate of any area in the USA. Winters are cold and summers warm. Lightweights for the summer and layers for the winter.
north-america,belize,"Sandwiched between Mexico, Guatemala and the shimmering Caribbean Sea, Belize occupies a slice of paradise that is packed with culture, wildlife and a wondrous selection of historical sites. Much of the mainland remains swathed in jungle, where the vestiges of ancient cities punctuate verdant forest canopies. Caracol is the most famous. Its crumbling temples and stone pyramids stand as powerful reminders of the Maya civilisation. The history is fascinating for sure, but most people visit Belize to see its natural wonders and admirable conservation work; the Cockscomb Basin Wildlife Sanctuary was the first jaguar sanctuary in the world; the island of Half Moon Caye has been entirely dedicated to the conservation of birds; and the protected Belize Barrier Reef harbours an incredible array of marine life. Visitors can swim with sharks and stingrays along colourful walls of coral, or explore the Blue Hole, renowned as one of the world’s best dive sites. Numbering fewer than 335,000, Belizeans have surprisingly diverse roots: the country is a melting pot of Creole, Garifuna, Mestizo, Spanish, Maya, English, Mennonite, Lebanese, Chinese and East Indian heritage. Racial harmony, religious tolerance and a relatively peaceful political culture, have allowed these different elements to blend successfully and have given Belize a reputation as a friendly, laidback destination. Belize’s towns and cities are small and, on the whole, pleasantly unexciting. San Ignacio is a charming enough stop-off for those disappearing into the jungle and Punta Gorda offers insightful home stays with some of the country’s last remaining indigenous communities. The somewhat bland capital, Belmopan, however, is hardly worth going out your way for and bustling Belize City, though energetic and ruggedly charming, is used largely as a gateway to the islands. And what exquisite islands they are. Caye Caulker, Ambergris Caye, Cayo Espanto (to name a few) are everything you expect from the Caribbean and more; swaying palms, pellucid waters, sandy shores, ramshackle beach bars and charming restaurants.

The country has some spectacular and remarkably well-preserved ruins from this era and there are still some 30 Maya villages in the south of Belize, which retain a traditional way of life. Yet it is the British that have given the country its modern shape. They occupied the territory in 1638 and, by the end of the 18th century, had brought African slaves over to cut the country’s mahogany. Despite attacks from the Spanish, the settlers remained, although it was not until 1862 that the territory was recognised as a British colony, and named British Honduras. Belize achieved internal self-government in 1964 and elections the following year brought the leader of the People's United Party (PUP), George Price, to power. He presided over Belizean independence in 1981, but his party lost the 1985 elections to the United Democratic Party (UDP). Price was then returned to office in 1989. Tensions have long existed between Belize and Guatemala, because, even though the boundary between them was determined in 1859, Guatemala continued to claim sovereignty of Belize. Throughout the 1970s, British troops were sent over to deter Guatemalan invasion threats. In 1993 the British garrison withdrew and shortly afterwards, Premier George Price called a snap election. Despite expectations he was narrowly defeated by Manuel Esquival, the new leader of the UDP. The Belizean government has come under pressure from the USA for its alleged laxity in the 'War on Drugs' – Washington believes that Belize has become a major transit point for shipments into the USA, and for the laundering of drug profits through the country's banking system. Did you know? • Belize is the only country in the region with English as its official main language. • Belize’s Barrier Reef is the second largest reef system in the world, running the whole length of its coastline for some 174 miles (280 km). • Belize is thought to have been named after the British pirate Wallace, who formed the first settlement here. The people of Belize are mainly Roman Catholic (approximately 49.6% of the population). Approximately 27% is Protestant with a growing evangelical movement. There are growing Rastafarian communities along with smaller pockets of Islam, Buddhism, Hinduism, and Bahai. You can still see British influence in many social situations. Flowers or confectionary are acceptable gifts to give to hosts if invited to their home for a meal. Dress is casual, although beachwear should not be worn in towns. It may be inadvisable to discuss politics, particularly if of a partisan nature. Time is much more flexible here and any impatience towards the lack of punctuality will not be well received. You'll be asked to get onto Belizean Time. Gay travellers should be aware that male homosexuality is still illegal in Belize, and demonstrable homosexuality from either gender will not be looked upon well and could be dangerous for the traveller. English is the official language, but Spanish is spoken to some extent by over half the population. Garifuna (Carib), Maya and Creole are also spoken as well as a German dialect (by the Mennonites).","Belize’s climate is subtropical with a brisk prevailing wind from the Caribbean Sea. Annual temperatures and humidity are high. The temperature stays fairly constant year-round, varying by only about 4°C (7°F) from the hottest times to the coolest. Likewise the humidity remains throughout the year, though the higher you get into the Maya Mountains, the more comfortable the climate becomes. The dry season is from January to April and the rainy season is from mid-May until November. This results in overcast weather despite the heat, so it is not the best time to go for a beach holiday. The hurricane season is from June to the end of November – hurricanes have in the past devastated Belize. January is the coolest month and May is the hottest. Lightweight cottons and linens. A light shell jacket is recommended for the rainy season. Sandals or flip-flops will probably be your most useful footwear, but should you wish to do any hiking in the nature reserves you’ll need proper boots to protect your feet. Swimwear will also be necessary; if you plan to go snorkelling, having a top to wear in the water to protect your back from the sun is a good idea too. For generally being outdoors, a hat and sunglasses are required to prevent sunstroke. Long sleeved shirts and trousers are needed for protection against mosquitoes, which can be ferocious after dusk. Though higher-end places will provide one, it is recommended to take a mosquito net if you’re staying in budget accommodation. Although Belize is a tiny country, it has an astonishing range of geography. The Great Maya Barrier Reef runs alongside Belize's coast creating hundreds of small islands called cayes (keys) and offshore atolls, perfect for diving or snorkelling. From the centre of the country, stretching southwest into Guatemala and southeast to the coast are the Maya Mountains, a tropical broadleaf forest that is home to hundreds of different species. The two most northern districts are Corazol, which is flat terrain eventually turning into the forested hills and wild tropical jungle of Orange Walk. This sector is often referred to as the breadbasket of the country since it's primarily an agricultural area. The Belize district is home to the Northern Cayes. Ambergris Caye is the most developed and elegant resort area in the country while Caye Caulker has a more laid back atmosphere. Both are famous for their diving and snorkelling. Belize City has a mixed geography: to the north are the savannahs, to the west tropical jungle and to the south lagoons and mangroves. Western Cayo district is the largest county and is home to the Maya Mountains. Several rivers drop down from the mountain range, heading south, east and north making this a lush forested area filled with waterfalls, caves and Mayan ruins. The spectacular Hummingbird Highway traverses the northern edge of the mountains. Southern Belize has two distinct areas. Stann Creek rests on the eastern ridge on the Maya Mountain range where there are forested hills and pristine jungle ending at Dangriga on the coast, which gives way to the Central Cayes."

Summers in the province's interior are hot. Heavy snowfalls occur in the mountains. Lightweights for most of the summer, with warmer clothes sometimes necessary in the evenings. Mediumweights are worn during winter, with Alpine wear in the mountains. Waterproof clothing is advisable throughout the year. British Columbia is Canada's most westerly province, bordered to the south by the USA (Washington, Idaho and Montana states), to the east by Alberta, to the north by the Northwest Territories and the Yukon, and to the west by the Pacific Ocean and the 'Alaska Panhandle'. It is mainly covered by virgin forests, and encompasses the towering Rocky Mountains (rising to 3,954m/12,972ft), vast expanses of semi-arid sagebrush, lush pastures on Vancouver Island's east coast, farmland in the Fraser River delta, and fruitland in the Okanagan Valley. The highest mountain is Fairweather at 4,663m (15,298ft). Between the eastern and coastal mountains is a lower central range. The coastal range sinks into the Pacific, with larger peaks emerging at Vancouver Island and Haida Gwaii (Queen Charlotte Islands). The Columbia River flows from the Rockies into Washington State and out into the Pacific Ocean."

Everything glitters here; from the snow-capped Sierra Nevada to the sparkling sands of SoCal’s surf beaches, via the diamond-clad fashionistas of Rodeo Drive. Gold diggers, hippies, techie geeks, surf dudes and wannabe stars have all sought their piece of California’s good life, and its cities are hubs of aspiration and inspiration. Cosmopolitan San Francisco chucks eye-popping scenery and start-up ventures at you like a tennis ball machine. In Los Angeles, celebrity spotting in chic boutiques, exclusive restaurants, or even the gas station is a regular and fun occurrence.  California's ruggedly beautiful coastline curves north of Los Angeles along coastal Highway 1, an iconic American drive. At Big Sur, dramatic cliffs plunge into the Pacific Ocean where California grey whales migrate and condors soar overhead. Visitors come to hike through humongous redwoods, participate in the local artist scene, and escape anything manmade. Meanwhile, surfers and sun worshippers enjoy sand and swells along San Diego's sweeping shores. To the east, the Sierra Nevada is an extraordinary playground of sky-scraping mountains, towering sequoias and plummeting waterfalls. Skiers float through powder above Lake Tahoe, climbers inch up Yosemite’s El Capitan, and hikers trek the long-distance John Muir Trail. You can travel in the same day from Mt Whitney, the highest mountain in the lower 48 states, at 4,418m (14,494ft), to Death Valley, the lowest place in North America at 86m (282ft) below sea level.

Sacramento.","The history of California can be traced back to the Native American period before Christ. What's interesting about this time was how native people lived in an area surrounded by mountains, deserts and forests that isolated them from the rest of the world. These extreme living conditions led California's original inhabitants to develop unique cultures, which can still be seen today, as the state has the greatest native population of any in the US.In the 1700s, after Spanish explorers found no gold or cities to exploit, they left California to the missionaries and colonists who launched a campaign of genocide on the indigenous population. Mexico acquired the area in 1821 and built small ranches and used the indigenous population for labour. At the end of the Mexican-American War, the territory was handed over to the US government just in time for the California Gold Rush, which increased the area's population to over 100,000 by 1850. The increased population and promise of wealth helped make California an official state in 1850. From there, California began to boom and hasn't stopped since.The opening of the Panama Canal and the transcontinental railroad made California a shipping centre for the rest of the world, while advances in agriculture and farming opened up the state to successful cattle ranches and fruit plantations. With the first decades of the 20th century came the rise of the movie studios as MGM, Universal, and Warner Brothers bought cheap land in Hollywood to build sets and hired fresh faces from the Midwest as leading ladies. After World War 2, land developers began to build estates for soldiers who wanted to buy homes and start families. The 1980s were characterised by continuing economic boom as well as urban sprawl and air pollution. The state responded by passing clean air legislation and expanding carpool lanes. California can lay claim to being the birthplace of surfing, the movie business, hippies and the dot-com business boom with hi-tech companies based in Silicon Valley, including Google and Facebook. If California were a country in its own right it would be the sixth largest economy in the world and the 35th most populous. As it is, the population is growing as more and more people move to California for the weather, perceived job opportunities and laid back lifestyle. Did you know? • California is home to the highest (Pount Whitney) and lowest (Death Valley) points in the mainland United States. • In 1579 the English explorer Francis Drake claimed a section of the California coast, but it is no longer known where. • Some 37,000 earthquakes are recorded each year, although the vast majority are too small to be felt. California is the most populous state in the union and therefore has people practising a variety of religions. The state has the most Roman Catholics of any other state, as well as large Protestant, Jewish, and Muslim populations. California also has the largest Mormon population outside of Utah. Many Californians practise no religion, defining themselves as agnostic, atheist, or simply spiritual. California is known for a laid back and relaxed attitude with an emphasis on individuality. Southern California has an almost island feel to business and social dynamics, with a less strict emphasis on time and appearance. English is the official language. Spanish is spoken widely, especially in urban centres and near the Mexican border. Many advertisements, public announcements, and commercials are in English and Spanish.","Summers are very warm, with cool evenings, while the spring and autumn months are mild, with cool evenings. The winter 'rainy season' is gentle and occurs between January and March. Much of the state has a Mediterranean climate, with hot, dry summers and mild, rainy winters. San Francisco is known for its characteristic fog in spring and early summer. Northern California and the high mountains have snow in winter, while the deserts experience very hot summers and mild winters. For the best skiing in Lake Tahoe, the end of January and the beginning of February offer good snow and a break from the swelling crowds at Christmas and through mid-January. For prime sunny beach weather in Southern California, July and August offer lots of sun and heat, but there will be crowds. Avoid the “May Gray” and “June Gloom,” which bring a low-lying marine layer of clouds over the coastline for most of the day. Lightweight during the summer with warmer wear for the cooler winter period. Hiking boots and gear are needed for more adventurous mountain climbing and hiking in Yosemite and parts of Joshua Tree. Skiing in Lake Tahoe is warmer than most mountains, so dress in layers, and don’t be surprised to see skiers show-off in t-shirts. Beachwear is acceptable in restaurants and shops near the beach, but shirts and shoes are required by law. Men should not wear shorts away from the beach. Los Angeles is a fashion-conscious city, especially for women and dressier clothes are required for many nightclubs and restaurants. Men don’t have to wear formal suits, but shirts and trousers are standard. California is a geographically diverse area of the USA. The state is usually divided into Northern and Southern California, though there are isn’t a well defined boundary. San Francisco is a northern city, while San Diego and Los Angeles are southern, but the areas in between aren’t easily defined – rather, the distinction is more between the differing attitudes and lifestyles in different areas, than a physical boundary. Southern California is generally a developed urban environment, with major cities and sprawling suburbs accessible only by car. Northern California is more rugged and natural, with vineyards, mountains, and agricultural regions. California is bordered to the north by Oregon state, to the east by the states of Nevada and Arizona across the Colorado River, to the south by Mexico, and to the west by the Pacific Ocean. Earth scientists have divided the state into eleven distinct mountain ranges, plateaus, deserts, basins, and valleys. The most notable mountains are the Sierra Nevada range which run north-south for 640 km (398 miles) and contain the highest peak in the United States: Mount Whitney. The Mojave Desert contains the lowest and hottest place in America: Death Valley, where the temperatures hover around 49°C (120°F). in mid-summer. Earthquakes are a regular (but rarely deadly) occurrence throughout the state, especially near San Francisco."

The world’s second-largest country (by total area) racks up an astonishing diversity of landscapes; the vast Canadian Prairies rise abruptly to the glacier-topped Rocky Mountains; rugged, unspoiled coastlines give way to immense forests and emerald lakes; and Arctic waters lap upon frozen tundra. Incredibly, this wilderness is also home to cosmopolitan cities, quirky towns and remote indigenous settlements. Canada’s people are as varied as the landscapes; from the Arctic Indigenous peoples and the Francophone Quebeckers to the British expatriates and burgeoning Asian community, this is a multicultural land where around 22% of the population are foreign-born. Canadian cities are progressive, vibrant and regularly feature on lists of ""best places to live"". Toronto, a veritable patchwork of charming neighbourhoods, has an idyllic beachside location on the shore of Lake Ontario, while Canada’s capital city, Ottawa, contains a clutch of fantastic museums and the gorgeous Rideau Canal for ice skating in winter.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau since 2015.","The Indigenous peoples were the original inhabitants of Canada and are formed of three categories: Inuit, First Nations and Métis. The Indigenous population eventually began to decline as a consequence of Europe's colonisation. A large portion of people died of European diseases they lacked immunity to such as influenza and measles. The first Europeans believed to reach Newfoundland were descendants of Norse seafarers who had settled in Iceland and Greenland during the ninth and 10th centuries; the second wave of European arrivals, led by the Italian navigator Giovanni Caboto (better known as John Cabot), were seeking a passage to Asia, in 1497. Over the next 100 years, attracted by rich fishing grounds, English and French commercial interests flocked to Newfoundland. During the 17th century, the French accelerated trading with the New France Company. The creation of England's Hudson's Bay Company initiated a long period of rivalry, culminating in the Anglo-French Seven Years' War of the late 1750s to early 1760s; this ended with the surrender of the French-Canadian capital, Quebec, to the English forces. The Treaty of Paris, in 1763, gave all French territories in northeast America to the British. Within two decades, however, the English had been ousted from their American colonies following defeat in the American War of Independence. Eastern Canada was then settled by loyalists from the USA holding allegiance to the defeated British Crown. In 1791, Canada was divided between regions occupied by the English-speaking and the longer-established French-speaking community, but the arrangement did not work and was replaced by a unified system. In the mid-19th century, Canada was granted the status of a Dominion by the British Empire, with an autonomous government but with the British monarch as head of state. From 1968 to 1984, politics were dominated by the charismatic figure of Pierre Trudeau. Brian Mulroney was elected in 1984, and the Quebec issue (referring to the Quebec sovereignty movement) came to the fore once more. A 1995 referendum in Quebec resulted in an extremely narrow vote in favour of remaining inside Canada, although in 2006 the Canadian parliament agreed the Quebecois should 'form a nation within a united Canada'. In 2015, Justin Pierre James Trudeau followed in the footsteps of his father and was named 23rd prime minister of Canada. As leader of the Liberal Party, Trudeau Jr. built a cabinet from an equal number of men and women, starting a trend towards a new liberal form of politics. Virtually every Trudeau initiative, from tax policy to legalising marijuana, has been at odds with the previous Conservative administration. 2017 marked the 150th anniversary of the Canadian Confederation and the country celebrated this sesquicentennial with a series of special events over the course of the year. Around 67% of the population belong to the Christian faith; most are Roman Catholic, followed by the United Church of Canada and Anglican denominations. There are numerous other active denominations and religions including Island, Hinduism and Sikhism. Handshaking predominates as the normal mode of greeting. Close friends often exchange kisses on the cheeks, particularly in French-speaking areas. Codes of practice for visiting homes are the same as in other Western countries: flowers, chocolates or a bottle of wine are common gifts for hosts, and dress is generally informal and practical according to climate. It is common for black tie and other required dress to be indicated on invitations. Exclusive clubs and restaurants often require more formal dress. Smoking has been banned in indoor public areas in all provinces except Alberta. Canada is officially bilingual (English and French). The use of the two languages reflects the country's mixed colonial history - Canada has been under both British and French rule. However, while the federal government must operate in both languages as much as is practical, use of each language outside government varies widely across the country. In almost all of the province of Quebec, as well as parts of New Brunswick, French is the dominant language; in most of the rest of the country, English dominates. Montréal, Ottawa and Moncton have large concentrations of fluently bilingual people. Immigration has also changed the language picture considerably; while not official languages, Chinese, Punjabi, Arabic and other languages are often heard on the streets of Canada's largest cities.","If you’re planning on skiing or enjoying winter sports, the best time to visit Canada is between December and April, though some resorts open as early as November and extend their seasons as late as June (or even July on Whistler’s glacier). If you want to enjoy the great outdoors without the snow, travel between May and September. Be aware, however, that if there’s been heavy snowfall during the winter, some high-altitude hiking trails may be closed well into July. Summer thunderstorms are common throughout Canada. Occasionally, these may become severe. Tornados also occur throughout Canada, with May to September being prime months. The tornado-prone areas include most of Alberta, southwestern Quebec, and a band stretching from southern Saskatchewan through to Thunder Bay in Ontario. The interior of British Columbia and western New Brunswick are also tornado zones. Earth tremors occur in the western mountains. Forest fires can occur at any time, regardless of the season, particularly in the grasslands and forests of western Canada. Note: These general guidelines apply mainly to the settled areas of southern Canada. Travellers heading to northern areas, such as the Yukon, the Northwest Territories, Nunavut and Labrador, should bring warm clothing for all but the summer months (and even in summer, at least a lightweight jacket is advisable). See the individual provinces and territories sections for more details. Winter (Dec – Feb): Winter temperatures. Winter clothing is necessary (e.g. overcoat, hat, boots and gloves). Most provinces experience heavy snowfall, with Vancouver being the main exception in that it usually rains instead. Spring (Mar – May): Moderate temperatures. Medium weight clothing with a waterproof topcoat or umbrella is the recommendation. Summer (Jun – Aug): Warm temperatures. Lightweight summer clothing with some medium weight clothing for cool evenings. Autumn/ Fall (Sep – Nov): Cool, with the first frost in the air. Medium to heavyweight clothing is recommended, particularly with the first signs of snow in November. Canada is the second-largest country by total area in the world after Russia, covering an area of 9,984,670 sq km (3,855,100 sq miles). It is bordered to the west by the North Pacific Ocean and Alaska in the northwest, to the east by the Atlantic Ocean, to the north by the Arctic Ocean, to the northeast by Greenland (across the Nares Strait), and to the south by the 'Lower 48' states of the USA. The polar ice cap lies to the north. Canada stretches 4,634km (2,879 miles) from its northernmost point on Ellesmere Island, Nunavut to its southernmost point on Middle Island, Lake Erie, Ontario. The longest distance east to west is 5,514km (3,426 miles) from Cape Spear, Newfoundland and Labrador to the Yukon-Alaska border. Canada also has the world’s longest coastline at 202,080km (125,567 miles). The country’s highest mountain, with a peak at 5,959m (19,550ft), is Mount Logan in the Yukon Territory. The landscape is diverse, ranging from the Arctic tundra of the north to the great prairies of the central area. Westward are the Rocky Mountains, and in the southeast are the Great Lakes, the St Lawrence River and Niagara Falls. The country is divided into 10 provinces and three territories."

Known as the Centennial State, Colorado is perhaps most famous for its beautiful Rocky Mountains, which are quite literally the backbone of the state. Colorado’s capital, Denver, is a city you wish you could move to, set upon high rolling plains with a spectacular mountain backdrop. It’s home to a buzzing arts scene and beautifully restored Victorian architecture. But if you think Denver is cool, wait until you visit hip-and-happening Boulder. Here you can hike towards the famous Flatirons that overlook the city, chill out in one of the city’s parks or cafés, cycle around like a local, enjoy a night out on the Hill amid partying students or take in one of many film and music festivals.

Spanish explorers were the first Europeans to work their way to present-day Colorado, though they never formed any long lasting settlements in the area. A permanent settlement wasn’t established until trading posts were created by traders and trappers along the Arkansas River in the mid-19th century. When the US won the Mexican-American War in 1848, the southern portion of the Rocky Mountains (including parts of Colorado) were opened for American settlement. The first permanent European town, San Luis, was established by Hispanic settlers in 1851. Like many other territories in the region, Colorado witnessed a population boom in the wake of the California Gold Rush in 1849 and 1850. Initially, no gold was found in Colorado and gold seekers overlooked this state for the western coast. Those who stayed however, had their patience rewarded, as in 1859 gold was found, along with silver and minerals, throughout the Rocky Mountains. The Territory of Colorado was created in 1861. Until that point, modern-day Colorado had been divided between the territories of Kansas, New Mexico, Utah, and Nevada. Colorado became the 38th state after President Ulysses S. Grant signed the territory into statehood in 1876. As the 19th century progressed, Colorado became one of the major mining hubs of the US. Silver, gold, and mineral mining was rich throughout the state, and the continued discovery of gold fields drew people, goods, and services from far and wide. Due to Colorado’s wealth in metals, the US Treasury established a money mint in the capital, Denver, in 1906; it is still in operation today. In the 20th century, the mining boom died down as deposits of metals and minerals dwindled across Colorado. The state’s focus shifted to manufacturing and industry to boost the economy, and a huge influx of workers flowed into the state’s growing cities. Today, Colorado is one of the US’s best states for business, home to federal facilities, a booming agricultural industry, and a rich industrial industry. Christianity is the most popular religion in Colorado, with the majority of the population being Roman Catholic, followed by Baptist. There are also small populations of Jews, Mormons, and Muslims, among other religions. Many residents are quite laid back and enjoy nature, which has contributed to the often-resented concept of Colorado as a haven for “hippies.” In the 2012 election, Colorado voted to legalise recreational marijuana use for adults, further contributing to the “hippie” stereotype.   A large ski culture exists in Colorado, revolving around the Rockies and the countless ski resorts in the state. Residents are often given discounts on lift passes and season passes. English is the official language of Colorado, and is the predominantly spoken language across the state. Additionally, in recent years the state has witnessed a rapidly growing Spanish-speaking population.","The capital, Denver, has a mild, dry climate with an average of 300 sunny days a year. Spring is mild, with warm days and cool evenings; summer has very warm days with low humidity and cool evening breezes. Denver often enjoys an Indian Summer right into November, while winter is cold, sunny, and crisp, with an average snowfall of 1,397mm (55 inches). The mountains boast warm summer days with cool evenings. Autumn arrives early in the high ground, with abundant snowfall from December to April and temperatures around freezing point. Extra warm clothing, especially in the mountains, from November to March/April. Cottons and linens during the summer months, and usually a light jacket at night."

Hartford.","Dutch explorers were the first to touch ground in modern day Connecticut, and by 1623 were regularly trading with the local Native Americans. After signing the Treaty of Hartford in 1650, the Dutch withdrew, leaving room for the expanding English colonies to take hold of the region. Over a century later Connecticut was one of the 13 colonies that aided in the overthrow of the Crown in the American Revolution. With the colonies having won their independence, the state’s economy flourished as sea ports grew and textile factories were built. During the Civil War, Connecticut played a main role in supporting the Union to a victory over the southern Confederacy. Because it was a haven for manufacturing and industry, the state supplied ammunition and weapons to the troops, and many residents fought for the Union army. In the wake of the Civil War, Connecticut abolished slavery entirely in 1848; however, like many northern states Connecticut had gradual emancipation measures in place as early as 1784. In the early 18th century Connecticut became a destination for immigrants across the globe. Italian, Polish, and Eastern Europeans flocked to the small New England state and brought with them an unskilled and largely Catholic labour force. Like the rest of the country, Connecticut suffered after the stock market crash of 1929, but during WWII manufacturing picked up once again and the state became a leader in munitions manufacturing, with industries for rifles, engines, and countless other items. Urbanization took hold in the mid-1900s, as the rich elite moved to suburban areas and crime and drugs took hold of the state’s urban areas. As the 20th century progressed, the crime rates lowered throughout the state. Today, Connecticut has one of the highest per capita incomes in the US, and the agricultural industry is booming, with fish, cattle, and tobacco being some of its major products. The majority of Connecticut is Christian, with the largest group Protestants. There are also large groups of Roman Catholics and non-religious residents. A small number of Jewish, Mormon, and Muslim people reside in Connecticut as well, along with other religious groups. Yale University, one of the eight Ivy League universities, is located in New Haven, Connecticut. Every other year, Yale hosts the fiercely cutthroat football game between Yale and Harvard University in Massachusetts. Connecticut residents, and especially Yale alumni, are highly competitive about the outcome of the game. New England is infamous for its aggressive drivers, and Connecticut is no different. If you’re on the road in this state, always be aware and have your eyes on the road!","Connecticut has long, hot summers and cold winters. In winter, temperatures generally average -4 to -1°C (24 to 30°F). Summer temperatures average from 20 to 22ºC (68 to 72°F). Cottons, linens and a light jacket for the summer months. Heavyweight clothing with extra bundling for the winter months."
north-america,costa-rica,"Steaming rainforest, iridescent hummingbirds, smouldering volcanoes, tumbling rivers, and miles of palm-fringed sandy beaches: if Mother Nature can ever be accused of showing off, it is in Costa Rica. Sat just north of the equator, this verdant chunk of the Central American isthmus is one of the most bio-diverse spots on the planet. Added to this, as the only country in the region with no standing army, Costa Rica is a beacon of peace and democracy. A world pioneer in eco-tourism, Costa Rica has set aside more than a quarter of its territory as a protected natural area. Its 28 national parks are its greatest glory, comprising a stunning variety of landscapes, microclimates, flora and fauna. The forest canopy at Los Quetzales National Park is the haunt of the colourful resplendent quetzal (Pharomachrus mocinno), the sacred bird of the ancient Mayans and Aztecs. The Las Baulas National Marine Park is home to the world's largest nesting ground of leatherback turtles. The Rincón de la Vieja Volcano National Park is alive with bubbling fumaroles and commanding waterfalls, making it a fantastic place to enjoy hiking, horseback riding, or simply having a soak in hot springs to soothe body aches. Alternatively, if you are looking for an adrenalin kick, diving, surfing, rock climbing, whitewater rafting and tree-top ziplining are just a few of the extreme activities on offer. You can also hike around the country – choose from easy countryside rambles to epic coast-to-coast hike that takes you from the Caribbean side to the Pacific coast. Costa Rica's cities may not win many architectural awards but they do offer a rich insight into the urban lives of Ticos, as the citizens call themselves. The capital, San José, has superb museums, specialty coffee shops and craft beer bars, while Puerto Limón, overlooking the Caribbean Sea, has a multi-ethnic flavour. Limón is also a popular stopover with surfers en-route to the big waves at Salsa Brava. All in all, for those in search of an ethical adventure, Costa Rica's charms will have you under its spell all too quickly. 51,110 sq km (19,730 sq mi). 5.094 million (2020). 100 per sq km. San José.

The modern history of Costa Rica started in 1502 when Christopher Columbus landed in Cariay (near present-day Isla Uvita) during this fourth expedition, although the Spanish settlers largely ignored the land until 1564. Costa Rica gained its independence from Spain in 1821. Initially, it exchanged one form of colonial rule for another, being absorbed first by Mexico and subsequently as part of a new United Provinces of Central America. Costa Rica finally became an independent country in 1838. Throughout the 20th century, Costa Rica enjoyed peace and steady growth in prosperity, with the notable exception of a civil war in 1948 following a disputed presidential election. Significantly, however, Costa Rica disbanded its military forces after the civil war and still today remains the only country in the region with no national army or military prescription. Did you know? • In the 1930s, hundreds of stone spheres were found in the Diquís Valley of Costa Rica. How and why they were made remains a mystery. Today, some of the stones are displayed in the National Museums. • Costa Rica's primary airport is named after Juan Santamaría Rodríguez, a national folk hero who helped defeat a North American freebooter named William Walker in 1856. • The strawberry poison dart frog is one of Costa Rica's tiniest and most colourful creatures; it can change colour from red to green to blue to confuse predators. Christians make up 90% of the population, of which 62% are Catholics. About 9% of the population is atheistic. Costa Ricans refer to themselves as Ticos (men) or Ticas (women). The word tico comes from the usage of 'tico' diminutives in Spanish. For example, when saying something small, like ""a little moment"", Costa Ricans use ""momentico"" as opposed to ""momentito"". Costa Ricans are friendly and polite; they greet each other with a handshake (between men) or a kiss (between women who are familiar with each other). One's family is perhaps the most crucial part of life for most Tikos. In respect of this, reputation is important and loyalty is expected. Usual courtesies should be observed when visiting someone's home and gifts are appreciated as a token of thanks, especially if invited for a meal. Spanish is the official language, while English is widely spoken. In some parts of the Caribbean coast, Creole is spoken.","Located around 10° north of the Equator, Costa Rica enjoys a tropical climate year-round. Costa Rica’s Pacific coast Divided into North Pacific, Central Pacific and South Pacific regions, this long stretch of coastline attracts many visitors to its sandy beaches and secluded coves. December to March is the best time to visit Costa Rica's Pacific coast, particularly the northern and central parts, as this is the dry season with the most sunshine. As you move further south, the dry season becomes less defined. In other words, there are rainy days even during the dry season. May to October is the wet season along the Pacific Coast, so expect hot and humid weather, which can be uncomfortable to some travellers. April is generally the warmest month, while December is the coolest month. In the coastal town of Puntarenas on the Gulf of Nicoya, the average high ranges from 27-29°C (81-84°F) year-round except in April, when the mercury often climbs above 30°C (86°F). The Osa Peninsula (Peninsula de Osa) on Costa Rica's South Pacific Coast has an average high of 28°C (82°F) throughout the year. The central valley and San José Spanning from San Ramón (Alajuela province) in the west to Paraíso (Cartago province) in the east, Costa Rica's central valley is the setting for the country's capital, San José. Sitting at 1,172m (3,845ft) above sea level, San José has a tropical climate with warm days and cool nights. The best time to visit San José is from January to March when the weather is warm and has little rain. The rain starts from May and lasts till October, with September being the wettest month. April is usually the warmest month with an average high of 30°C (86°F) and an average low is 19°C (66°F). Costa Rica's Caribbean coast Stretching from Barra del Colorado in the north to Sixaola in the south, Costa Rica's Caribbean coast receives heavy rainfall throughout the year with no distinct dry season. Hurricanes may also affect the Caribbean coast, especially in October and November. February, March and September are widely considered to be the best time to visit Costa Rica's Caribbean coast – these are the 'dryer' months, although you may still get fourteen to seventeen rainy days in a month. Limón, or Puerto Limón, is the largest city on the Caribbean coast. It has a tropical rainforest climate with an average high of 30°C (86°F) year-round. In other words, it is hot and humid. Lightweight cottons and linens are fine most of the year, with warmer clothes for cooler evenings. Waterproofing is necessary during the rainy season. Loose-fitting clothing is best. Wear neutral browns and greens for birding and wildlife viewing. Always bring mosquito repellent, along with appropriate footwear for whatever activities you're planning. Check the weather forecast before leaving for your trip. Located on the Central American isthmus, Costa Rica borders the Pacific Ocean to the west, the Caribbean Sea to the east, Nicaragua to the north and Panama to the south. Costa Rica sits along the Pacific Ring of Fire. Volcanoes, both active and dormant, run from the northwest to the central valley and continue onwards to the southeast. The Central Volcanic Mountain Range draws the most visitors, as it features Arenal (which erupts from time to time) and Irazu (the country's highest volcano). About 45km (28mi) west of Irazu is San José, the country's capital. Costa Rica's highest peak is Cerro Chirripó (3,821m or 12,536ft), which is part of the Talamanca Range in the southeast. From the summit, you can see the Caribbean Sea and the Pacific Ocean on a clear day. Along both coastlines, lowlands, wetlands, and miles of sandy beaches backed by dense tropical rainforest are the defining characteristics."
north-america,united-states-of-america,"Tiny Delaware is a blink-and-you’ll-miss-it state for drivers heading down the East Coast, but turn off the highway and this pocket-sized region packs in glorious beaches, rambling historic estates and enticing tax-free shopping. Fronting a broad sweep of sand peppered with parasols, Rehoboth Beach Boardwalk is a classic Atlantic seaside spot, humming with whirring arcades, pizzerias chock-full of chattering families, and confectioners spooning out caramel popcorn and a rainbow assortment of salt water taffy. A little to the south, Bethany Beach welcomes more than 100 artisans to its boardwalk each September for an arts festival showcasing everything from jewellery to watercolours. And right by the Maryland border, Fenwick Island’s waves lure windsurfers, while kayakers paddle the still waters of Little Assawoman Bay before filling up on all-you-can-eat steamed crabs. Delaware was the first state to ratify the United States Constitution, back in 1787, and Lewes became the first town in the first state. You can cruise along the canal front by bike or explore Cape Henlopen State Park’s swimming beaches, nature trails and WWII observation tower. Away from the coast, the sprawling homes and elaborate gardens of the du Pont family have more than a whiff of French châteaux about them. The family originally emigrated from France in 1800, establishing a gunpowder works along the Brandywine Creek in Wilmington and thus making their fortune. You can save a fortune too in Delaware: tax-free shopping is as big a draw as the beach, and outlet malls and upmarket shopping centres tempt you to spend big on clothes, computers and, well, anything that’s going to persuade you to part with your cash. 6,206 sq km (2,396 sq miles). 945,934 (2015). 152.4 per sq km. Dover.","The Swedes were the first to formally colonize what is modern-day Delaware in 1638, after wresting control from the Dutch West India Trading Company, who had established posts for trade with the local Native Americans. The Swedish fort was near modern-day Wilmington and dubbed Fort Christina. Before long, the English laid claim to Delaware and led by James the Duke of York, took control of the region in 1664; he administered Delaware from his other colony, New York. A century later, Delaware became of the 13 colonies that rebelled against the English crown, and the three counties of Kent, Sussex, and New Castle became known as Delaware. The colonies won their independence in 1776, and in 1787 created the US Constitution. Delaware was the first state to ratify the document, giving them the nickname of “The First State.” The Du Pont family, founders of E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company, called Delaware their home after immigrating in 1800. Historically one of America’s richest families, the Du Pont’s company produced gun powders and chemicals, all manufactured at a plant near Wilmington. Today, E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Co. is still one of the largest employers in the state.  During the Civil War, however, Delaware, though a slave state, sided with the Union. However, once the north won the war, Delaware did not abolish slavery like the majority of the north. The state also voted against the eventually successful 13th amendment that abolished slavery nationwide in 1865. In the early 1900s, Delaware’s agriculture expanded, and corn and wheat crops flourished, along with soybeans and poultry. Their agriculture is still today a huge industry and large supporter of the state economy. During WWII, Delaware’s manufacturing industry improved and expanded as they produced ships, chemicals, and airplanes for the Allied forces. In the 1970s, Delaware’s economy took a downward turn, but was quickly revived as Governor Pierre S. du Pont IV (of the Du Pont family) decreased state spending and business taxes, which drew many companies including Fortune 500 and banking, to Delaware. Delaware is mostly Christian, with Roman Catholics and Evangelical Protestants composing the largest groups. Delaware is also home to the oldest Protestant church in the country, Old Swedes Holy Trinity Church built in 1698. The three counties of Delaware were once individual entities, and the local pride carries through today. Though Delaware is now a single unit, residents of Kent, Sussex, and New Castle have very strong local pride and tradition. The Lenape, or Delaware, tribe originally resided in Delaware, and their ancestors still live there today. They have many customs and traditions that have survived into current culture, and their history is a celebrated part of Delaware’s culture.Language in DelawareEnglish is the predominantly spoken language in Delaware, though they have not declared an official language. Few people speak other languages, but like the rest of the US, they have a climbing Spanish speaking population.

north-america,el-salvador,"The smallest country in Central America, El Salvador is big on natural wonders. The word is out among more intrepid travellers that this is the region’s up-and-coming destination. Newcomers are bowled over by the stunning landscape, with smoking volcanoes, surf-pounded beaches, pristine cloud forests and crystalline lagoons. And those in the know are drawn back time and again by its warm-hearted and dynamic people. This tiny tropical land, about the size of Wales or Massachusetts, is packed with highlights. Magnificent, crowd-free national parks include Cerro Verde, Montecristo and the irresistibly named El Imposible. You can shoot the rapids on whitewater rafts, or take a lazy boat ride across volcanic crater lakes Ilopango and Coatepeque. Surfers flock to the world-class Pacific breakers at Sonsonate, El Zonte and La Unión, only a short drive from the capital. The archaeological remains at Tazumal mark the furthest outpost of the Maya empire; the Ruta de Las Flores features colourful, flower-filled villages, with volcanic hot springs and indigenous craft markets; and Morazán province offers tours of civil war trenches led by former guerrillas turned guides. El Salvador still has a bad reputation for violent crime, but the truth is that the locals have always suffered much more than tourists at the hands of criminals, most of whom are more concerned with the feuding of rival drug gangs. The tourism industry is responding rapidly to the country’s rising popularity. Coffee plantations are inviting guests to visit, to eat and drink, to stay, to work. Beach resorts are becoming more boutique, spa hotels are multiplying and the eastern Gulf of Fonseca is being developed, with boat-and-bus routes connecting with neighbouring Nicaragua. El Salvador may not yet be the most comfortable place to visit in the region, but for the increasing number of people who are making the effort, the rewards are plentiful. 21,041 sq km (8,124 sq miles). 6,146,419 (UN estimate 2016). 291.9 per sq km.

Interim-President Claudia Juana Rodríguez de Guevara since 2023.","By the mid 1520s, a Spanish expedition to El Salvador had established a settlement named San Salvador, defeating the indigenous Pipil people who had previously occupied the region. The territory of El Salvador later became part of the Kingdom of Guatemala, but Salvadorans strongly objected to the Guatemalans' plan to incorporate the territory into the Mexican Empire. In 1824, after a brief war and having established its own constitution, El Salvador became one of the United Provinces of Central America (later the Federal Republic of Central America). Nonetheless, it was several decades before El Salvador was able to rid itself of the overwhelming influence of Guatemala. This came about largely through the influence of the coffee barons, who dominated El Salvador until the 1920s, and the military, which had by then entered the political arena. Economic problems blighted the country from the 1950s to the 1970s, with a brief diversion provided by the 1969 Soccer War with Honduras (essentially a border dispute). The 1980 assassination of Archbishop Oscar Romero – a leading critic of civil rights abuses – by right-wing elements, saw El Salvador plunge into civil war. As the war spread throughout the country in the 1980s, the government received huge amounts of US military and civil aid, with which it fought a brutal and fairly effective counter-insurgency campaign against leftist guerrillas of the Farabundo Marti Liberation Front (FMLN). Peace talks began in earnest in 1989, and a formal ceasefire, under UN auspices and supervised by a joint forum of the two sides, came into force at the beginning of 1992. It was not until the 2000 National Assembly election that the FLMN became the largest party. Political differences were temporarily set aside in January 2001, when the country was struck by a massive earthquake, which killed several thousand and left tens of thousands homeless. In 2009, Mauricio Funes, a former television journalist, became the first president from the FMLN party. He has presided over a number of key social reforms including the abolition of end-user fees for public health care, and the introduction of free shoes, clothes and meals for schoolchildren. Opponents point out that crime has not abated and the countrywide murder rate remains one of the highest in the world. Did you know? •	Archbishop Oscar Romero, who was assassinated in 1980, was declared a martyr by Pope Francis in 2015. •	The infamous Mara Salvatrucha (MS-13) street gang originated in Los Angeles, where many Salvadorans fled during the civil war. •	The nickname for Salvadorans is guanacos, a relative of the llama, though the name may also derive from the indigenous word for ‘brotherhood’. The majority (75%) of Salvadorans are Roman Catholic. A growing number (around 21%) are Protestant with Evangelical churches gaining influence. Visitors should not point their finger or their foot at anyone. First names should not be used to address someone unless invited to do so. Casual wear is acceptable. Men and women who already know each other greet with a kiss on the cheek, otherwise a handshake is always offered as a greeting. Siesta is still a tradition from around 1200-1400, although most shops and restaurants remain open.Photography: Sensitive (eg military) areas should not be photographed. The official language is Spanish. English is widely spoken but often not to a high standard. Do not expect to get by if you are unprepared to attempt at least a few words of Spanish. Most locals will welcome any attempt to speak their language.","El Salvador’s dry season (known locally as verano, or summer) runs between November and April, with a rainy season (invierno or winter) between May and October. In the rainy season, coastal and central regions typically suffer afternoon storms sandwiched between pleasant weather. In terms of temperature, the country’s subtropical climate can be divided into three separate zones, dependent on altitude. Coastal areas are uniformly hot throughout the year, the central plateau shows more extremes of hot and cold (though still rarely dropping below 10 °C) while upland areas have a cooler, more temperate climate. El Salvador is rarely affected by hurricanes, though tropical storm Agatha caused heavy rains and flooding in 2010. For most travellers, it is best to visit during the dry season and to avoid the hottest time of the year (March-April) when humidity levels are particularly high. Surfers, however, should aim for April to October, or March at a push. In August beach and lake resorts are busy with Salvadoran holidaymakers. Lightweight clothing and rainwear during the wet season in coastal areas. Waterproof clothing is advisable all year round. Warm clothing should be taken for higher altitudes. For camping and outdoor countryside activities, aim to cover up as much as possible to avoid potentially dangerous insect and animal bites. El Salvador is situated in Central America between 13° and 14°N. It is bordered north and west by Guatemala, north and east by Honduras, and south and west by the Pacific Ocean. The country is the smallest in Central America and uniquely within the region, it has no Caribbean coastline. North-easterly movement of the offshore Cocos tectonic plate and the westerly movement of El Salvador’s northern neighbours accounts for the frequency of earthquakes and volcanic activity in the country. Most of El Salvador is volcanic uplands, along which run two almost parallel volcanic ranges. The highest volcanoes are Santa Ana at 2,365m (7,759ft), San Vicente at 2,182m (7,159ft) and San Salvador at 1,943m (6,375ft). Volcanic activity has resulted in a thick layer of ash and lava on the highlands, creating a richly mineralised soil, ideal for coffee planting. Lowlands lie to the north and south of the high backbone. On the country’s longest river, the Rio Lempa, the 800m (2,624ft)-wide hydroelectric Cerrón Grande Dam provides power to much of the country and has created a reservoir with capacity of 2,180 million m³. Fed by rivers in Guatemala and Honduras, the Lempa flows in a broadly southern direction spreading into the Bajo Lempa flood plain before draining into the Pacific. Lago De Ilopango is the country’s largest ‘natural’ lake with surface area of 72 sq km (28 sq miles). A scenic crater lake with steeply scalloped banks, it lies just to the east of San Salvador. Of the country’s other lakes, Lago De Coatepeque is the most notable and perhaps most scenic with hot springs an added attraction for visitors. The lake covers 26 sq km (10 sq miles) in the province of Santa Ana, and like Ilopango it has steep high banks. Rising up from Coatepeque’s watery blue crater is Isla Teopán (‘sprouting island’) where important Mayan artefacts have been found."
north-america,united-states-of-america,"Sizzling beaches or a theme park bonanza might tempt you to Florida, but there’s more to the Sunshine State than golden sands and Disney shows. That said, Miami is a fabulous place to kick off your sojourn. The city’s sprawling South Beach delivers what the postcards promise: brightly coloured lifeguard huts, promenades of art deco architecture and a steady stream of tanned bods. It’s a place to pedal a powder-blue cruiser, sip refreshing mojitos or shimmy in sultry clubs. Miami’s not all about the beach, though. Head to a Cuban block party on Calle Ocho in Little Havana, take a dip in the Venetian pool at Coral Gables, or peruse the wares in the Design District. The Florida Keys archipelago, south of Miami, is a Caribbean-flavoured getaway with beautiful beaches and clear blue waters. For something wilder, head to the sprawling wetlands of the Everglades National Park, home to alligators, manatees and the endangered Florida panther. Orlando is theme park central. You can whizz through Disney’s Space Mountain or see a real rocket at the Kennedy Space Center located in Merritt Island, less than an hour from the city. Nearby Daytona Beach offers sandy resorts, seaside amusements and a packed calendar of motor racing events. Along the Gulf Coast in western Florida, the cities of Sarasota, Fort Myers and Naples serve up culture and tranquillity alongside stellar sunsets, while Tampa and St Petersburg boast sweeping beaches and picturesque historical sites.

Therefore, Florida was the first region in the continental US to be visited and settled by European explorers. Over the next two centuries, the Spanish and French settled the region, often through violence, until 1763 when the Spanish traded the colony to the British. However, in 1783, the Spanish retook the territory. Under control of the Spanish, Florida became a haven for Native Americans and runaway slaves. Howeer, as the years progressed, Americans also began to settle in the region as a result of land grants and ultimately attempted to occupy the region. In 1816, the First Seminole War broke out between the Seminoles, a Native American tribe indigenous to the region, and the US army, led by General Andrew Jackson. By the end of the war in 1819, the Spanish realized that they could no longer keep the Americans out of the territory. So, the Spanish agreed to cede the territory to the Americans that same year as part of the Adams-Onis Treaty. However, the treaty did not come into effect until 1821. In 1830, the Indian Removal Act was signed into law by president Andrew Jackson, which gave the federal government authority to remove Native Americans from the land. By 1858, most of the Native Americans in Florida had been forcibly removed. On 3 March 1845, Florida became the 27th state of the US. Plantation slavery, which was a major part of the state's economy, flourished and by 1860, 44% of the population was enslaved. By the start of the civil war in 1861, Florida seceded from the US along with six other states. By the end of the war in 1865, the South (Confederacy) surrendered and Florida was placed under military control by the North (Union) until 1868. Following the war, the Thirteenth Amendment was passed in 1865, which officially marked the end of slavery in the nation. With slavery abolished, agriculture (e.g. citrus, sugar, cotton and cattle) and tourism became mainstays of Florida's economy. And many of its emancipated African American population migrated to the North. In the 1920s, the Great Depression, along with a couple of hurricanes, devastated the state. However, by the end of the Second World War, the state finally began to recover as the low cost of living and the development of air conditioning attracted a steady migration of people. The opening of the Magic Kingdom in 1971 began Orlando's ascent to being a centre of family tourism. Following the Cuban Revolution in 1959, Florida became a haven for Latin American immigrants with Haitans, Jamaicans, Colombians and Venezuelans following in successive decades. The Mariel boatlife in 1980, in which Fidel Castro allowed scores of Cubans to immigrate to the US via the Florida Straits, permanently titled the demographics of the region. In 2017, Hurricane Irma hit Florida, which was the most expensive and catastrophic natural disaster to ever touch the state as well as various islands in the Caribbean. Meanwhile, the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in 2010 became the state's biggest man-made disaster.   Did you know? • Ernest Hemingway, Elmore Leonard and Tennesse Williams are famous authors who lived in Florida at one point in their lives • In 2014, the state’s felony disenfranchisement law was passed, which meant that more than one in ten Floridians – and one in four African-American Floridians were excluded from voting. However, in 2018, the state overturned its previous settlement and voted to restore the voting rights of those with past felony convictions. • Cannonball Adderley, Lynyrd Skynard, Jim Morrison, Slim Whitman, the Allman Brothers Band, KC & the Sunshine Band and, of course, Miami Sound Machine are all musicians and groups born in the state of Florida. Like most of the US, the predominant religion in Florida is Christianity. Protestants, particularly, make up the largest religious group in the state along with Baptists, Methodists, Pentecostal and other denominations. The remainder of the population is composed of other religious followers, such as Roman Catholics, Jews, and Muslims, as well as the non-religious. Floridians often exhibit a level of, what is referred to as, ‘Southern charm’. With that said, they tend to be quite warm and welcoming of visitors. However, this kind of attitude is more prominent in the northern areas of the state in comparison to the central and southern parts. English is the official language of the state of Florida. Spanish is also widely spoken, especially in Miami-Dade County.","On average, Florida tends to maintain warm temperatures throughout the entire year with slightly lower temperatures during the winter months. Summers are long, warm and particularly humid, lasting from May to October. And the winters throughout the state are quite short and dry, lasting from December to February. In January, the coldest month, the average temperature is 61°F (16°C). In July, the hottest month, the average temperature is 82°F (28°C). The climate in Florida is heavily influenced by the fact that the state is a peninsula, surrounded completely by the sea. Since the sea is able to store heat, the coastal areas tend to maintain s slightly warmer temperature in the winter than the central areas of the state. This also explains why the average temperature of the surrounding sea in Florida is the highest in the month of July (84°F or 29°C), making it one of the best times of the year for swimming. Florida, in particular, also tends to experience a wet and a dry season throughout the year. During the wet season, lasting from May to October, the state tends to experience high levels of humidity followed by heavy, yet brief, thunderstorms on almost a daily basis. In fact, Florida reports more thunderstorms on average than any other US state. The north-western coastal areas are especially prone to instances of heavy rainfall, more than any other area in the state. Thus, those interested in staying in the drier areas should keep to the interior or try the southwestern coastal areas. The wet season also increases the chance of tropical storms and hurricanes, particularly from August to October. During the dry season, in contrast, the state tends to experience low levels of humidity and clear skies, lasting from November to April. However, since the chances of rainfall are significantly less during this period, displays of wildfire do occur, but not on a frequent basis. During the summer months, sunglasses, hats, lightweight cottons and linens are recommended, though air conditioning in many public places can push indoor temperatures down. It does tend to get a bit cooler during the evenings and nights, so light jackets are also recommended. During the winter months, heavier coats may occasionally come in handy in the northern areas, whereas, light coats may be useful in the central and southern parts of the state.  The state of Florida occupies, for the most part, a relatively flat peninsula between the Atlantic Ocean, the Gulf of Mexico and the Florida Straits. At its most distant points, it extends approximately 805 km (500 miles). The states of Alabama and Georgia border Florida to the north, with a portion of Alabama bordering the state at the western tip of the Panhandle. Bimini, one of the islands of the Bahamas, lies a mere 92 km (57 miles) from the city of Miami and Havana, the capital of Cuba, is around 171 km (106 miles) south of Key West. With a total area of 170,304 sq km (65,755 sq miles), Florida ranks 22nd among the 50 states in size. The state boasts 13,576 km (8,436 miles) of coastline, 1,067 km (663 miles) of which are beaches. The St. Johns River is the longest river in the state, running northward for 499 km (310 miles) from the St. Johns Marsh in Indian River County to its outlet with the Atlantic Ocean at Jacksonville. Lake Okeechobee is Florida’s largest freshwater lake measured at 1,891 sq km (730 sq miles), making it the second largest freshwater lake within the contiguous United States. Florida’s highest point, Britton Hill, is situated at 105 m (345 ft) above sea level in the Panhandle, making it the lowest highpoint of any US state. Florida, like most other states, is divided into smaller administrative units called counties. In total, there are 67 counties in the state. Miami-Dade County is the most populated county, according to 2018 census figures, with 2,761,581 residents. Liberty County, in contrast, is the least populated county in the entire state with only 8,457 residents. The largest county, in terms of area, is Palm Beach County (5,268 sq km or 2,034 sq miles) while the smallest is Union County (622 sq km or 240 sq miles). The largest cities in Florida, in terms of population, are Jacksonville, Miami and Tampa, according to 2018 census figures. The largest metropolitan areas by population include Miami-Fort Lauderdale-West Palm Beach, Tampa-St. Petersburg-Clearwater and Orlando-Kissimmee-Sanford."
north-america,united-states-of-america,"Georgia is delightfully diverse, mixing shiny skyscrapers and antebellum architecture, forested mountains and low-lying swamps, with no end of irresistible Southern charm.  In the booming city of Atlanta (known as “The City in a Forest”), magnolia and dogwood trees surround handsome Georgian-style homes, yet only blocks away, dazzling contemporary buildings add to the city’s ever-growing skyline. The glitzy Georgia Aquarium and the World of Coca-Cola (sugar overload alert) are visitor magnets, while locals bike the Eastside Trail and refuel at Ponce City Market’s cosmopolitan eateries. Small-town Georgia shows its stuff on the Antebellum Trail, winding through over 160km (100 miles) of sprawling plantation estates, colonnaded antebellum homes and beautifully preserved inns dishing up Southern soul food of grits and fried chicken. Hundreds of hardcore thru-hikers start the Appalachian Trail at Springer Mountain every spring, but if you don’t have a spare six months to trek all 3,510km (2,181 miles) to Maine, fear not. Hikes to Blood Mountain, the trail’s highest point in Georgia, or Long Creek Falls, are both doable in a day. Canoeists gently tease their paddles through the Okefenokee Swamp’s black water to avoid too-close-for-comfort encounters with the 20,000 alligators living in this peaty bog. Black bears, blue herons and white-tailed deer are all keeping an eye on you too. To the east, wild horses roam on Cumberland Island, a plantation turned Carnegie family retreat, and now a place to camp, flop on undeveloped beaches and hike through untouched coastal forest. History buffs can visit Civil War battlefields and sites across the state, including Old Fort Jackson on the Savannah River, Georgia’s oldest intact brick fortification, with ear-splitting daily cannon firings. And movie aficionados may recognise a few spots from The Hunger Games or The Walking Dead. Fortunately, you’re unlikely to meet any zombies. 152,732 sq km (58,970 sq miles). 10.2 million (2015). 66.9 per sq km. Atlanta.","Control over Georgia was a long fought battle. The Yamasee Indians lived in Georgia, along with the Cherokee and Creek Indians long before European exploration. As the English and Spanish traders ventured into nearby regions and established colonies and settlements, control became a point of tension between the two groups. Eventually, the Spanish and Yamasee Indians left the area and the British moved in; MP James Oglethorpe petitioned to make Georgia a colony for England’s poor, and secured a royal charter for the colony in 1732. Initially, the trustees of the colony forbade slavery in Georgia; this had not been done in any of the other colonies. However, in 1749 the ban was repealed as it became clear that a plantation economy was the most profitable for Georgia’s agricultural conditions. Profits from rice, indigo, and sugar cane plantations came to dominate Georgia’s economy. Although Georgia supported the other 12 colonies in the American Revolution, their only demand was “No taxation without representation.” On the whole, the colony remained fairly uninvolved in the conflict and signed the US Constitution in 1788. After the revolution, Georgia’s agriculture boomed, thanks to Eli Whitney, the creator of cotton gin (a machine which capable of separating cotton fibres from the seed on an industrial scale). This sudden growth of the cotton industry caused a huge influx in the Georgia population and continued importation of slaves from neighbouring states like South Carolina. During the Civil War, Georgia seceded from the Union to join the Confederacy, defending slavery in an attempt to preserve their economic prosperity. Georgia, however, was devastated during the war and especially during General Sherman’s infamous March to the Sea, where he burned Atlanta to the ground and left a trail of destruction across the state. Although slavery ended with the Civil War, equal rights were far off in Georgia. The Jim Crow laws enacted in the late 19th century, which mandated racial segregation in all public buildings and facilities, contributed to the disfranchisement of former slaves. It wasn’t until the Civil Rights Movement began in the 1940s that African Americans began to see equality. Georgia is also home to famed Civil Rights leader Martin Luther King Jr., who was born in Atlanta in 1929. Today, Atlanta is a hub of the south and a leader in industry, manufacturing, and retail and notably, is the home of Coca-Cola. A hub for shopping and tourism, Georgia is a popular destination for holidays and visitors. Christianity is the most prevalent religion in Georgia, with Baptist and Methodist being the largest groups, followed by Catholic and other Christian faiths. There is a small population of Jewish and Muslim residents as well. Like much of the south, Georgians are known for their laid back, slow-moving lifestyle and impeccable manners. ‘Ma’am’ or ‘Miss’ is usually used to address women and ‘Sir’ is used for men. The pronoun “y’all” is commonly used to as a plural form of “you.” English is the official language of Georgia and is by far the most widely-spoken language in the state. A distinct dialect called Gullah, English influenced by West and Central African languages, is spoken on the islands off of Georgia’s southern coast and is characterised by the lack of personal pronouns and invariable form of “be.”","Hot/humid in summer; mild in winter. Cooler in the northern mountains. Temperatures range from a January high of 10°C (50°F) and a low of 0°C (32°F) to a July high of 33°C (90°F) and a low of 21°C (70°F).

north-america,greenland,"Remote Greenland is the world's biggest island, while the sea that surrounds it is either permanently frozen or chilled by the mainly cold currents. In the centre of the country, ice can be up to 3km (2 miles) thick. No wonder that most of the population huddles around the ice-free coastal region. Indeed, the name 'Greenland' is a bit of a misnomer, although there are sheep-laden green fields in the south. Those wondering why anyone would want to inhabit such unforgiving terrain are ignoring the beautiful sights that Greenland grants. The arctic nights in the winter concoct a wondrous continuous twilight. In the far north of the country, complete darkness is coupled with the spectacular Northern Lights during the coldest months. While Greenland may not be top of many travellers' bucket lists, where else can you visit such raw and unspoilt landscapes? The profusion of snow creates the perfect conditions for activities such as dog sledging and tour cruises, which interweave in and out of Greenland's dazzling array of fjords, mountains, islands and icebergs. You can even go kayaking in the waters, though best to play it safe. The wildlife does not disappoint, either: there is an abundance of whales, seals and birds in the area. There are hardly any roads on the island, so expect to fork out for boat travel, or even helicopter journeys. The upshot is that glacial vistas, yawning fjords and soaring mountains are all there for the taking. Definitely bring a camera. Although Greenland's appeal rests with its wondrous nature, there are a few thousand Greenlanders living on the sparsely populated island, and on the western coast they offer up a handful of picturesque villages. Mostly living in brightly painted wooden cottages, Greenlanders may have a reputation for being rather closed, but give them time and space, and you will discover a truly compelling culture, one that fuses both Inuit and Danish heritage. With transport options and tourism agencies having improved travelling conditions of late, there's never been a better time to visit Greenland. 2,166,086 sq km (836,330 sq miles). 56,196 (UN estimate 2016). 0.03 per sq km.

Egede since 2021.","The first European settlements of Greenland were established on the west coast in the 10th-century. Responsibility is usually credited to Eric the Red, reputedly the son of a Norwegian chieftain banished from his home in Iceland for murder. The colonists accepted Norwegian sovereignty around 1260, which lasted until the marginal lifestyle of the settlements finally led to their collapse in the 16th-century. The territory was then unoccupied by Europeans until Denmark took possession of it during its own phase of colonial expansion in the early 18th century. It became an integral part of the Danish realm in 1953. A referendum in 1979 approved internal autonomy within the Kingdom of Denmark: Copenhagen retains control of defence, foreign policy and constitutional matters. Subsequently, a new 21-member parliament was set up, since expanded to 31 seats. In 1982, in another referendum, the population voted by a narrow majority to leave the EC (as it then was) which they had joined as part of Denmark in 1972. Greenland is now an overseas territory in association with the EU, which provides certain trade privileges and access to EU aid. Another source of conflict between Greenland and Denmark has been the presence of a major American military radar installation at Thule in the north, which may be involved in a future US missile defence system. While most of the population would prefer it removed, the Danish Government says that it is bound by treaty obligations. The issue led to the collapse of Greenland's coalition Government in March 1987. This was an alliance of the social-democratic Siumit (Forward) the political party which grew from the nationalist opposition movement to European membership back in the 1970s and the leftist Inuit Ataqatigiit (IA, Inuit Brotherhood), which seeks full independence. These two, plus the conservative Atassut (Solidarity) party, are the main political parties. Coalition governments have controlled the Government for the last 20-odd years. These have been generally stable, but 2003 has proved to be an exception. The December 2002 election had returned Siumut as the largest party, forming a coalition Government with IA under the premiership of Siumut leader Hans Enoksen. However, the Government fell after a month under farcical circumstances, relating to the activities of a faith-healer apparently hired to purge Government offices of evil spirits. Siumut and Enoksen remained in power, with Attasut as its coalition partner, but this Government was also short-lived. It collapsed after eight months following a dispute over miscalculation of the territory's budget. The Inuit Brotherhood later rejoined Siumut in Government. With Siumut winning 10 of the 31 available seats in the November 2005 election, they will again need to form a coalition to remain in government. Evangelical Lutheran Church of Denmark majority, with small groups of Roman Catholics and other Protestant denominations. Life is generally conducted at a more relaxed pace than is usual in northern Europe, as exemplified by the frequent use of the word immaqa - 'maybe'. Until recently, foreign visitors were very rare. The name of the country in Greenlandic is Kalaallit Nunaat, meaning 'Land of the People'. Photography: Throughout the country there is a ban on taking photographs inside churches or church halls during services. A UV or skylight filter and a lens shade should always be used. In winter, the camera must be polar-oiled. It is advisable to bring your own film. Film cannot always be developed in Greenland. The official languages are Greenlandic, an Inuit (Eskimo) language and Danish. Greenlanders connected with tourism will normally speak English.","Greenland has an Arctic climate, but owing to the size of the country there are great variations in the weather. As the climate graph shows, winters can be severe and the summers comparatively mild, particularly in areas which are sheltered from the prevailing winds. Precipitation, mostly snow, is moderately heavy around the coast. The north of the country, and much of the interior, enjoys true Arctic weather, with the temperature only rising above freezing for brief periods in the summer.Conditions in all parts of the country can become hazardous when there is a combination of a low temperature and a strong wind. Local advice concerning weather conditions should be followed very carefully. Nevertheless, the summer months are suitable for a wide range of outdoor activities. Good-quality windproof and waterproof clothes, warm layers and moulded sole shoes at all times of the year; also some slightly thinner clothes - it is important to be able to change clothing during a day's climbing as temperatures can vary greatly during one day. Sunglasses and protective sun lotion are strongly advised. In July and August, mosquitoes can be a problem, especially inside the fjords and so a mosquito net can prove indispensable. Extra warm clothes are necessary for those contemplating dog-sledge expeditions. Extra clothes are not always available for hire in Greenland. Greenland is the world's biggest island. The surrounding seas are either permanently frozen or chilled by cold currents. The inland area is covered with ice, stretching 2,500km (1,500 miles) north-south and 1,000km (600 miles) east-west. In the centre, the ice can be up to 3km (2 miles) thick. The ice-free coastal region, which is sometimes as wide as 200km (120 miles), covers a total of 410,449 sq km (158,475 sq miles), and is where all of the population is to be found. This region is intersected by deep fjords which connect the inland ice area with the sea."
north-america,guatemala,"Guatemala humbly has it all: from colonial towns to Mayan ruins, great mountain lakes to vibrant religious festivals, sandy beaches to exotic jungles. Often visitors to the country find they leave enlightened; civilisations they believed long gone are found thriving, Tomb Raider landscapes they thought fantasy are shown to be real. Antiquity is at the heart of Guatemala, and the country is home to many spectacular Mayan archaeological sites, most significantly the vast UNESCO World Heritage Site of Tikal, where great towers peep through the rainforest canopy and monkeys swing past the sprawling ancient plazas. The pine-forested hills of the highlands are home to many Mayan communities, whose indigenous beliefs, traditional dress, religious practices and craftsmanship, flourish. Indeed, Guatemala has around 21 different ethnic groups, speaking some 23 languages giving it a distinctive culture like nowhere else in the region. Although Guatemala boasts some truly stunning cities – most notably Antigua, an upmarket colonial town surrounded by smouldering volcanoes – Guatemala’s real joy is its nature. The great Lake Atitlan in the highlands is a place of rare beauty and offers various adventure activities ranging from scuba diving to fishing. On the other side of the country, the vast and remote region of Peten houses the country’s thickest jungle, home to long-abandoned Mayan ruins that few get to see. Elsewhere, gargantuan lakes, lava-oozing volcanoes, black sandy beaches, natural hot springs and roaring rivers combine to form the most geographically diverse destination in Central America. Though consistently beautiful, Guatemala is a nation of contrasts; a place where Catholic churches exist alongside Mayan temples, where rugged highlands give way to tropical jungles, and where the legacy of its ancient civilisations is as evident as its modern, Latin American culture. Despite stories of high crime rates and volatile politics, most visitors encounter nothing but warmth and hospitality from its people, as well as epic landscapes that make them wonder why they didn’t visit sooner. 108,889 sq km (42,042 sq miles). 16,672,956 (UN estimate 2016). 137 per sq km. Guatemala City. Constitutional Democratic Republic. President Bernardo Arévalo since 2024. President Alejandro Giammattei since 2020.","Guatemala is steeped in Mayan history and many aspects of the ancient civilization have endured to this day. The Mayans were dominant through much of Central America from 2000 BC until the 15th century AD when the Europeans arrived. The region was soon conquered by Spanish conquistador, Pedro de Alvarado, in 1524. It wasn’t until the early 19th century however, that the Spanish conceded independence to their American colonies, principally Mexico, into which Guatemala was briefly incorporated in 1822. Guatemala enjoyed comparative stability, punctuated by brief periods of upheaval, under a series of dictators who were content to keep the country under a quasi-feudal regime underpinned by a small clique of land-owning families. The government of Colonel Arbenz Guzman attempted various land reforms in the early 1950s, but was overthrown by a US-backed invasion led by military opponents. The country then slid into a state of almost perpetual civil war between a series of right-wing military governments and various leftist guerrilla movements. Guatemala’s successful transition from military to civilian government began in 1985, when the new constitution was put into effect. The centre-right Partido Democracia Cristiana Guatemalteca (PDCG) formed the majority party in the new National Congress, staying in control until 1995 when they came up against serious challenges from the Plan por el Adelantamiento Nacional (National Advance Party, PAN), and the Frente Republicano – Guatemalteco (FRG). A period of political musical chairs ended in 1995 with a FRG/PDCG coalition in control. Only then did the government admit that its predecessors, especially the Rios Montt regime, were responsible for massive human rights abuses. A UN-sponsored investigation concluded in 1999 that the army was responsible for 90% of the estimated 200,000 killings thaty occurred during the conflict. Efrain Rios Montt is currently standing trial for genocide. The complicity of American governments in the counter-insurgency campaign was also highlighted, and drew an apology from US president Bill Clinton. In recent years, Guatemalan politics has continued to be plagued by scandal, and in 2015, former President Otto Pérez Molina was forced to resign after evidence surfaced of his involvement in a customs corruption ring. Widespread distrust of the political establishment led to the election of former TV comedian and first-time politician Jimmy Morale, who has promised to stamp out corruption. Just how he will go about that remains unclear. Did you know? • The name Guatemala is derived from an Indian phrase meaning ‘land of trees’. • Though Spanish is the official language, it isn’t the only one: there are at least 21 Mayan languages, a couple of non-Mayan indigenous languages and Garifuna, which is spoken by communities on the Caribbean coast. • Despite its relatively small size, Guatemala is home to 33 volcanoes. About 60% of the population are Catholic. Most of the remaining population are Protestant with a smaller percentage of the population having indigenous Mayan beliefs. Some indigenous communities hold services combining Catholicism with pre-Columbian rites. Guatemala is the most populated of the Central American republics and is the only one which is predominantly Indian, although the Spanish have had a strong influence on the way of life. Full names should be used when addressing acquaintances, particularly in business. Dress is conservative and casual wear is suitable except in the smartest dining rooms and clubs.Photography: Locals are often suspicious of foreigners taking photographs, particularly of young children. Before approaching children for photos, or even just to talk to them, you should check with an an adult that this is acceptable. However, if you are in any doubt, refrain from doing so. You may be asked to pay a small amount of money to take photographs of both children and adults. The official language is Spanish which is spoken by 60% of the population. There are also 23 officially recognised indigenous languages.","Guatemala’s weather is eternally comfortable: neither too hot nor too cold. Its seasons tend to be divided into the dry season and the wet season, although the temperature,which averages 22°C (72°F) across the country, varies more according to altitude than by season. November through to April is the dry season and in the mountainous central region (Guatemala City, Antigua, Lake Atitlan, Chichicastenango, Cobán and the highlands) it is an ideal climate for outdoor pursuits with average temperatures of 18°C (64°F). It also coincides with the festivals of Semana Santa, Day of the Dead, the Burning of the Devil and the Saint Thomas festival in Chichicastenango. The rainy season runs from May to October which can hinder travel in more remote areas where roads are not well maintained, with Petén receiving the most amount of rainfall. In higher climes, near the centre of the country, the rainy season, running from May to September, is characterised by clear skies after abundant rainfall in the afternoons and evenings. This means that travel during this time can be extremely pleasant, with less crowds and cooler temperatures. Temperatures can fall sharply at night. The coastal regions and the northeast are hot throughout the year with an average temperature of 20°C (68°F) sometimes rising to as much as 37°C (99°F), although the Pacific coast has more unpredictable weather and rain is possible year round. The busiest time of the year for tourism is between December and May when the dry season and festivals mean that much of the accommodation can be booked long in advance (especially in Antigua during Semana Santa). This is also a popular time for language learning and many North Americans come to study in the schools in towns such as Antigua and Xela. Lightweight clothing. Jacket or light woollens for the evening. Waterproof jacket during rainy season. Hiking boots for outdoor activities. Guatemala is the third largest country in Central America and shares borders to the north and west with Mexico, to the southeast with El Salvador and Honduras, to the northeast with Belize and the Caribbean Sea, and to the south with the Pacific Ocean. The landscape is predominantly mountainous and heavily forested, with narrow coastal plains and tropical, humid lowlands blanketed in rainforests, coffee and banana plantations. A string of volcanoes rises above the southern highlands along the Pacific, four of which are still active. Within this volcanic area are basins of varying sizes which hold the majority of the country's population. The region is drained by rivers flowing into both the Pacific and the Caribbean; however one basin west of the capital has no river outlet and thus has formed Lake Atitlán, which is ringed by volcanoes. To the northwest, bordering on Belize and Mexico, lies the low undulating tableland of El Petén, 36,300 sq km (14,000 sq miles) of almost inaccessible wilderness covered with dense hardwood forest. This area covers approximately one-third of the national territory, yet contains only 40,000 people."
north-america,united-states-of-america,"Smouldering volcanoes, tropical rainforests, idyllic beaches, legendary surf and blistering sunshine: you need a good excuse not to visit Hawaii. Oahu, home to the state capital Honolulu, is the most popular island. Big-wave surfing took off here in the 1950s and the pros still pilgrimage to Waimea Bay for its epic swells. You don't have to be a veteran boarder to take advantage of the conditions, though: Waikiki Beach offers an easier ride for those still finding their feet. The second largest of Hawaii’s islands, Maui seems to win every best beach award going. But those looking to sizzle on the sand will struggle to beat Makena Beach, which is a regular Instagram star. If you’re not content lounging by the shore, ascend nearby Haleakalā, the island’s highest peak, to marvel at some exquisite panoramas. Just across the water, tiny Lanai’s luxury resorts and golf courses may bleed your wallet dry, but go for the day and you can rumble across lunar like landscapes in a 4-wheel drive, gaze at ghostly shipwrecks, and hike through virgin rainforests. Unspoiled Molokai is also a short ferry hop from Maui and lays claim to the world’s highest sea cliffs. Visitors can get as close as they dare to an active volcano on Hawaii Island, where hyperactive Kilauea of Hawaii Volcanoes National Park has been spewing copious amounts of lava every day since 1983. And then there’s Kauai, Hawaii’s northernmost island. Offering jagged cliffs, primal rainforests, and barrelling waterfalls, it’s paradise for adventure travellers, who can spot green sea turtles off Poipu Beach, hike through Waimea Canyon, and kayak down the raging Waimea River. The only disappointment is leaving. 16,635 sq km (6,423 sq miles). 1.4 million (2016). 82.6 per sq km. Honolulu.","Polynesians were the first to travel to and inhabit Hawaii, though there are several opposing theories about their initial migration. The European discovery of the islands was made by James Cook on his voyage to discover the Northwest Passage, and he dubbed them the Sandwich Islands (after the Earl of Sandwich). Hawaii was united in 1810 under Kamehameha the Great, and became known as the Kingdom of Hawaii. Many outside powers influenced the islands during these years, including Russia, France, and Great Britain. In 1875, the Kingdom of Hawaii and the United States signed the Reciprocity Treaty, which allowed duty free importation of Hawaiian sugar and rice to the US. In exchange the US gained Pearl Harbour and the surrounding 6 km (4 miles), free of cost. American and Hawaiian plantation workers revolted against the increasingly unpopular Hawaiian monarchy in 1887 with the assistance of US troops. The revolt resulted in a new constitution, limiting the monarchy’s power and lessening its sphere of influence. In 1893, the unpopular Queen drafted a new constitution in an attempt to increase her power; meanwhile, a group of residents were plotting to overthrow her reign. The US government sent sailors to impose the Provisional Government of Hawaii to maintain order over the islands once the queen had been dethroned by revolutionaries. President William McKinley signed the Newlands Resolution in 1898 which annexed Hawaii, despite opposition from the Japanese and some Amerocans. At the start of WWII, the US identified itself as a neutral nation. However, on December 7, 1941, Pearl Harbour was attacked by the Japanese to prevent future US involvement in the Pacific. This surprise assault prompted the US to enter the war on the side of the Allies, the eventual victors. Backed by popular support, President Dwight Eisenhower signed Hawaii into statehood in 1959, making it the 50th and final state admitted to the US. Since gaining statehood, Hawaii has become a popular tourist destination known for its good climate, pristine beaches, and phenomenal surfing. In Hawaii, the majority of residents are Christian; Roman Catholicism and Pentecostalism are the two largest denominations. There are also a fairly large number of Mormon residents and those who affiliate with Eastern religions, such as Buddhism or Hinduism. Only a small number of residents practice the traditional Hawaiian religion originated by the ancient Hawaiians. Leis are often handed outout, and available on arriving at the airport, as a gesture of “aloha,” or hello, in Hawaii. They can also be used as congratulations. The gifting of a lei is usually accompanied by a kiss on the cheek. It is customary when entering someone’s home to remove your shoes and leave them outdoors. Not doing so is considered rude and disrespectful. Similarly, referring to the continental US as “The States,” is also found highly insulting because it implies that Hawaii is not considered a state.","Hawaii is warm throughout the year, with an average temperature of 25.5 to 29°C (78 to 85°F), and no appreciable difference between 'summer' and 'winter.' Heavy rainfall can occur in the mountainous areas from December to February, but most regions only receive short showers, while others remain totally arid. Lightweights are advised throughout the year, with slightly warmer clothes for winter. Beachwear is popular, and protection from the midday sun, such as sunglasses and sun hats, is advisable."
north-america,honduras,"The second-largest country in Central America – and also one of the poorest – Honduras is once ugly and beautiful. Behind the reefs and rainforests, it has the unfortunate claim to being the murder capital of the world and the high crime risk means visitors should be cautious at all times. Some may advise against visiting altogether, but to do so would be to miss out – for Honduras has much to offer those adventurous enough to visit. The Bay Islands are perhaps the country’s biggest drawing card. The archipelago offers some of the best diving in Central America, not to mention the chance to swim with dolphins and come face to face with whale sharks. The less adventurous can lounge in hammocks and soak up the party vibe, if that sounds too wild. Back on the mainland, sweeping Caribbean beaches are scattered with charming towns such as Trujillo, with its pirate history, and traditional Garifuna villages, whose Afro-Caribbean culture is an integral part of the national identity. The great Pico Bonito National Park boasts jaguars, monkeys and countless bird species, while the Rio Plátano Biosphere Reserve, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, teems with exotic wildlife and indigenous communities. In the midst of all this nature, Honduras’ cities are easily forgotten and although soaring crime rates in the likes of San Pedro Sula keep visitors away, it would be a shame to miss out on the colonial architecture of the capital city Tegucigalpa, the Semana Santa celebrations in Comayagua or the lively carnival in La Ceiba. It may be troubled, but Honduras is a passionate nation, where religion, tradition and family values are the backbone of society and where a love for the national football team can unite even ardent enemies. It is a country where tortillas and beans are served with every meal, where hips swing to Latino beats and the national beer is called Salva Vida, meaning “lifesaver.” It is a country of untamed beauty and wild tropical adventure.

President Xiomara Castro since 2022.","The Maya civilisation reached modern-day Honduras around AD 500, and dominated the region for the next 300 years, after which several different local ethnic groups took their place. Contact with Europeans began soon after Christopher Columbus landed in 1502 and during the early 1520s the region was subjugated by a variety of conquistador expeditions, each of which laid claim to a part of it. Only after the discovery of gold and silver deposits in the 1540s was some order imposed on the region. Once the deposits were exhausted at the end of the 16th century, Honduras became a colonial backwater and remained so until the collapse of the Spanish Empire in the Americas in the early-19th century. During the early 20th century, Honduras was governed by a series of caudillos, notably President Tiburcio Carias Andino who dominated the country during the 1930s and 1940s. While the peaceful environment that Carias Andino created allowed for social and economic progress, this was at the price of serious internal repression and kowtowing to powerful foreign interests. From the late 1950s onwards, weak civilian governments prompted the army to assume a greater role, launching several coups. During the 1980s, Honduras was the main base for the US-backed 'Contra' rebels fighting the Sandinista government in Nicaragua. Soon after the end of that war in 1989, national elections were held. The two parties, the Partido Nacional (PN) and the Partido Liberal (PL), fought for the presidency, which was won by the PN candidate Rafael Leonardo Callejas. The 1990s, however, were dominated by the PL, which gained control of the presidency and legislature in 1994 and in 1997. In 1998, Hurricane Mitch swept violently across Honduras causing devastating damage. Almost 15,000 people died, 80% of the transportation infrastructure was destroyed and the resulting damage cost some US$3.8 billion. PL leader Manuel Zelaya Rosales emerged the victor in the 2005 elections, defeating Porfirio Lobo of the PN. However, in 2009, following Zelaya’s call for a change to the constitution, the army ousted him and Roberto Micheletti took over. In 2009 , following sustained pressure from international bodies including the Organization of American States and the United Nations, democratic general elections were held, resulting in victory for Lobo. Did you know? •	The term ‘Banana Republic’ was coined by US writer O. Henry, inspired by the United Fruit Company’s powerful control of Honduran exports in the early 20th century. •	Mosquitia, in eastern Honduras, is known as the ‘Little Amazon’, because of its having the largest tract of prime rainforest north of the actual Amazon Basin. •	Following a World-Cup preliminary football match Honduras and El Salvador declared what was subsequently known as the ‘Football War’, which lasted 100 hours and resulting in the expulsion of some 130,000 illegal Salvadoran immigrants from Honduras.

Hotels, restaurants and shops include a 12% sales tax on all purchases. There is a strong sense of community, and religious and local festivities hold great importance in Honduran life with traditional music, costume and customs. The official language is Spanish. English is widely spoken by the West Indian settlers in the north and on the Bay Islands off the Caribbean coast. Amerindian dialects are also spoken.","The climate is tropical with cooler, more temperate weather in the mountains with temperatures ranging from 16°C (61°F) to 20°C (68°F). The north coast is very hot with rain throughout the year, and though the offshore breezes temper the climate, the sun is very strong. The dry season is from November to April and the wet season runs from May to October. Despite their proximity to the mainland the Bay Islands have a slightly different, subtropical climate. The temperatures along the Caribbean coast and island range from 24°C (75°F) to 34°C (93°F) and, in contrast to the mainland, the rainy season in the Bay Islands is from July to January, with the rainiest months being October through early January. The remainder of the year is usually very dry. The southern Pacific Coast tends to be hot and dry with temperatures between 28° (82°F) to 32°C (90°F). The Caribbean hurricane season is between June and November and although the Bay Islands and Caribbean coast of Honduras are outside the typical hurricane path, they do often receive the tail end of tropical storms or hurricanes during this time. The main high season in Honduras is between January and June, although this extends to September for the Bay Islands. The intense rainy season can hinder much travel, and roads are often blocked due to rock slides and flooding. Activities such as kayaking and white water rafting are best done after the height of the rainy season, and while scuba diving centres in the Bay Islands are open year-round, the high season is in the dry season. Whale shark sightings off the islands can be done year-round but chances are higher in March and April. Semana Santa is the busiest time of the year for the islands and accommodation should be booked long in advance. In La Moskitia region, the drier seasons of February to May and August to November are the best for travel. Lightweight cottons and linens; warmer clothes are recommended between November and February and in the mountains. Waterproofs are needed for the wet season. Honduras shares borders in the southeast with Nicaragua, in the west with Guatemala, and in the southwest with El Salvador. To the north lies the Caribbean, with which it has 669 km (416 miles) of coastline and to the south, the Pacific Ocean. The interior of the country comprises a central mountain system running from east to west, cut by rivers flowing into both the Caribbean and Pacific. The lowlands in the south form a plain along the Pacific coast, while the highest point in the country is Cerro Las Minas at 2,870m (9,416 ft) above sea level. The Gulf of Fonseca in the southwest contains many islands which have volcanic peaks. The large fertile valleys of the northern Caribbean lowlands are cultivated with banana plantations. However, large areas of land in Honduras are unsuitable for cultivation. The majority of the population lives in the western half of the country, while the second-largest concentration of people is in the Cortés area which extends northwards from Lake Yojoa towards the Caribbean. Along the Caribbean shore is the virtually uninhabited La Moskitia Coast. The Bay Islands, which consist of Roatan, Utila and Guanaja (along with Cayos Cochinos) are located to the north of the country, a few miles off the coast of La Ceiba. They are low-lying islands, surrounded by many cays, and are part of the Mesoamerican Barrier Reef."

Spuds are definitely are on the menu however; Idaho is the number one potato producer in the USA and the humble root vegetable is synonymous with the state. So are jewels. Nearly every known gemstone has been found in Idaho, which is affectionately dubbed the Gem State. Of course, there’s much more to Idaho than spuds and stones. Nestling on the western side of the Rocky Mountains, the state dishes up a hefty dollop of stellar scenery: evergreen forests, raging rivers, gnarly lava fields, dazzling mountains and shimmering lakes abound. Unspoilt, with huge sweeps of wilderness, this sparsely populated state may lack the fame of neighbouring Washington and Montana, but it also lacks the crowds. Nature shows off its finest and weirdest sides here. Boats barrel along the Snake River through Hells Canyon, North America’s deepest river gorge. Sand dunes higher than the London Eye roll across the high desert of Bruneau Dunes State Park. Mountains and alpine lakes festoon the Sawtooth Wilderness area. And so lunar-like are the lava fields at Craters of the Moon National Monument, NASA astronauts used it for moonwalk training in 1969. It’s no wonder adventurers are cottoning on to the lure of this little-known state. Rafters and kayakers hurtle through white-water rapids on the Middle Fork of the Salmon River. Anglers hook more cutthroat trout than they can handle in the Selway River. Horseback riders saddle up and corral cattle on dude ranches.

Boise.","Prior to European or American settlement, Native Americans lived in Idaho for thousands of years, hunting and gathering across the Snake River Plain. The three most populous groups at the time were the Shoshone, Nez Perez, and Northern Paiute. The mountainous region of Idaho was first added to the US territory in 1803 with the Louisiana Purchase and soon afterwards the first European explorers, Lewis and Clark, entered the area on their cross-country trek to the Pacific. Both Fort Boise and Fort Hall, trading posts for the British and Americans respectively, were established in the 1830s, but the population didn’t take off until gold was discovered in the region in 1852. Shortly afterwards, Idaho’s first town, Franklin, was founded near the Utah border. In 1863, President Abraham Lincoln created the Idaho Territory by combining parts of both the Washington and Dakota Territories. A few years later, President Benjamin Harrison signed Idaho into statehood in 1890. Idaho was a vital addition to the country, with major gold stores being found throughout the state. In addition to gold, metals and minerals were mined in the region, generating a large portion of the state’s profit. Mineworkers, however, felt mistreated and underpaid, and in 1892, workers at Coeur d’Alene mine (the largest producer) went on strike. The mine owners brought in non-union workers, and the strikers rioted and company guards reacted violently. The strikes and violence continued in Coeur d’Alene and other mines across the state, escalating again in 1899 when Governor Frank Steunenberg was forced to send in federal troops to end the fighting. The battle ended in the eventual assassination of former governor Steunenberg by a WFM (Western Federation of Miners) member in 1905. Though today mining is still a major part of the state’s economy, Idaho has diversified to include agriculture and timber production. The state is also known for its focus on outdoor activities, with a wide range of downhill and cross-country ski opportunities in winter, along with fishing, hiking, and mountain biking. Unlike the majority of US states, the largest religious group in Idaho is Mormon; they comprise over one quarter of the state’s religious population. The second largest group is Christian, with Catholicism being the largest denomination. Smaller groups of Jewish, Islamic, and Eastern religion denominations exist as well. Outside of neighbouring Utah, Idaho has the largest Mormon population in the United States. According to church teachings, Mormons often avoid alcohol, gambling, caffeine, and other drugs. Despite a slightly different lifestyle, Mormons are otherwise no different than other religious groups and appreciate their lifestyle choice being respected by others. Residents of Idaho, like many others in the Midwest, are traditionally considered polite, friendly, and adverse to confrontation. English is the official and most widely spoken language in Idaho.","The Idaho climate is quite diverse. The north has cold winters with heavy snowfalls, while the south experiences warmer summers and mild winters. Boise, the capital, has chilly winters and hot summers. Lightweights for the summer with cover-up for cool nights and heavyweights for the winter. Travellers will need extra clothes when travelling in the mountains in summer or winter."

Springfield.","Illinois takes its name from Illiniwek Confederation, an alliance of several Native American tribes, who resided in Illinois around the 16th and 17th centuries. It wasn’t until the late 17th century that the state was discovered by Europeans, when in 1673 French explorers Jaccques Marquette and Louis Jolliet led an expedition along the Mississippi and Illinois rivers. As a result the area remained under French rule until 1763, when it was passed to the British after the French and Indian War. Illinois then became part of the United States when it acquired the Northwest Territory in 1783. In 1779 the United Illinois and Wabash Land Company was formed to purchase land from the Native American population still residing in the state. Both British and American officials however, refused to recognise the land purchases, disputing their legality, and the company later folded, leaving the newly formed national government to buy land from the Native American population in the early 19th century. In 1818, Illinois became the 21st state admitted to the US, and the remaining Native Americans living in the area were forced out as settlement began in the southern portion of the state. This era also saw the opening of the Erie Canal in 1825, which provided an easy route to the Midwest, and a huge influx of people from the east rushing to the newly booming port and railway hub of Chicago. In the mid-19th century, Illinois came to the forefront of national attention as Abraham Lincoln battled Stephen Douglas for a seat in the US Senate and lost; two years later, the pair fought again for the presidency, and this time Lincoln, an Illinois native, was victorious. That same year, 1861, six states seceded from the Union and formed the Confederacy, and the Civil War began. After the war, industry in Illinois, and especially Chicago, began booming. Manufacturing and meatpacking took over the city, and Chicago became a massive hub not only for the state, but the country. Illinois was devastated by the Great Chicago Fire in 1871 that burnt an area of around 9 sq km (3.3 sq miles) down to the ground but the state proved resilient and the early 1900s saw many changes in Illinois, with positive reforms benefiting workers and women - the state became a production hub for aircrafts and ammunition during WWII. Today, Illinois is a hub of activity for the entire US Midwest. Chicago is the third most populous city in the country, and is a retail, industrial, and manufacturing hub that has supported the state economy for decades. The state’s most recent claim to fame is as home to 44th US President Barack Obama, who attended the University of Chicago and was the senator of the state from 1997 to 2008 before taking office. Christianity is the most prevalent religion in Illinois, with the major denominations being Roman Catholicism followed by Baptist. The state also has a relatively large and growing Muslim population, with smaller Jewish and Buddhist, and Hindu groups. A common misconception is that the majority of Illinois’ population lives in Chicago. However, over three quarters of the state’s population lives outside of the Chicago areas, and many in other cities like Aurora, Rockford, or Springfield. Residents of Illinois, like many others in the Midwest, are traditionally considered polite, friendly, and adverse to confrontation. English is the official and most widely spoken language in Illinois. The state, however, has a considerably large Spanish-speaking population centred around the Chicago area, making up nearly 10% of the state population.

north-america,united-states-of-america,"Indiana accelerates to the max during its annual motor-racing extravaganza, but beyond the speedway, this is a gentle state of sprawling fields, pretty countryside and all-American small towns. Adjoining Lake Michigan to the north, Indiana features deep valleys, cornfields that extend from horizon to horizon, foothills and vast farmlands. The state is home to peaceful Amish communities, covered bridges, Indian mounds and the famous Indy 500 motor-racing legend. The Indianapolis 500 is more than a car race however. It’s a gigantic festival, with camping, glamping and two weeks of qualifying races before the main event. Pick-up trucks pull up at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, pop open their boots, and unload beer and barbecues for pre-race tailgating. Scantily clad fans party hard with live DJs and performers in the Snake Pit. And a massive parade of kaleidoscopic floats, giant balloons and marching bands takes place downtown on the eve of the final race. At the opposite end of the speed spectrum, Amish horse-drawn buggies rattle along rural lanes in Northern Indiana, where life takes a distinctly slower pace. A Heritage Trail weaves through thriving historic towns crammed with antiques stores, flea markets and turn-of-the-century buildings. For two weeks in August, half the state seems to land in Indianapolis once again for the Indiana State Fair, a massive agricultural spectacle blending animal shows with live concerts and fairground rides (no, that doesn't mean cows on the teacups). Thrill-seekers are also well catered for in Indiana’s great outdoors.

Previously inhabited solely by Native American tribes, including the Iroquois and Algonquian, French traders had established Tassinong as a trading post by 1673. In the late 1600s and early 1700s, the French established a vital trade route along the Maumee and Wabash rivers that connected southern Louisiana with Canada. To combat the encroaching British colonies and deter Native American rebellion, the French created several forts along the route, including Fort Miamis. The British gained initial control of the territory after the French and Indian War ended in 1763, and had full control after the American Revolution. Modern day Indiana became part of the Northwest Territory in 1787 and in 1800 the Indiana Territory was created. The Territory of Indiana was replaced by the state of Indiana in 1816 after a constitutional convention met and wrote the state’s first constitution.  The state population steadily increased over time and Indianapolis was chosen as the new state capital in 1820. During the Civil War, Indiana, who had forbidden slavery in their first constitution, sided with the Union. The state contributed greatly to the war effort, and the Battle of Croydon took place on Indiana soil. After the war in the 1880s, natural gas was discovered in northern Indiana, leading to an economic boom. The state was also the leading developer and producer of medication, thanks to the founding of pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly & Co. The Indianapolis Motor Speedway was completed in 1909, and for a few years Indianapolis rivalled Detroit in automobile production. During this period, the Indianapolis 500, which is still today a celebrated event in the state, began and became a fiercely competitive forum for auto racing companies. After a downward turn during WWI and WWII, the Indianan economy picked back up in the 1950s and 60s. The auto and pharmaceutical industries continued to thrive in Indiana and the state became much more urban, with dramatically growing populations in several cities. Today, Indiana is home to major sports teams and event, has a diverse economy, and many metropolis areas. It has transformed from a small French trading post to an integral part of the American culture and economy. Like most of the US, the largest religious group in Indiana is Christian, comprised of mostly of Roman Catholics but also Protestant denominations including Baptists, Methodists, and Lutheran. Jews, Muslims, other religions and non-religious groups comprise the remainder of the population. Basketball is not only a sport in Indiana, but part of the culture. The historically successful Indiana University basketball team is loved across the state and locals are born and raised to love the sport. English is the official language and most widely spoken throughout the state, though a small but growing Spanish-speaking population resides in Indiana as well. There is a fairly noticeable difference between the accents of different regions, with the southern accent similar to that of the southern US and the northern region with a traditional Midwestern accent.",Mild to cold winters and hot summers.

Iowa has a veritable pick and mix of road trips. The Mississippi River winds down the state’s eastern border; along its shore, the Great River Road passes 19th-century river towns, prehistoric Indian mounds, chugging paddleboats, and rocky cliffs, where you can catch sight of soaring bald eagles in winter. Alternatively, you might discover Iowa’s Danish and German heritage on the Western Skies Scenic Byway or drift around the Driftless Area, a region of Iowa renowned for its limestone bluffs and tree-blanketed valleys. Or how about a jaunt down Route 6, which winds 5,877km (3,652 miles) from Massachusetts to California? Iowa’s chunk boasts its share of quirky roadside attractions, including the world’s oldest ice cream fountain and a 5m-tall (16ft) gas station man. Iowa’s wacky sights don’t stop there.

After much changing of hands, the territory ended up under US control after the Louisiana Purchase from France in 1803. After defeating the Sauk, Fox, and Winnebago (the local Native American people), the US gained more land in 1833, and Iowa opened up for settlement. Many of the settlers came from nearby states like Ohio, Pennsylvania and New York, and oftentimes were families instead of individuals. The endless prairies of the region were at first unsettling to newcomers, who were used to the rugged terrain of the more eastern Appalachia region. The prairie also presented the problem of lack of fuel from timber and lightning-fast prairie fires were a common danger. Iowa was granted statehood in 1846 and by 1860 the majority of the state had been settled and the railroad business began booming. A gateway to Chicago, Iowa became a railway hub for the Midwest, which led to a dramatic population influx during the period. In the late 1800s, Iowa became a choice destination for European immigrants, the largest group being German, but also for Italians, Swedes, Dutch and many others. The skilled immigrants (mainly German) largely contributed to the establishment of Iowa’s abundant farms. The unskilled groups of workers (largely from Italy and Croatia) worked in the quickly expanding coal mining industry. From the beginning of WWI, Iowa’s farmers saw increased production and prosperity as they contributed to the ever-demanding war effort. With the end of the war, however, many farmers had difficulty paying back loans they had used to increase their production capacity, and the Iowan economy suffered. After the devastation of the Great Depression and WWII, President Franklin Roosevelt introduced his New Deal, which introduced economic reform nationwide, greatly boosted and regenerated the suffering Iowan economy. Since WWII, Iowa has seen a steady increase in agriculture and manufacturing. Known across the country for their agricultural capabilities, Iowa produces a large portion of the nation’s corn and soybeans. Though traditionally viewed as solely an agricultural state, Iowa has diversified their economy in recent years and is home to various industries and products. Like many other states, the majority of Iowan residents identify themselves as Protestant with the largest denomination being Methodist. The second largest group is Roman Catholic, with non-religious groups and other religions comprising the rest of the population. Residents of Iowa are known for their Midwestern hospitality; everyone is talkative, friendly, and insanely courteous. In Iowa, it is considered extremely rude to not reciprocate the friendly attitude. Because Iowa is home to significant amounts of farmland, Iowans are often stereotyped as “hicks” within the US. This notion, considered rude and disrespectful, is extremely false. Iowa is home to several metropolitan areas with a large urban population and a diversified economy, focusing on multiple areas and not just agriculture. In Iowa, English is the official and most wide-spread language. There is a small population that speaks languages other than English, including Spanish, German, and French.","Hot, moist summers, cold winters and wet springs.

north-america,united-states-of-america,"Think Kansas and wicked witches, yellow-brick roads and ruby slippers may spring to mind. But as well as being the setting for The Wizard of Oz, this Midwest gem packs in Wild West history, delicious produce and a flourishing arts scene. Kansas is an agricultural powerhouse, with vast areas of land given to grain, beef cattle and buffalo. You can experience a taste (literally) of the state’s agricultural pedigree by slurping juicy peaches, tucking into farm-to-fork dinners or testing your cowboy skills on a dude ranch. Scenic byways lead through a surprising diversity of landscapes: the last remaining tallgrass prairies, wetlands teeming with birdlife, and mushroom-shaped hoodoos. Snooze and you’ll miss Kansas on Route 66, though – the state is home to just 21km (13 miles) of the legendary highway. It was through Kansas that families on the Oregon and Santa Fe trails drove their wagons west in search of new homesteads, while cowboys on the Chisholm Trail drove herds of longhorns north in search of the railroads. Cow towns like Abilene and Dodge City were born, and as whites forced Native Americans westwards, fierce battles over land erupted. Later, feuds over Kansas’ maintenance of slavery gave rise to the term ‘Bleeding Kansas’. Forts, trails and monuments scattered across the state bring this history to life. Craving some culture? Then head to Topeka, the state capital. Home to the iconic Kansas Statehouse, this gleaming copper-domed capitol offers regular tours, taking visitors up 296 steps to a balcony where phenomenal views await. But the hottest ticket in town is the North Topeka Arts District, where historic buildings have found new life as art studios, galleries and antique stores.

Eventually, the area became inhabited by Europeans; first the Spanish and then the French explored the area, trading with the local Native American tribes. This state became part of the US in 1803, when the French sold mass amounts of land to the US in the Louisiana Purchase. However, the area remained largely uninhabited until the 1820s, when travellers along the Santa Fe Trail (which ran across the state) set up trading posts and Fort Leavenworth. Despite small posts and settlements, Kansas was closed to settlers through the better part of the 1800s. The US government declared the region Indian Territory, where they resettled Native American tribes from several states across the region. The Kansas-Nebraska Act was passed in 1854, creating the Nebraska and Kansas Territories out of the previously undefined land. With the debate over slavery already harshly under way in the states, Northerners and Southerners heatedly debated whether Kansas would be a slave state. Pro-slavery Missourians flocked to Kansas over the southern border in the early 1850s, and led to the period known as “Bleeding Kansas,” a violent era between pro- and anti-slavery advocates. Kansas became a state in 1861, just in time for the start of the Civil War. After the period of “Bleeding Kansas,” the state’s anti-slavery advocates had won, and the state joined the Union during the war and contributed to the war effort with willing troops. Many settlers went to Kansas for new farming ventures, but their hopes were dashed after surveying the state’s terrain. Exacerbated by bad agricultural practices and drought, the state’s dry soil led to many dust storms, giving rise to the Dust Bowl era which began in the 1930s and temporarily wiped out farming completely in the state. Once the Dust Bowl era ended, Kansas was able to produce large quantities of grain to support war efforts in WWII. Wichita, the state’s modern capital, also became a centre for aviation production during the war. Today, Kansas’s agricultural problems are a thing of the past, and the state is one of the main producers of wheat and other grains in the US. It also ranks highly in oil and natural gas production, making it a vital contributor to the US economic success. An overwhelming proportion of Kansas’s population is Christian, with Protestant denominations like Methodist and Baptist making up the largest portion. They are closely followed by Roman Catholicism, non-religious groups, and Judaism. Like other regions of the Midwest, Kansas is famed for its generosity, hospitality, and courteousness. Not reciprocating the kind attitude of Kansans is highly rude. In popular culture, Kansas is most recognized for being home to Dorothy in the beloved movie and book, The Wizard of Oz. The movie (1939), based on L. Frank Baum’s novel (1900) is famously known for Dorothy’s ruby slippers that are now housed in the Smithsonian museum in Washington, D.C. English is Kansas’s official language and the most widely spoken language across the state. In recent years, however, a fairly large Spanish-speaking population has been growing in numbers.","The region has a continental climate with cold winters and hot summers.

The beating heart of America’s bourbon industry, visitors can sip (okay, glug) their way through the likes of Jim Beam and Maker’s Mark on tasting tours of the state's top distilleries. Much of this corn-based liquor is quaffed during the Kentucky Derby, described by plaudits as ‘the greatest two minutes in sport’. The state goes mad for this blink-and-you’ll-miss-it horse race: fancy hats are dusted off, bets are placed and mint juleps are quaffed at extraordinary speed. Held in Louisville, the Derby is part of a two-week festival, which kicks off with the USA’s biggest fireworks display, followed by a smorgasbord of events, including a marathon and steamboat race. If you’re inspired to snatch a bit of action yourself, saddle up and canter across the prairies or take a tour of a thoroughbred centre to spot future winners. Aside from riding, you can hike the Appalachian Mountains, rattle along mountain bike trails in the Daniel Boone Forest, or duck underground in Mammoth Cave, the world’s longest cave system. You can canoe gentle rivers, paddle white water rapids, or hook blue catfish in the Ohio. Or how about exploring Civil War battlefields and the birthplace of Abraham Lincoln? The soundtrack for any Kentucky trip is bluegrass, and music aficionados can track the birthplaces of such legends as Billy Ray Cyrus and Loretta Lynn along Route 23, the Country Music Highway.

The first settlements were founded in 1775 by an influx of settlers from the nearby regions of Pennsylvania and North Carolina. Kentucky was on the front line during the American Revolution, and after victory for the colonies, Kentucky County was created as a separate entity from Virginia in 1776. After years of debate over Kentucky’s fate, it became the 15th US state in 1792. In the mid-1800s, Kentucky became a new hotspot for agricultural development, and farmers from other states flocked to Kentucky. Popular crops were corn, tobacco, and horses and mules. Many Kentuckian tobacco farmers were lured from Maryland and Virginia by the prospect of better soil and larger profits. Kentucky’s other large industry was horses, and Louisville became home to the famous Kentucky Derby in 1875.   During the Civil War, Kentucky remained neutral, but with strong Union sympathies. It was not until the Confederacy invaded Columbus, Kentucky, that the state officially declared allegiance with Union forces. After a period of political turmoil resulting in the assassination of the governor in 1900, Kentucky restored order and focused on rebuilding their infrastructure until being devastated by the Great Depression of the 1920s. There was widespread unemployment across the state until President Franklin Roosevelt introduced the New Deal to stimulate the state’s horrific economy and development of roads and telephone lines continued throughout the 1930s and 40s. Racial segregation was outlawed by the Supreme Court ruling in Brown v. Board of Education in 1954, and with that, Kentucky’s public schools were integrated and undergraduate programs began accepting African American students.  Segregation ended in Kentucky completely in the mid-1960s, after supporting the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and later passing a civil rights bill in the state general assembly in 1966. Today, the state of Kentucky has diversified its economy and is now as well as holding a title for being one of the state leaders of agriculture with over 85,000 farms, the state is also one of the leading areas in the US for automobile and electricity production. In Kentucky, the majority religion is Protestant with the largest denomination being Baptist, followed by Methodists and Roman Catholics. There are also smaller groups of Jewish, Muslim and Eastern religious groups. Like many other states in the region, Kentucky is known for its laid-back, slow moving attitude. Residents are usually very friendly and hospitably, but may not rush like their counterparts in the northeastern states. English is the official and the most widely spoken language in Kentucky. As in many other states, they also have a quite small (but growing) Spanish-speaking population.","Kentucky has a temperate climate.

north-america,united-states-of-america,"A former Spanish and French colony, the southern US state of Louisiana is filled with rolling hills and scented pine forests, multicultural cities and murky swamps teeming with alligators. The Pelican State couldn’t get much more varied, from the God-fearing Protestant settlements of the north to the debauched streets of New Orleans in the south. The lively, jazz-mad, multi-ethnic melting pot of New Orleans is without doubt the major reason tourists swarm into Louisiana. It’s famed for its exotic fusion of cultures (from Native American and Afro-Caribbean to French and Spanish); its colourful Mardi Gras; thrilling live music; striking French-Creole architecture; picturesque Mississippi river setting; innovative cuisine; and unique French Quarter. Beyond New Orleans, explore the magnificent gardens and Cajun culture of Lafayette, the starting point of the Wild Azalea Trail, which takes visitors through the stunning Kisatchie National Forest. The vast waters of the Atchafalaya Basin, the largest and most remote swamp in the USA, are one of the best places to track alligators. The state capital, Baton Rouge, is a kind of New Orleans lite. Situated on the banks of the Mississippi River, it offers great food, live music and a chance to see the wondrous Capitol Building, the tallest capitol in the United States. You can also take a trip over to Avery Island, home to the world-famous Tabasco sauce factory. It has produced the red pepper sauce here since 1868 and shares the island with huge salt domes and captivating jungle gardens. Bag a bottle for a fiery memento of this spicy state. 128,593 sq km (49,650 sq miles). 4.7 million (2015). 36.3 per sq km. Baton Rouge.","Europeans first ventured into modern-day Louisiana in 1528 while Spanish explorers surveyed the land of the Mississippi River. Around 15 years later, after Hernando de Soto had followed the river to the Gulf of Mexico the land remained vacant of colonial forces until the 17th century, when French expeditions claimed the land around the Mississippi and Gulf. They established the first settlement of Fort Maurepas in 1699. The French began to establish settlements along the banks of the river, and Natchitoches and New Orleans became large river ports used to trade with the Spanish in nearby Texas. During the mid-1700s, thousands of slaves arrived in Louisiana to support the growing plantations in the region. Louisiana fell under Spanish control after the Seven Years’ War in 1763, but was returned to the French under Napoleon in 1800. Then, when Napoleon sold the territory to the then United States, modern-day Louisiana was split into the Territory of Orleans and the District of Louisiana. During this time, thousands came to America from Haiti after the revolution in 1804, creating a large Creole community in New Orleans and other parts of the region. Louisiana was admitted to the United States in 1812. New Orleans became a popular international port because of its proximity to the Mississippi; cotton and sugar were the major exports and slavery became a huge industry in New Orleans, and Louisiana as a whole. During the Civil war, Louisiana, like other southern states, seceded from the north to form the Confederate States of America. Louisiana, however, quickly fell to the Union forces and was placed under northern military supervision after slavery was abolished following the war in 1865. The large African-American population in Louisiana suffered from gross inequality throughout the late 1800s and early 1900s; they had little representation, lack of funding for schools and public services, and due to disenfranchisement, had little representation in local or federal government. Social inequality remained in Louisiana until the expansion of the Civil Rights Movement in the 1950s and 60s. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Voting Rights Act of 1965 gave African-American residents equal opportunity, and for many, the first opportunity to vote freely. In 2005, New Orleans was devastated by Hurricane Katrina, which flooded over 80% of the city and caused widespread evacuation across the state. The devastating storm, which took the lives of over 1,500 New Orleans residents, was a national tragedy and the city and state as a whole are slowly rebuilding after the destruction. An overwhelming majority of Louisiana residents identify as Christian, and the largest of that group being Roman Catholic. Protestant groups make up the rest, with Baptist and Methodist being larger denominations. Small groups of Jewish, Muslim, and Eastern religions exist as well. The Mardi Gras celebration in New Orleans is world renowned. Originally a French celebration, Mardi Gras occurs on Fat Tuesday (the day before Ash Wednesday) and huge parades occur throughout the city, and many on the famous Bourbon Street. Creole culture is very widespread throughout Louisiana. Music and food are huge parts of Creole life; Blues and jazz are popular musical styles and Creole food (similar to Cajun) is widespread in the region, with dishes like gumbo (a Creole seafood stew) and jambalaya (sausage and seafood cooked with rice and stock) being popular. Louisiana does not have an official language, though the majority of residents speak English. French is also very prevalent in the region, and French Creole and Spanish Creole are still spoken in some areas.","Humid and subtropical. Milder in spring, autumn and winter.

north-america,united-states-of-america,"Moose the size of mammoths, lobster so fresh you could revive them, sweeping sandy beaches, rugged cliffs, verdant pine forests, and mountains as far as the eye can see: welcome to Maine. Suffice to say natural wonders abound, but the jewel in Maine’s crown has to be Acadia National Park on Mount Desert Island, where cyclists and horses pootle along historic carriage roads, climbers tackle lofty sea cliffs and hikers follow forest trails tramped by American Indians. Between October and March, you can snap the sunrise before anyone else in the country from Cadillac Mountain, the highest peak on the US Atlantic coast. After dark, gaze at the star-speckled sky above Bar Harbor, which resembles an out-of-reception TV set. Extraordinary. Further south, Maine’s coast delivers the quintessential New England seaside experience, complete with historic lighthouses, hidden coves, lobster shacks and giant sweeps of sand. Inland, hardcore hikers complete the 3,510km (2,181 miles) Appalachian Trail at Katahdin. Maine’s section is no walk in the park: the toughest stretch of the entire trail covers 452km (281 miles) of gnarly tree roots, squelchy bogs, treacherous stream crossings and precipitous climbs. The activities don’t stop there. Leaf peepers scale the lookout tower on Bald Mountain to gaze at a Jackson Pollock-esque splatter of autumnal colours. Canoeists paddle the Northern Forest Canoe Trail, connecting the waterways of New York, Vermont, Quebec, New Hampshire and Maine. Rafters bounce through class 4 rapids in the Kennebec Gorge. And golfers tee off at Sugarloaf Mountain, then trade places with skiers in winter. If you’re craving city life, head to Portland, a neat coastal metropolis buzzing with refreshing microbreweries, alfresco eateries and terrific arts performances. ‘Life’s good here,’ reads the city slogan. It’s hard to disagree. 87,381 sq km (33,738 sq miles). 1.3 million (2015). 15.2 per sq km. Augusta.","The French were the first to set foot in modern day Maine, forming a settlement on St. Croix Island, a small island off the coast of the state, in 1604. They formed a permanent trading post in Castine in 1613, whilst a rival post was set up by English colonists known as the Plymouth Colony, near Penobscot Bay in the 1620s. Sir Ferdinando Gorges and John Mason were given a land patent in 1622 for modern day Maine, and in the 1630s, settlements began popping up along the Maine’s southern coastline. During the American Revolution in the late 1700s, Maine was a hotspot for American patriotism and used their large shipbuilding industry to support the colonists’ war efforts. Maine created their state constitution in 1819 and shortly later in 1820 was granted statehood from Massachusetts. The state became a centre for industrialization in the 1800s as well; lumber, shipbuilding, textile, and paper industries expanded across the state while the agriculture in Maine also flourished. During the Civil War, Maine strongly supported the Union cause, seeing as Hannibal Hamlin, Abraham Lincoln’s Vice President, was from the state. Many residents joined the Union troops, and in relation to their small population size, contributed the largest proportion of troops of any state. After the war, Maine saw an influx of immigrants from Ireland and French Canada because of their booming industry. Tourism also became a large part of the industry in the mid-17th century because of its pristine coastlines and beautiful scenery. In modern Maine, Kennebunkport is most notable as the location of the Bush family’s (former Presidents George H.W. and George W. Bush) country home. In the early 1900s, the majority of Maine’s population lived in the countryside, though there were some booming urban centres. Portland and Lewiston joined the ever-growing automobile industry and the production of radios, washing machines, and other electrical appliances also contributed to the cities’ success. Electrification of farm work aided agriculture after WWII; the number of farms increased and dairy farming became more widespread. Environmental reform also became a strong part of Maine culture, with the state leading the charge against air pollution in the 1980s. Modern day Maine is one of the US’s leaders in environmental legislation. With comprehensive waste and reuse legislation, there is low pollution and the state owns and preserves much of the wild land. Maine is considered one of the least religious states in the US; however, of people who identify as religious, the majority are Roman Catholic, followed by large groups of Baptist and other Protestant groups. Known as “Vacationland,” Maine witnesses a large population increase during the summer months as visitors flock from across the US and around the world for the state’s beautiful coastline and beaches. Areas like York, Kennebunkport and Kittery are all popular destinations (among many others) for summer holidays. Maine does not have an official language, but like the rest of the United State, English is the most widely spoken and used language. Maine is also home to a fairly large French speaking population, with smaller groups of Spanish, German, and Chinese speakers, among several other languages.","Mild and sunny from May to October, followed by cold winters with abundant snowfall from December to April and winter temperatures averaging -10ºC (20ºF) in January.

north-america,canada,"Overlooked by many, Manitoba could be Canada’s best-kept secret, spanning Arctic tundra and sprawling prairies, a classy capital and vast swathes of wildlife-packed wilderness. At one extreme, there’s the sub-Arctic coastline at Churchill on Hudson Bay where you can spy frolicking beluga whales in summer or roaming polar bears in the autumn. At the other, there’s cosmopolitan Winnipeg, crammed with thrilling museums and fascinating historic districts. In between, there’s not much at all other than a phenomenal landscape of sweeping farmland, flowering prairies and some 100,000 lakes, which support a range of wildlife including elk, black bears, wolves, muskox, moose and various migratory birds. No wonder outdoor adventurers are in heaven, paddling the historic Hayes River, or camping at spots like Paint Lake Provincial Park for a hike to Kwasitchewan Falls. If all that open space overwhelms you, head for the city. Winnipeg is usually either blisteringly hot or bitingly cold, but don’t let the weather put you off. The city boasts Canada’s oldest public gallery as well as the Canadian Museum of Human Rights, opened in 2014 and the first national museum built for nearly 50 years. For a city plonk in the middle of the prairies, Winnipeg boasts a seriously impressive cultural line-up, including a professional ballet, symphony orchestra, theatre and opera. And who’d have thought it? Every single Canadian coin in your pocket was minted in Winnipeg. Manitoba is a huge province with comparably few residents, but the people that do live there are renowned for their friendly, hospitable natures and embrace of diversity. Winnipeg is the centre of the cultural festival Folklarama, a celebration of Canada's ethnic communities.

But who needs DC when you have Baltimore? Officially the largest independent city in the US, its landmark attraction is Inner Harbor, where fantastic museums, excellent seafood and stunning views abound. Grab a water taxi to the trendy Canton neighbourhood, with its historic houses and hip hangouts, or join football-crazy locals and cheer on the Ravens. Nestling on Chesapeake Bay, the largest estuary in the US, Annapolis is Maryland’s stunning state capital. The busiest sailing destination on the Eastern Seaboard, it boasts a stunning colonial old town, charming museums and is the gateway to wildlife-rich wetlands. Further along the coast, beachcombers and bathers mingle on golden sands for old-fashioned seaside fun. You can chow down on fresh crab, take a whirl on the rides at Ocean City, or snap Assateague Island’s iconic wild ponies. Out west, anglers and boaters hole up in rustic cabins to enjoy the simple pleasures of Deep Creek Lake. Hiking and biking trails crisscross the surrounding forest, which also harbours an Olympic-standard white-water rafting course and a winter snow-tubing park. And then there’s Cumberland, the terminus for the Western Maryland Scenic Railroad, which takes passengers through the Appalachian Mountains and back to the bygone era of steam travel. Suffice to say, Maryland has much to offer. Little wonder they call it ‘America in Miniature’. 31,849 sq km (12,297 sq miles). 6 million (2015). 188.6 per sq km. Annapolis.","Prior to European settlement, various Native American groups such as the Piscataway, Patuxents, and Mattawomans inhabited present-day Maryland. It wasn’t until 1498 that the first wave of explorers sailed along the eastern coast. The royal charter for the Province of Maryland was issued to Cecilius Calvert, 2nd Baron of Baltimore, in 1632 whilst the first settlers arrived at St. Clement’s Island (in southern Maryland) in 1634. St. Mary’s City, the colonial capital, quickly became the largest settlement in Maryland. The colony quickly became predominantly Catholic, though in 1649, the Maryland Toleration Act was issued, which outlined religious tolerance in the region. In the early 1700s, the capital was moved to the quickly growing Annapolis. Shortly afterwards, a border dispute between Maryland and Pennsylvania led to the commissioning of two surveyors, Charles Mason and Jeremiah Dixon, to decide on a boundary that later became known as the Mason-Dixon Line, still recognised today. Unlike most colonies, Maryland didn’t favour independence from the British. Eventually, however, the colony gave in and agreed to ratify the new colonial government. During the Civil War, Maryland was a border state between the north and south and residents fought for both the Union and Confederacy; many plantation owners however, had already freed their slaves before the fighting began. After the war, a deep division existed between those who sided with the north and those with the south. Many attempted to discrimination against and disfranchise African-Americans in Maryland. The attempts by white supremacists, however, failed due to widespread public support of equality. Maryland was greatly affected by WWI; home to many existing military bases, Maryland was a hotspot for the war effort and many great victory gardens and adhered to the strict rations. Today, Baltimore is one of the country’s largest ports and employees a large portion of Maryland’s workers. Additionally, the state’s close proximity to Washington, D.C., makes it home to countless government employees in several fields, including research, defence, and administration. During the colonial area, Maryland was one of the only colonies to have a Roman Catholic majority, and that still holds true today. The majority of religious residents identify as Roman Catholic, with Protestant denominations like Baptist and Methodist making up the majority of the remaining residents. There is a fairly large Jewish population with several other smaller religious groups. Maryland has a very large sports culture, with many different professional and college athletic teams. Two National Football League teams play in the state, the Baltimore Ravens and the Washington Redskins. The Baltimore Orioles are the Major League Baseball franchise in the state, and the Washington Capitals represent the National Hockey League.  Because of the multitude of professional sports franchises in the state, many across the state are diehard fans of one team or another. Maryland is often recognized for its fresh, delicious blue crabs. They are also known for their specific preparation of the crab; they are often steamed and seasoned with Old Bay seasoning (a special herb and spice blend developed in Maryland). Though Maryland does not have an official language, English is the most widely used language in the state. In the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area, there is also a fairly large Spanish speaking population.","Hot, humid summers and mild, damp winters.

You can explore the nation's early history, walk in the steps of the Pilgrims, tour battleships, catch the excitement of a Boston Red Sox baseball game or be awed by whales drifting along the coastline. The gateway to New England, Massachusetts was the destination of the Mayflower in 1620 and site of the Boston Tea Party, which helped ignite the American Revolution in 1773. Boston’s Freedom Trail is a must-do, but Massachusetts is more than a history lesson. From masterpieces at the Museum of Fine Arts to a world-renowned symphony orchestra, Boston’s cultural scene is world class. (It has a cheeky side too – you can eye up complete disasters at the Museum of Bad Art.) Across the river, Cambridge is brainiac central, where both Harvard and MIT show off their share of fascinating museums. With all these genius academics come hip neighbourhoods buzzing with bakeries, bookshops and indie boutiques. Cape Cod curls like a jester’s shoe and serves up simple seaside pleasures: unspoiled beaches, fresh lobster, excellent hiking, terrific sailing and a golf course for every week of the year. It’s one of the world’s best whale-watching spots – minkes, humpbacks, pilots and blue whales all swim offshore.

Boston.","Native American tribes were the original inhabitants of Massachusetts until the first European settlement was established by the Pilgrims, who landed at Plymouth aboard the Mayflower in 1620. The Pilgrims, who had emigrated from England to the New World to escape religious persecution, developed friendly relations with the Native American people in the area; it is this friendship which is the basis of the one o the biggest US holidays, Thanksgiving. The Massachusetts Bay Colony was founded by Puritans, who also fled England looking for religious freedom. The Puritans founded Salem and Boston in the mid-1600s. After many years of land disputes with the Native Americans and the Crown in England, King William and Queen Mary chartered the Province of Massachusetts Bay in 1691, which included the former Massachusetts Bay Colony, Maine, and Nova Scotia. Massachusetts became the centre for the growing group of patriots in the colonies who wanted freedom from England. Boston was the epicentre for revolutionaries, with iconic leaders like John and Samuel Adams leading the charge. It was also the site of the historic Boston Tea Party in 1773, when colonists protesting the Tea Act unloaded all of the tea from an East India Company ship which had docked at the Boston Harbour. After the colonies won independence, Massachusetts wrote a state constitution banning slavery and eliminating religious requirements for local office. The most liberal of the states, Massachusetts also became an industrial leader in the mid-19th century, with textile, paper, and tool factories cropping up around the state’s urban centres of Boston and Springfield. As the railways continued to improve after the Civil War, Massachusetts continued to be a leader of industry; Springfield was a major automobile centre and had the largest public transportation system in the country by 1905. The state suffered widespread unemployment during the era of the Great Depression and the state-wide factory system collapsed. After WWI, the economy picked back up and after WWII, Massachusetts was again a leader, but this time in technology as home to research facilities and defence contractors. Today, Massachusetts, and especially Boston, is a leader in the technology industry. Home to Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and Harvard University, the brightest young minds in the US flock to Boston to research and develop new technologies. The majority of Massachusetts’s population is Catholic, due to large-scale immigration of Irish immigrants in the mid-1800s; a large portion of these immigrants and their descendants still reside in the Boston area. Protestant denominations make up the next largest group, including Presbyterian and Episcopalian groups. Massachusetts is also home to smaller groups of Jewish and Muslim populations. All of New England is recognized for their varying accents, but Bostonians are especially notorious. They often drop the “r” sound after vowels, and the mocking phrase, “Pahk the cah in Hahvahd yahd” is used nationwide to imitate the unmistakable Boston accent. Boston’s team in Major League Baseball, the Boston Red Sox, are dearly and fiercely beloved throughout all of New England. They are in a vicious rivalry with New York City’s team, the New York Yankees, and it is one of the oldest sports rivalries in the country. Massachusetts does not have an official language, but English is the most widespread language across the state. However, around the urban centres of Boston and Springfield are large and growing Spanish and Portuguese speaking populations.","Warm and sunny from May to October, followed by cold winters.

This huge country encompasses epic landscapes; from northern deserts and snowy peaks of the central sierra, to the jungle highlands of southern Chiapas and the beaches of the Yucatán Peninsula. Pre-Colombian civilisations made their mark with the vast pyramids of Teotihuacán, stunning temples of Chichén Itzá and countless other archaeological wonders. The Spanish heritage has also been well preserved, with charming towns built around shady plazas and whitewashed churches; San Miguel de Allende, Guanajuato and Dolores Hidalgo are treasures of the central Colonial Heartland. Mexico today is a booming modern economy, led by its gargantuan capital, Mexico City. Once you adjust to the relentless pace of life in this metropolis, you can indulge in world-class museums, dine in exquisite restaurants, cut shapes in clubs and barter at sprawling markets. Beyond the modern cities, lie sleepy villages where age-old customs and ancient beliefs endure. San Cristobal de las Casas is a major hub, ringed by indigenous villages, with churches combining pagan beliefs with Roman Catholicism. Across the country, lively festivals reflect this blending of faiths, most famously at the Day of the Dead ceremony. For visitors seeking outdoor adventure, Mexico delivers. Nature lovers can go whale watching in Baja California, reef diving off the Yucatán Peninsula and trekking through the jungle to glowing blue lagoons bordering Guatemala. Adrenaline activities are in amply supply too, from canyoning in Veracruz and hang-gliding in Hidalgo to volcano climbing, caving and river rafting. One of the great joys of a visit to Mexico is its cuisine. Emulated around the world, its crispy tacos, mole sauces and burritos are amongst the mouth-watering specialities on offer.

President Andrés Manuel López Obrador since 2018.","Mexico's early civilizations remain a source of pride to modern Mexicans. The pyramids of Teotihuacán, north of Mexico City, attest to the extraordinary achievement of a society that flourished around the same time as the Roman Empire then mysteriously disappeared. The legacy of the great Maya civilisation continues to reverberate amongst its descendants on the Yucatán Peninsula and in southeast Mexico. These and other great civilizations had developed before the Aztecs established their empire at Tenochtitlán, the predecessor of modern Mexico City. The Maya, above all, asserted their hegemony over central Mexico and beyond, through present-day Central America. When the Spanish arrived on Mexico's Gulf Coast in 1517, the Aztec Empire was in disarray and widely reviled by its far-flung subjects. This situation greatly facilitated the Spanish conquest of Mexico and within two years the European invaders had taken over the Aztec domains. Catholic missionaries arrived in the new Spanish colony to evangelize the masses of Indians. Thus were planted the seeds of the “mestizaje”, the blending of European and indigenous peoples and cultures that still characterizes the complex racial mix of today's Mexico. The three centuries of Spanish rule that followed were primarily devoted to exploiting the colony's vast silver reserves and enslaving the populace to that end. The ensuing decades of political instability culminated in the regime of Porfirio Díaz (1876-1910), which modernised Mexico's industry and infrastructure while trampling on the civil and economic rights of most Mexicans. This state of affairs sparked the Mexican Revolution (1910-20), a devastating conflict that ushered in a version of democratic government with a single political party, the PRI, at the helm for the next seven decades. Electoral reforms implemented by President Ernesto Zedillo (1994-2000) facilitated the election of an opposition-party candidate, Vicente Fox, for the first time in the country's modern history. Fox’s party, PAN (Partido Accion Nacional), represented a broad platform of centrist, Catholic principles, which challenged PRI’s historic dominance Mexico celebrated the bicentennial of its independence from Spain in 2010 but remained preoccupied by a vicious conflict against and between bands of drug cartels. The tough stance advocated by President Felipe Calderón, and continued by his successor, Enrique Peña Nieto, has taken an unprecedented human toll and sadly tarnished the country's international image.

Altitude is a determining factor with regards to the weather, with cooler temperatures at higher elevations (Mexico City, Puebla, San Cristóbal de las Casas) and warmer, tropical weather as you descend to sea level (Guadalajara, Cuernavaca, Cancun). Along the Pacific and Caribbean coasts, the winter months (November-February) are warm and sunny. Many Europeans visit during this time to escape winter in their homelands. The summer months (June-August), meanwhile, are very hot and humid with heavy rain showers and the occasional hurricane. October and November are perhaps the best months to visit the interior, after the rains have ended and everything is still green. This varies from area to area.

Michigan has more natural features than it knows what to do with. Once used by fur traders and loggers, Michigan’s 300-plus rivers are now perfect paddling territory. Then there are the 5,149km (3,200 miles) of shoreline and 11,000 inland lakes, where you can hook hefty trout and monster salmon or take a cruise. Oh, and did we mention the 120,000 hectares (300,000 acres) of sand dunes? Backcountry adventures await in Isle Royale National Park on Lake Superior, a craggy wilderness home to wolves and moose. In winter, thousands of miles of forested cross-country trails bring skiers out in force across the state. Michigan has its share of urban chic too. Cosmopolitan Grand Rapids is an ultra-cool city with a thriving arts scene, farm-to-fork dining, and more than a dozen craft breweries. From there, it’s a handy half-hour jaunt to the sandy swimming beaches of Lake Michigan, where you can recline on shining shores, or flip a coin for the designated driver role on the lakeshore wine trail. On the opposite side of the Lower Peninsula, Detroit may once have been associated with urban decay, but today, the state’s biggest metropolis is Michigan’s comeback kid. You’ll find the city’s downtown and inner city neighbourhoods revitalised by creative entrepreneurs and abounding with hip cafés, cocktail hangouts, techie start-ups, and urban farms. 250,493 sq km (96,716 sq miles). 9.9 million (2016). 67.1 per sq km. Lansing.","Set in a quiet northeastern corner of the US, it’s no wonder the first Europeans to venture into Michigan were French explorers from Canada. Under orders from Samuel de Champlain, French explorer Étienne Brûlé ventured into Michigan in 1620. Père Jacques Marquette formed the first settlement in the area in the late 1600s, and several other trading posts and towns were established as the decades passed.  After the Seven Years’ War, Michigan fell under British control. The Native Americans tribes in the area were displeased with the way British authorities treated them, and thus banded together to attack Fort Detroit in 1763. This began the famous Pontiac’s War, which lasted over three years and forced the British to return the land to Canada.   During the American Revolution, control of Michigan was given to the newly independent United States. Michigan became part of the Northwest Territory in 1787 and then part of the Indiana Territory in 1800. In 1805, it was finally declared the Michigan Territory.   After the opening of the Erie Canal in 1825, Michigan experienced a population boom. The canal, which connected the Great Lakes with the Atlantic Ocean, quickened trade and increased industry throughout the region. In 1837, Michigan was signed into statehood by President Andrew Jackson.   The state saw another significant population influx in the 1840s, when metal ores were discovered in the area. A large group of Cornish miners flocked to the state, helping Michigan to become a national leader in copper and iron ore production by the end of the 1800s.   In the early 1900s, Michigan became a huge leader in the automobile industry. The Ford Motor Company was founded in Detroit in 1903, and General Motors and Chrysler are also based in the area.To this day, the automobile industry has a huge presence in Michigan.   During the Great Depression, Michigan’s economy suffered like the rest of the country, and many employees of the auto and mining industries were without work. When the US entered WWII, however, production picked back up and new jobs were created across the state.   Throughout the 1970s competition from foreign competitors diminished the American auto industry, causing a gradual decline in Michigan’s economy. Since then, the Michigan government has been pushing to bring new industry into the state to stimulate economic growth. Did you know? Michigan is overwhelmingly Christian, with the bulk of religious residents identifying themselves as Roman Catholic. Large Protestant groups of Presbyterian and Lutheran residents exist as well. There is also a small but growing group of Muslims, along with other minority religions. Because Michigan’s borders form an outline akin to the shape of a right hand, people often use their hand as an indicator of location. If you ask someone for driving directions or where a different city is within the state, they will hold up their right hand and point to the current location and the location in question to provide an estimation of distance.","Summers are warm with cool nights. Winters are cold, especially around the Great Lakes where conditions can be severe. This, however, makes for great conditions for winter sports. Warm winter clothes are needed in the coldest months. Light-to-medium weights are advised for the summer."
north-america,united-states-of-america,"It’s all about the water in Minnesota. If you visited a different lake every day here it would take more than three decades to see them all – yup, there are 11,842 lakes to choose from, meaning virtually limitless opportunities for aquatic adventures: from waterskiing (invented in this very state) to paddlewheel boat trips, there’s a watersport for everyone. Grab a kayak, cram it with camping gear, and explore 2,400km (1,500 miles) of routes in the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness. Or venture into Voyageurs National Park for a Swallows and Amazons-style experience, exploring hidden islands and trails, and sleeping on a houseboat or lakeside cabin. Landlubbers can stick to pedalling disused railways and lakeside paths or hurtling down the phenomenal mountain bike trails at Cuyana’s old iron ore mine. Golfers have the pick of hundreds of scenic courses, including the 2016 Ryder Cup host, Hazeltine National Golf Club. In the depths of winter, Minnesota completely freezes over, and the lakes and land are transformed into sparkling playgrounds crisscrossed with snowmobiling, cross-country skiing and dog-sledding trails, while hardy anglers bundle up for a spot of ice fishing. And if all that open space has you hankering after some urban action, the cosmopolitan twin cities of Minneapolis and St Paul are home to the humongous Mall of America, the architectural masterpiece that is the Minnesota State Capitol, and an unstoppable craft brewery boom.

St Paul.","The French established relations with the Native Americans in 1671 when they created treaties with several tribes allowing trade. In 1721, Fort Beauharnois was built to accommodate the large number of explorers passing through the area searching for the Northwest Passage. The area remained mostly uncolonised and largely unexplored until part of modern day Minnesota was given to the United States after the American Revolution; they acquired the rest with the Louisiana Purchase in 1803. Fort Snelling was established in 1819 and became a major outpost for the region, which was still predominantly unexplored until 1851, when treaties between the government and Native American tribes opened up the land of modern Minnesota for settlement. Minnesota’s two largest cities, Saint Paul and Minneapolis, began developing in the mid- to late-1800s. The cities, known today as the “Twin Cities” because of their close proximity, quickly became the state’s epicentre with Saint Paul as the governmental capital and Minneapolis as the unofficial industrial centre. Today, the combined metropolitan area is home to over half of the state’s population. Minnesota was signed into statehood in 1857 after much debate in the US Senate about the state’s slavery laws; Minnesota ended up being a free state, and joined the Union when the Civil War began. Once the war ended, settlement in Minnesota increased because of the railroad industry and a booming agricultural sector emerged in the region at the turn of the century. The Great Depression hit Minnesota especially hard, causing severe layoffs in the newly developed mining industry. A drought disabled agricultural profitability. Like many other states, WWII stimulated the economy and created countless jobs. The Twin Cities Ordnance Plant was built by the US government to produce munitions during the war and Fort Snelling was a reception centre for new recruits after the draft began. Today, farming has become a large industry in Minnesota and the state is a hotspot for innovation in the field; it is the largest producer of corn in the country. Mining, logging, and retail are all also large parts of the modern economy. The largest religious denomination in Minnesota is Roman Catholic, closely followed by Lutheran and other Protestant groups. Smaller groups of Jewish, Muslim, and Buddhist groups compose the remainder of the religious population in Minnesota. Minnesota is infamous across the United States for their stereotypical “Minnesota nice” behaviour, characterized by being overly courteous, polite, and friendly. The term applies not only to in-person interactions, but applies to driving as well; in Minnesota, drivers are often considered overly well-mannered, like stopping to let someone into a different lane or waving on turning cars out of turn. The stereotypical Minnesotan behaviour is widely representing in popular culture, and most notably by Marshall Erikson in the television series How I Met Your Mother and the Coen brothers’ 1996 film Fargo. Minnesota does not have an official language, though a bill was introduced by Minnesota House Republicans in 2011 to make English the state language. English is the most widely spoken language across the state, but small Spanish, German, and other foreign language populations exist as well.","Winters are cold, often frigid in the north of the state, with adequate snow for skiing, skating, snowmobiling, ice fishing and sledding. Summers are warm, and are conducive to summer sports, including swimming, fishing, camping and hiking. Minnesota only rarely experiences heat waves or drought. Warm winter clothes are needed in the coldest months. Light- to mediumweights are advised for the summer."
north-america,united-states-of-america,"Mississippi serves up a veritable feast of hearty food, outdoor adventure and fascinating history. Running deep like the Mississippi River, the state’s narrative has been shaped by American Indians, European traders and pioneer settlers, whose tales of triumph and toil litter the Natchez Trace Parkway, a fascinating heritage route between Natchez and Nashville. Vicksburg also delivers a huge slice of history. A key battle ground during the American Civil War (1861-1865), the conflict is commemorated with memorials and monuments at the Vicksburg National Military Park. Meanwhile, the Mississippi Freedom Trail pays poignant tribute to the racial strife that erupted here during the 1960s, when the state was a major player in the Civil Rights movement. The architecture is no less dramatic. From 19th-century antebellum plantations to the eccentric Ohr-O’Keefe Museum of Art, the state abounds with eye-catching design. But nothing beats Mississippi’s stunning landscapes, which have inspired a wealth of artistic talent, from William Faulkner and Eudora Welty to Elvis Presley and BB King. The arts scene still thrives, with indie film festivals, honky tonks and Pulitzer Prize-winning authors lending the state a creative vibe. Outdoor enthusiasts are well catered for in Mississippi: its balmy climate and vast wilderness are ripe for adventure. Bike a section of the 4,800km (3,000-mile) Mississippi River Trail, which scythes through 10 states, cycle through the Appalachian foothills on the Tanglefoot Trail, or set up camp in one of the state’s six national forests. Mississippi’s culinary offerings also deserve exploration. State specialities range from fresh-from-the-Gulf shrimp and Delta hot tamales to super-sweet slices of Mississippi mud pie.

The French, however, were the first to lay claim to the territory and established the first permanent European settlement. Britain gained control of the land in 1763 and passed it over to US control in 1783 after the American Revolution. The Mississippi Territory was created in 1804, and in 1817 Mississippi was declared the 20th state in the Union. After statehood, Mississippi became a leader in the cotton industry and as a result, had an overwhelming slave population to operate the large plantations. Plantation owners became increasingly prosperous over the course of the 1800s and wielded excessive power in the state government because of their wealth. When the Civil War began, Mississippi seceded and joined the Confederate States of America. Because plantation owners had a lot at stake, many Mississippians joined the Confederate troops to fight the Union. The Confederates quickly began losing steam against the more organized Union, and the war broke down the Mississippian standard of living until the Confederacy was defeated in 1865. After the war, the railroad system was slowly rebuilt and the cotton plantations expanded even further across the state. Mississippi was the epitome of the Deep South, and despite newly granted legal freedoms, African Americans were severely discriminated against. Disfranchisement prevented them from voting, and by 1900, the Jim Crow system had taken over the state. Lynchings were not uncommon and racial segregation legislation made this unfair treatment legal. Mississippi became the epicentre of the Civil Rights Movement and the summer of 1964 became known as the Freedom Summer. Civil Rights groups brought out-of-state students to Mississippi to teach in Freedom Schools, register voters, and generally campaign for equal rights. Shortly later, the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was passed by Congress and banned discrimination in public accommodations, education, and the workplace. Today, Mississippi is the second-largest producer of cotton in the nation, beaten only by Texas. Agriculture remains its largest industry, with large crops of soybeans, corns, rice, and sugar cane. The state is also the world’s largest producer of catfish. In 2011, Gallup classified Mississippi as the USA’s most religious state. Baptists are the largest denomination by a landslide, followed by Methodist and other Protestant denominations. There is a small Roman Catholic population and very small groups minority religions like Judaism and Islam. As in many parts of the southern US, those in Mississippi are incredibly polite with impeccable manners. ‘Ma’am’ or ‘Miss’ is usually used to address women and ‘Sir’ is used for men. English is the official language of Mississippi and has been since 1987. It is by far the most widely spoken language, with only a minute portion of the population speaking foreign languages such as Spanish or French.","Mississippi's climate has short, mild winters and hot, humid summers. During the winter, coastal temperatures are warmer than in the north, with January averages ranging from 5°C (41°F) to 11°C (52°F). Steamy summers in the south can hover in the 30°C (90°F), often with 90% humidity. Summer months require light cottons and linens. Heavier weight clothing is needed for the winter months."
north-america,united-states-of-america,"Sophisticated cities, lazy summer road trips and adventures in the Ozark Mountains: all this, and more, awaits in Missouri. Arrive in St Louis, the state’s largest city, and the distinctive Gateway Arch, which soars above the Mississippi River, might be the first thing you spot. But the city is also home to the stunning Forest Park, a fantastic art museum and more microbreweries than you can shake a stick at. On the other side of the state lies Kansas City. Your mouth starts to water as you approach this western Missouri metropolis and snatch a whiff of its legendary barbecue joints, hickory-smoked meat and dry-rub ribs. It’s a sports-mad city that also lays claim to a thriving arts scene and terrific live music. Away from the hustle and bustle, Missouri is ripe for road trips and outdoor adventure. You won’t find it marked on any modern maps, but historic Route 66 slices southwest from St Louis, mostly replaced today by I-44. Explore underground caves, snap colourful murals, stroll through turn-of-the-century towns, and pull up for the night at vintage motels. Missouri has its share of quirky roadside attractions, too. The biggest is surely the rather incongruous Titanic Museum Attraction in Branson, a half-scale replica of the ship (complete with iceberg poking into its hull) where you can walk the Grand Staircase and cabins, stand on a sloping deck and touch chilly water for the full sinking experience. For a smaller-scale (and more realistic) floating adventure, you can raft or canoe the Current or Jacks Fork Rivers.

Jefferson City.","Missouri remained largely unexplored until the late 1600s when Frenchmen Jacques Marquette and Louis Jolliet ventured along the Mississippi River in 1673. As the Mississippi and Missouri rivers became major channels for trade, the French began establishing permanent settlements in the region. Missouri was absorbed by the Company of the West in 1719 and became part of the Illinois Territory. Modern day Missouri was still chiefly uninhabited by the mid-1700s. Small settlements at Kaskaski, Fort de Chartres and Ste. Genevieve were created, but overall the population remained small.  The few who lived in the area were mainly wheat, corn, and tobacco farmers. After the Seven Years’ War, French control of the territory passed into Spanish hands. St. Louis, today one of Missouri’s largest and most well known cities, was established by Gilbert Antoine de St. Maxent and Pierre Laclède in 1764 just before the French gave up power in Missouri. After the colonies won independence from Britain, Missouri witnessed a large influx of American immigrants. Initially opposed to the idea, the Spanish began advertising for cheap land and low taxes in Missouri to encourage American settlers when the Spanish went to war with England in 1796. France regained control of Missouri in 1800, and the land was sold in the Louisiana Purchase to the US in 1803. The Missouri Territory was created in 1812 and in 1821 Missouri became the 24th state in the Union. In the years leading up to statehood, Missouri saw a rapid influx of settlers that drastically improved the local economy. Missouri sided with the Union in the Civil War, and was a strategic state in the battle between north and south. Many battles took place in the state among Union forces and rebel Missourians who, against the state’s demands, sided with the Confederacy. After the Civil War, Missouri became an important trading centre; expansion of the railroads from the west increased the population and trade, and trading and merchants travelled along the nearby Mississippi and Missouri rivers, making St. Louis and economic hotspot of the era. In the early 20th century, the Missouri economy took off; manufacturing, agriculture, and mining were all integral parts of the state’s industry. The Great Depression hit Missouri hard, manufacturing fell, sales decreased, and unemployment rose drastically. During WWII, many of these economic troubles eased, with much of the population moved from rural areas to urban for work. Agriculture and manufacturing both picked up and restored the state to its pre-Depression industrial achievement. Missouri is an overwhelmingly Protestant region, with Baptist being the largest denomination by far. Methodist and Presbyterian are also large Protestant groups. The state has a fairly large Catholic population, along with smaller groups of Jewish, Eastern, and Muslim populations. Famed author Mark Twain is a Missouri native. His world renown novels, The Adventures of Tom Sawyer and The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn are set in Hannibal, Missouri. Today, enthusiasts of Twain’s works can visit the city, where many attractions are based on the two novels.  The Major League Baseball team, the St. Louis Cardinals, has a cult following in the state, but more specifically in the St. Louis area. The majority of residents are die-hard fans and will defend the baseball team fervently against any rival fans.      English is the official and most widely used language in Missouri. A small population of Spanish speaking residents also resides in the state, mostly centred around the urban areas. Smaller groups of German, French and Chinese speaking residents also live in the state, among many other language groups.","The region has the most continental climate of any area in the USA.

north-america,united-states-of-america,"Two stellar national parks, bountiful wildlife and super-friendly locals: make sure you book a return ticket to Montana, or you might be tempted to stay. Straddling the US-Canadian border, Glacier National Park is the jewel in Montana’s crown. A land of mammoth mountains and ice-hewn valleys splashed with turquoise lakes, visitors can drive over the Continental Divide via the hair-raising Going-to-the-Sun Road, or choose from more than 1,100km (700 miles) of hiking trails, which crisscross the park. A classic route is the Highline Trail, where epic vistas and sightings of bighorn sheep, marmots and grizzly bears compensate for the vertigo. Southwestern Montana is a gateway to another beauty: Yellowstone, the world’s first national park. The earth is alive here, with spewing geysers and bubbling hot springs simmering between mountains, rivers and canyons. Bison, elk, wolves and grizzlies roam this mesmerising landscape, which is worth visiting anytime of the year, particularly winter – hop on a snowmobile to see steaming thermal pools, snow ghosts and frost-mottled bison. While you’re at it, bring your skis to one of Montana’s brilliant downhill resorts. Big Sky and Whitefish are up there with the best, but befriend the locals and they will reveal a clutch of smaller, low-key hills that most visitors miss. There’s more to Montana than mountains, though. Head east to Montana’s High Plains, a region of buttes, prairies and meandering waterways. Follow the canoes of legendary explorers, Lewis and Clark, on a paddle through the Upper Missouri River Breaks National Monument or spot antelope, elk and 200 varieties of birds in the CM Russell National Wildlife Refuge.

The first large-scale European exploration of the area occurred shortly later, when the Lewis and Clark Expedition, headed by Meriwether Lewis and William Clark, set off from Missouri to explore the newly acquired land. Missionaries from St. Louis travelled to Montana in the early 1840s and established the first permanent settlement, St. Mary’s Mission. Later in mid-1800s, gold was discovered in the area, and this prompted the US to adopt the area as the Montana Territory in 1864. The railroad entered Montana in the 1880s, and brought with it a huge influx of settlement within the territory. Shortly after, in 1889, Montana was admitted as the 41st state in the USA. In the early 1900s, cattle farming and agriculture largely comprised the Montana economy; homesteaders from the Midwest flocked to Montana and the population greatly increased. Later in the 20th century, copper, timber, coal, and oil became the foundations of Montana’s industry. Mining towns cropped up all over the state; the city of Butte is a long-lasting legacy of the mining era. After WWI, Montana became home to the Montana Power Company, which owned and operated many dams across the state, many of which were on the Missouri River. Great Falls, named for its many waterfalls, also became a centre for hydropower. Since the mid-1900s, Montana has become a popular tourist destination because of Yellowstone National Park, created in 1872. The park, partially located in Montana, is considered the first national park in the world, and is home to the famous attraction of Old Faithful, a geyser within the park’s boundaries which erupts every 60-90 minutes. Montana is also home to Glacier National park, which includes parts of two different mountain ranges and a well-preserved ecosystem. Today, Montana has a booming economy, with ranching, mining, and lumber grounding the local economy. It is also a large tourist destination, not only for its national parks, but also the plethora of ski resorts located within the state; Big Sky and Whitefish are among the most recognisable names. Collectively, Protestants make of the largest group in Montana, but the single largest denomination in the state is Roman Catholic. Other large groups include Lutheran and Mormon. Montana has a large number of Native American reservations, which offer a wonderful and unique opportunity to learn about the different culture and customs. However, be careful to not use any politically incorrect terms or slurs, even in a joking matter; they will be taken offensively and are considered highly rude. Though not in the Midwest, the midwestern attitude carries over into Montana residents; famed for their generosity, hospitality, and courteousness, Montana residents will find you rude if you do not reciprocate their kindness.  English was declared the official state language in 1995. It is the most widely spoken and used language throughout the state. The state also has small Spanish, German, and Native American speaking populations, along with very small populations of other minority language speaking groups.",Summer temperatures average from 14.4°C to 30°C (58°F to 86°F). Seasonal extremes are greater to the east of the Continental Divide. The Great Plains are subject to waves of frigid arctic air six to 12 times each winter.

Sure, there’s a lot of prairie and farmland, but there are also buzzing cities, unique landscapes and quirky sights. State capital, Lincoln, has a student vibe, a hip and historic downtown, and flourishing arts and music scenes. You can catch big-name artists and sports stars in the shiny Pinnacle Bank Arena, tap your toes to jazz and blues in the Zoo Bar, or wander the sculpture garden of the Philip Johnson-designed Sheldon Museum of Art. Nebraska’s biggest city, Omaha, reveals its own impressive line-up.

However, control changed hands after the French lost the Seven Years’ War and the territory was given to Spain. The US gained control of the territory with the Louisiana Purchase in 1803. Shortly after, the first town in Nebraska, called Bellevue, was created by the Missouri Fur Company in 1822. In the years following, several small towns and outposts cropped up across the region. In 1854, the US Congress passed the Kansas-Nebraska Act and created the two new, separate territories. Settlers began to venture into Nebraska shortly afterwards, many of them farmers. When the Homestead Act passed in 1862 and provided land to settlers at a very low cost, even more hopeful settlers flocked to the territory. The Union Pacific Railroad (today headquartered in the state’s largest city, Omaha) reached the Nebraska Territory in the 1860s; Nebraska, now an agricultural and trading centre, was admitted to the Union as the 37th state in 1867. The Great Depression, beginning in 1929, greatly impacted Nebraska as crop prices lowered drastically and unemployment skyrocketed. The downturn was righted during WWII, when food demands increased and the state was used a centre for munitions, lessening the unemployment. In the 1980s, a farming crisis across the United States greatly affected Nebraska and many farms were forced to foreclose; however, this also allowed other industries to flourish in the state, creating a more balanced economy that was less reliant on agriculture. Today, Nebraska’s agriculture remains a vital part of the state economy. A leading producer of corn, beef, and soybeans, it plays a large part in national agriculture. Modern Nebraska, however, has a much more diversified economy. As large generators of wind and solar power, they are leaders in alternative energy and also leaders in industry; the state is home to large companies like Union Pacific Railroad, Berkshire Hathaway, and Mutual of Omaha. The largest single denomination in Nebraska is overwhelmingly Roman Catholic, making up over 20% of the religious population. Protestant groups making up the majority of the remainder, with Lutheran, Methodist, and Baptist having the largest followings. Very small groups of Jewish, Muslim and Eastern religious groups also reside in the state. As the majority of the state is rural (Nebraska is the 8th least densely populated state), outdoor recreation is a common hobby and pastime for residents and also visitors. With many state parks scattered across Nebraska, any outdoor recreation is only a short while away; hiking and camping in the parks are a favourite for residents. Residents of Nebraska, like many others in the Midwest, are traditionally considered polite, friendly, and adverse to confrontation. English is the official language and the most widely used. The state also has a fairly significant Spanish speaking population due to an influx of workers during the 1940s. Smaller populations of German, French and Vietnamese speaker also live here.",The region has the most continental climate of any area in the USA. Winters are cold and summers warm.

The world’s premier gambling hotspot, Las Vegas isn’t nicknamed ‘Sin City’ for nothing. Recklessly gamble away those dollars in one of the many super casinos on the Strip, get married on a whim, or saunter off to a strip club, safe in the knowledge that what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas. Las Vegas isn’t the only city you should visit in Nevada. Another major city to explore is Reno, affectionately known as ‘the Biggest Little City in the World’. A fascinating metropolis, it has all the gambling attractions of Vegas plus a thrilling whitewater park and quick access to a host of outdoor pursuits amid blockbuster scenery. The state capital Carson City is an authentic, small-town stopover, boasting interesting museums, unique antique shopping and an impressive Capitol Building with silver-painted cupola. Jump aboard the V&T Railroad in Virginia City for a trip back to the 1800s. And don’t miss the spectacular beauty of nearby Lake Tahoe, an expansive, glistening lake along the border with California. It’s heaven on earth for kayakers, hikers, windsurfers and swimmers, not to mention skiers, who have more than a dozen ski resorts to choose from in the winter. If you fancy hitting the highway, go on a 4,800 km (3,000 miles) journey down US Route 50, known as the 'Loneliest Road in America’, which offers one of the last opportunities to experience the Old West.

It wasn’t until the early 19th century when Spanish friar Francisco Garcés became the first European to explore the area, making his way up from New Mexico and recording the Native American tribes he encountered. By 1851 the first villages and towns were being founded by Mormons settlers on their way to work California’s gold fields. Ten years later, an Act of Congress established the Territory of Nevada, and President Abraham Lincoln appointed James W. Nye as its Territorial Governor. On October 31, 1964, President Lincoln granted Nevada statehood to the US as the 36th state. Nevada was the first state to give African American men the right to vote with the ratification of the 15th Amendment in 1869. By this time, Nevada’s economy had hit the jackpot with the discovery of the Comstock Lode in 1859, prompting a silver rush and an influx of labourers looking to mine the precious metal. By 1882 over $300 million’s worth of silver had been mined from the lode. In time Nevada’s economic stronghold became known as Las Vegas, meaning “the meadows” as named by the first European to encounter the valley in 1829. Las Vegas became connected to railroads in 1905 – bringing the city to life. During a period of gambling prohibition from 1909 to 1931, illegal speakeasies and casinos cropped up along with organised crime activity. The construction of the nearby Hoover Dam led to the appearance of casinos along Fremont Street, and by 1946 the first luxury resort was built. The 1950s marked an era of new resorts funded by crime organisations; however, by the late 1960s legitimate corporations had begun to invest in Las Vegas. Over the past few decades, Las Vegas, especially The Strip, has been revamped with massive resorts and casinos due to high tourism rates. Did you know? • The state also holds notorious ties to the Cold War as over 100 nuclear bombs were tested at the Nevada Test Site, northwest of Las Vegas. • Nevada comes from the Spanish term for snow-covered yet it is the driest state in the US and is mostly made up of desert and semi-arid regions. In Nevada, the largest denominations are Roman Catholic, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormon) and the Southern Baptist Convention. As in other states, Protestant affiliation is broken down to mainline, evangelical and other branches. In Nevada, Protestant affiliation totals 35%, while Roman Catholic is at 25%. From the 1940s to the early 2000s Nevada held the title of fastest-growing state. Because many of its residents originate from other states, especially California, Nevada has a diverse social culture. Courtesy can be shown by pronouncing Nevada as Nevadans do. Instead of the Spanish pronunciation, which is widely used outside of the state, the second syllable of Nevada rhymes with “mad.” English is the most widely spoken language in Nevada, followed by Spanish and Asian and Pacific Island languages.","Nevada is basin and range country, with about 250 mountain ranges running north-south. Base elevation ranges from 1,365m (4,500ft) to 1,880m (6,200ft); altitudes vary from over 4,000m (13,000ft) to less than 150m (492ft). The climate in Nevada is semi-arid with abundant sunshine, light rainfall and snow. Average temperatures vary from about 19°C (66°F) in Carson City in the south to 8°C (47°F) in Elko in the north. To the south, lightweights with extra covering for evenings are suggested. In the northern areas, heavier weight clothing is recommended."
north-america,canada,"Gorgeous coastline, the world’s highest tides, sensational seafood, huge chunks of wilderness and a cosmopolitan heritage: New Brunswick is a maritime gem. The province’s unmissable natural wonder is the Bay of Fundy, which separates New Brunswick from Nova Scotia. As well as whales, this vast bay boasts the world's highest tide and the best place to watch it is at Hopewell Rocks, a collection of tree-topped sea stacks that disappear before your eyes as the tide rises four stories in a matter of minutes. Away from the seaside, New Brunswick offers outdoor adventure in spades. You can camp, mountain bike and ski in the Appalachian Mountains; kayak and canoe across gentle lakes and churning rapids or hook salmon the size of small dogs on the Mirimachi River. Not surprisingly for a province more than half-wrapped in coastline, New Brunswick’s seafood is pretty special. Delve into platefuls of oyster soup, lobster stew, or anything flavoured with dulse, a type of edible seaweed. New Brunswickers love to show off their heritage; English, Scots, Irish and French have all made their mark here. You might stumble upon bagpipers giving it laldy at a Scottish Highland Games or find yourself tapping your toes to a barnstorming Irish dance performance. Middle Island Heritage Park recounts the sobering story of immigrants fleeing the potato famine who were quarantined on this island, many of whom never made it off. Nearly a third of New Brunswickers are French speakers, so dust off your dictionary and get chatting to New Brunswick’s Acadians. The Village Historique Acadien is jam-packed with costumed characters guiding you through their history, but you can have just as much fun nattering in an Acadian village bar with a glass of the local vino. 72,908 sq km (28,150 sq miles). 753,900 (2015). 10.3 per sq km.

Autumn and spring are relatively mild. Winters are cold with heavy snows. Light- to medium-weight clothing during summer months, heavy-weight clothing in winter. Waterproofing is advisable all year-round. New Brunswick, which is below the Gaspé Peninsula, shares its western border with Maine and has 2,250km (1,400 miles) of coastline. Its landscape comprises forested hills with rivers cutting through them. The main feature is the St John River Valley in the south. Northern and eastern coastal regions give way to the extensive drainage basin of the Miramichi River in the central area."
north-america,united-states-of-america,"Picturesque from top to toe, New Hampshire may be small but it punches well above its weight with spectacular scenery, cosmopolitan cities and bountiful opportunities for outdoor adventure. You can drive up the USA’s oldest manmade attraction, the Mt Washington Auto Road, pedal through covered bridges and white-clapboard villages, wear out your phone battery snapping autumn leaves, or gaze up at star-sprinkled skies. New Hampshire’s thickly forested mountains, crystalline lakes and sugary beaches are a magnet for outdoor adventurers. The long-distance Appalachian Trail snakes through the state, or you can choose from 1,900km (1,200 miles) of hiking paths in the White Mountains National Forest. Find your Zen on the water with a stand-up paddleboarding yoga class on Lake Winnipesaukee or meet rapids head-on via kayak on the Magalloway River, home to ospreys, moose and black bears. In winter, skiers and riders rip it up at Cannon Mountain or down the backcountry slopes of Tuckerman Ravine. If that’s not challenging enough pack an ice axe and claw your way up frozen rock faces. While New Hampshire’s coast may be minute, what it lacks in size it makes up for in sandy shores and gently pounding surf. Hampton Beach dishes up old-school seaside entertainment with its sweeping sands, picturesque boardwalk, weekly fireworks and summer concerts. If you’re craving a little culture, the Currier Museum of Art in Manchester shows work by the likes of Monet, Picasso and O’Keefe, and runs tours of the fabulous Frank Lloyd Wright-designed Zimmerman House. Thirsty?

Over the years the state was largely Protestant until Roman Catholics, Greek and Russian Orthodox began to settle in the late 1800s. Roman Catholics make up the greatest percentage (35%) of the religious demographic, followed by Protestant at 32%. The United Church of Christ and The United Methodist Church make up the largest number of Protestants in New Hampshire. In New Hampshire most of the population lives in the southern part of the state closer to Boston, Massachusetts. The state aligns with the social conventions of its region, New England. This region is known for being one of the least religious in the USA, where one in four residents consider themselves without a religion. English is the most common language spoken by residents, with French and Spanish making a smaller minority. New England's distinct coastal accent comes from its roots in British colonial fishing culture.","Warm and sunny from May to October, spectacular fall foliage, followed by long, cold winters with abundant snowfall from December to April.

north-america,united-states-of-america,"The famed home of fictional gangster, Tony Soprano, New Jersey might be a compact state, but it packs in bustling cities, hedonistic seaside towns and excellent beaches. Separated from NYC by the Hudson River, New Jersey’s own cities might feel like an extension the Big Apple, but they have a charm of their own. In fact, Jersey City’s creative culinary scene has wooed many visitors from the other side of the river, while Newark and Hoboken offer a gamut of cultural attractions, leafy parks and hallowed Civil War grounds. But most fun is the Jersey Shore, an irresistible stretch of coastline luring beachgoers to expansive sweeps of white sand, historic boardwalks and buzzing resorts. Atlantic City, a kind of Vegas-by-the-sea, glitters most brightly with its palatial casinos, whirring arcades and big-name shows, not to mention a full menu of watersports, as much saltwater taffy as your teeth can handle, and the state’s tallest lighthouse. For culture vultures AC also boasts modern art parks, professional ballet corps, and the Noyes Arts Garage, home to working studios, galleries and the African American Heritage Museum. Escape the city at Cape May National Wildlife Refuge, a protected area of swamps, grasslands and maritime forests frequented by hundreds of thousands of migrating birds each year. Or head further inland to Egg Harbor City, where the Renault winery has been keeping oenophiles tipsy for some 150 years, even continuing under a special permit during Prohibition (purely for medicinal purposes naturally).

Trenton.","The first known inhabitants of New Jersey were the Delaware Indians 10,000 years ago. Italian explorer, Giovanni de Verrazano, was the first to sail in New Jersey’s waters in approximately 1524. In 1609 Henry Hudson, an English explorer who sailed on behalf of the Netherlands, passed through Newark Bay. Hudson acquired the area and named it New Netherlands; the state’s early settlers came from The Netherlands, Finland and Sweden. The British took over New Netherlands in 1664 and renamed the area New Jersey after the Isle of Jersey. New Jersey was broken up into east and west regions and overseen by the proprietors, Sir George Carteret and Lord John Berkley. The two Englishmen decided to sell the land and give the colonists political and religious freedoms. However, this did not last for long as New Jersey was given a joint British governor who also oversaw New York. In 1738 New Jersey was granted its own governor. During the Revolution the majority of battles were fought in New Jersey due to its proximity to Philadelphia and New York City. The Battles of Trenton and Princeton were two important points in the Revolution for both the Americans and General George Washington. New Jersey was the first state to sign the Bill of Rights in 1787. Three years later, Trenton became its capital city. New Jersey entered the 19th century with a flourishing economy in manufacturing and factory industries such as textiles, trains and steel. A successful economy combined with the advent of canals and railways attracted European immigrants to the area. The southern region of New Jersey remained agricultural, but underwent change as railroads forged through the state. Post-Civil War New Jersey experienced an influx of immigrants from Ireland, Germany, Italy and Eastern Europe. The state suffered through the Great Depression in the 1930s, but experienced a revival in its industries during WWII. In the 1950s suburban culture emerged due to the openings of the New Jersey Turnpike and Garden State Parkway. Famous New Jersey residents include President Woodrow Wilson who also served as governor from 1910 to 1913, and Thomas Edison, inventor of the light bulb.  Roman Catholicism holds the largest religious affiliation in New Jersey, followed by Judaism. The greatest Protestant denominations include Methodist, Presbyterian and Episcopal. New Jerseyans are often associated with similar cultural stereotypes to their neighbours in New York. They are stereotyped as rude, loud and often mocked for a heavy mid-Atlantic accent. In recent years many of these perceptions derive from reality television programmes. However, New Jerseyans are known for pride in their state, generally maintaining strong connections to their hometowns and to the famous Jersey Shore where they spend their summers. English is the language most commonly spoken throughout the state of New Jersey but a large minority do speak a mixture of other languages, Spanish and Italian being predominant amongst these.","Flanked by the Atlantic Ocean and the Delaware River, New Jersey has a fairly moderate climate, with cold winters and warm, humid summers. The state's temperature ranges from a July average of 23°C (74°F) to -1°C (30°F) in January, with a more pronounced difference between north and south in the winter. Annual snowfall averages 41cm (16 inches). There is moderate rainfall throughout the year. Heavyweights with extra bundling for the winter months. Lightweights for the summer.

north-america,united-states-of-america,"Sensational sunsets, expansive deserts and wide-open plains; imposing mountain ranges, lush forests and gargantuan caverns; historic cities and a reputation for the extraterrestrial: welcome to New Mexico. Nicknamed “the land of enchantment,” the state somehow manages to live up to that lofty billing with its spectacular topography and fascinating heritage. The Pueblo and Navajo Native American cultures are very much alive and well here, and a strong Hispanic lineage also helps determine its distinctive character. New Mexico’s historic national parks include the equally overwhelming and enchanting Carlsbad Caverns (where you can watch Mexican free-tailed bats emerge at sunset), the beguiling beauty of White Sands, the awe-inspiring sight of Shiprock mountain in Navajo country, and the striking cliff dwellings and Pueblo settlements of Bandelier National Monument. The state’s largest city, Albuquerque, is a colourful metropolis made famous by the hit television series, Breaking Bad. A hip city with a vibrant arts and music scene, the city’s charming Old Town and bountiful cultural attractions, coupled with its attractive setting on the Rio Grande, make it a popular destination. Santa Fe, with its earthy adobe architecture, is the USA’s oldest state capital, known for its sophisticated artistic community. You can catch a glimpse of the oldest church in the country, procure local art and Navajo weavings at Indian markets, or merely take in the city’s pleasant ambiance. In the southeastern quarter of the state lies Roswell, a relatively unexceptional city until 1947 when a UFO reportedly crashed nearby. To this day visitors flock to this corner of New Mexico to imbibe the extraterrestrial ambiance and walk around a museum dedicated to the infamous incident. 314,914 sq km (121,589 sq miles). 2.1 million (2015). 6.6 per sq km. Santa Fe.","The land now known as New Mexico was originally occupied by members of the Clovis cultures of Paleo-Indians and Mongolian Indians, as well as American Indians. By the 16th century there were also Navajo, Ute and Apache, who had settled together. The first explorer that set out to find the land was Francisco Vazquez de Coronado. An enormous expedition was assembled at Compostela in 1540-1542 to find the magical cities of gold as described by Fray Marcos de Niza as the mystical ‘Seven gold cities of Cibola.’ It was widely believed, among explorers at the time, that New Mexico was filled with gold.  Coronado was unsuccessful in his quest to discover the land and was unable to find any gold. The name New Mexico was decided upon by Juan De Onate when he was appointed first governor of the province of New Mexico in 1598. In the same year he founded the San Juan de los Caballeros colony, the first permanent European settlement in New Mexico. Once appointed, governor Onate extended the road from his remote colony to Santa Barbra Chihuahua. This road was 1130km (700 miles) long and named El Camino de Real Tierra Adentro (The Royal Road of the Interior). From 1680 to 1692 as a result of an uprising by the Pueblo people the settlement was abandoned by the Spanish. The uprising had been led by Pueblo leader Popé and the area was restored to Spanish rule after his death. Once resettled, the Spanish settlers founded Albuquerque and set out to develop it as a trade centre. Following the Mexican war of Independence in 1820 the claims for the province of New Mexico passed to Mexico. New Mexico was separated from Texas by the Comanche and its only attempt was the failed Texas Santa Fe expedition. The extreme northeastern part of New Mexico was originally ruled by France but was sold to the United States as part of the Louisiana Purchase in 1803. The Spanish population had reached 25,000 by the 19th century but Comanche and Apache raids on Hispanic settlers in the region were common until much later. The New Mexico territory on September 9th 1850 was established to recognise the settlement of New Mexico which today includes Arizona and parts of Colorado. In the Gadsden Purchase of 1853 the US acquired the heel of southwestern Arizona below the Gila River for the construction of a transcontinental railroad. Congress admitted New Mexico as the 47th state in the union on January 6th 1912. The majority of New Mexico residents identify themselves as Roman Catholic, followed by Southern Baptist, Mormon and Methodist. Nicknamed the “Land of Enchantment,” New Mexico possesses a spiritual significance to some communities due to the beauty of its terrain. The Valley of the Shining Stone, for instance, draws in religious groups such as Roman Catholics, Muslims and Buddhists. New Mexico has the highest proportion of Hispanic population in the US at 43.6%, according the latest government census data in 2010. Thus, many social conventions in the state follow those practised in Hispanic and Spanish-speaking communities. Spanish speakers address others with formality and tend to start off a greeting with a firm handshake. It is common for some men or women to be addressed by the titles “Don” or “Dona,” signifying respect. Affection is shown in the forms of a kiss on the cheek or a hug to close family and friends. Punctuality may have less emphasis within the Hispanic community. However, it is important to attend a social gathering or event in formal attire. There is no official language for the state of New Mexico; the majority of the speakers living in the state speak Spanish, whereas the law does not permit Spanish in the legislature, and thus cannot be considered a bilingual state. However, Spanish is recognised and public education can be delivered in either Spanish or English. The main languages spoken in the region include Spanish, English and Navajo. There is also a new range of speakers who speak a new dialect of New Mexican Spanish and are believed to be decedents of Spanish colonists from the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries.","New Mexico has a mild, arid or semiarid, continental climate characterised by light precipitation, abundant sunshine and relatively large temperature ranges. During summer, temperatures often exceed 37.8°C (100°F) at elevations below 1,524m (5,000ft), but winter temperatures will often dip down to freezing. The highest mountains (over 4,000m/13,000ft) have climate characteristics common to the Rocky Mountains and ski areas maintain good bases from late November into mid April. The state has an average elevation of about 1,433m (4,700ft) above sea level. Covers a wide gamut. Warm winter clothes are required in cold snowy areas, while cool summer cotton is preferred for warmer climes. Check for weather details before visiting a section of the state."
north-america,united-states-of-america,"Buzzing NYC is one of the highlights of New York State, but beyond this mega city lie fine beaches, forested mountains, pretty towns and bountiful historical attractions. A short hop east from Manhattan, Long Island is a popular weekend escape for sweltering New York City dwellers. You can join the likes of J-Lo and Steven Spielberg by snagging yourself a posh summer home in the Hamptons or, more realistically, pitch a tent amongst windswept ocean dunes. Flowing through the Hudson Valley north of NYC is the scenic Hudson River, which inspired a mid-19th century art movement. Today many artistic communities remain, perched atop dramatic cliffs overlooking the river. Further north are the Catskill and Adirondack mountain ranges, a magnet for adrenaline junkies, who come to hike, bike, camp, fish and ski. Nearby Adirondack Park is the largest publicly protected area in the USA, and teems with boreal forests, rocky peaks and pristine waterways. It's absolutely stunning, particularly in autumn. To the west, the Finger Lakes region boasts lakes, woodlands and campsites aplenty. Not to mention the historic Erie Canal, Lake Ontario and more than 1,000 waterfalls. This is the state’s prime wine-producing region, with ample opportunities to imbibe at local vineyards. Nearby Chautauqua-Allegheny offer more outdoor activities, plus the opportunity to visit Amish communities, Native American reservations and wineries.

Albany.","New York has a fascinating history, not least because it was once the capital of the USA. Before that, however, Native American tribes called the region home. The area was colonised early on, when Henry Hudson claimed New York for the Dutch in 1609. In 1624 the Dutch established lower New York State as New Netherlands. They traded actively with the Native Americans throughout the 17th century and ruled the colony, then called “New Netherland” until 1664, when it was conquered by the British who then took over the area and named it New York after the Duke of York. Just over a century later, in 1776, New York declared its independence, making it one of the original 13 states of the union. New York has played a central role in much of the nation's history. It was the site of the first major battle of the Revolutionary War and at least one-third of that war's battles were fought here. It was the birthplace or home of many of the fathers of the new nation; it was a centre for debate and activism related to the abolition and suffrage movements; and it was the primary port of call for immigrants arriving to the US in the 19th century and beyond. New York is often associated with the Statue of Liberty, which was gifted from France to the USA and erected in the New York Harbour in 1886. During this time millions of European immigrants entered New York’s waters and the statue became an American symbol of freedom. In this age of immigration, New York City in particular became a multicultural hub and the standout example of the US's “melting pot” demographics. New York City has also been significant in global history. Many trends –political, financial, and cultural – are born in New York, and its position as a world centre of commerce remains unshaken by the horrific 2001 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center which killed nearly 3,000. Today, construction of the Freedom Tower, a memorial to victims of the attack, is underway. Catholics represent 40% of New York's population, while 30% of New Yorkers identify as Protestant. Smaller Jewish and Muslim minorities comprise 8.5 and 3.5% of the population, respectively. Approximately 13% of New Yorkers say they have no religious affiliation. While visitors' perceptions of New York State may be that of a liberal state, keep in mind that that perception is shaped primarily by and about New York City. It is often forgotten that there is more to New York State than the New York metropolitan area, where because of their heavy accents and fast-paced lifestyle downstate New Yorkers are prone to being stereotyped as abrasive, loud and snobbish. Though they are not an insignificant part of the state's population (indeed, they number more than 8 million of the state's 19.5 million residents), they are also not representative of the larger norm. Practices, behaviours, and forms of dress and speech that are perfectly acceptable in New York City may be considered inappropriate in other parts of the state. Outside of New York City, it is generally considered impolite to discuss religious or political beliefs among acquaintances. People meeting for the first time typically shake hands rather than kiss or embrace. Outside of the city New Yorkers are known for their friendliness. From downstate to upstate, New York has a very diverse population. Because of the myriad cultures and religions New York possesses an eclectic mix of social conventions, but while cultural diversity is visible in other parts of the state, it is not as evident as in New York City. The official language of New York is English. Many New Yorkers, particularly in New York City, may speak another language (or languages) as a primary or acquired language. Spanish is the second most-prevalent language spoken in the state, though Mandarin Chinese is rapidly increasing. More than 140 languages are spoken in New York City, where 46% of the population speaks a language other than English at home.","New York is warm and sunny from May to October, followed by cold winters. Snow is common in the mountains and interior part of the state. Buffalo gets more snow than Anchorage, Alaska due to the lake effect from Lake Erie. Summer in New York City can be hot and humid, with occasional tropical storms. Due to vehicular emissions, the city often issues ozone alert days during summer months. Fall is a popular time to visit New York, as the leaves on trees turn brilliant shades of red, yellow and orange, and temperatures tend to be very comfortable. “Leaf peeping” is a popular autumn activity among locals and visitors alike. Winters are usually cold, with occasional snowstorms, freezing rain and bitter cold winds, which blow off both the Hudson and the East Rivers. The winter conditions outside the city often mean liberal snow for skiers. Due to variable weather conditions, visitors should pack clothing that allows for layering. Lightweight cottons and linens are advised for summer months, while heavyweight clothing with extra bundling are advised for the winter. Visitors planning on engaging in outdoor activities, regardless of the time of year, should be sure to pack relevant specialty clothing. Keep in mind that the water in the Atlantic Ocean never gets particularly warm, so those planning on surfing at popular points such as Montauk should plan on wearing a full wet suit. New York State may not be among the largest states in the US, but it is geographically diverse, with mountains, forests, valleys, lakes, and oceans creating diverse landscapes and microclimates. Though many visitors' perceptions of New York may be of a bustling, vibrant hyper-urban tableau, the majority of the state is actually quite pastoral, and both residents and politicians tend to support land preservation initiatives. New York State borders six other states, one country (Canada), and two of the nation's Great Lakes, as well as the Atlantic Ocean. Recently, concerns have arisen about modern geological activity, especially seismic activity. A 2011 earthquake felt in New York caused residents to become more interested in learning about the state's fault lines, and concerns about climate change have precipitated conversations about flood zones and long-term infrastructure planning, especially in New York City. The state features several mountain ranges, including the Catskills and the Adirondacks, whose geographical attributes are largely responsible for attracting so many visitors who love the outdoors. Though rivers are an important feature of the state's geography, particularly in New York, which is hemmed in by the Hudson River on its west side and the East River on its east side, the state is perhaps even better known for its lakes, the number of which have given rise to the name of an entire region: the Thousand Lakes. Of course, there is also the Atlantic Ocean, which is certainly one of the main attractions for visitors to Long Island. The area now known as New York state was once glacial, which is why modern visitors can enjoy Niagara Falls, the result of glacial melt."
north-america,canada,"“Newfies” bear the brunt of many a Canadian joke, but they’re having the last laugh: raw natural beauty, charming little villages and welcoming locals should push Newfoundland and Labrador towards the front of your to-visit list. Pretty wooden houses painted the colours of the rainbow cling to cliffsides and 10,000-year-old icebergs the size of castles drift past their front doors. Humpback, minke and blue whales (to name a few) dance offshore and half a million puffins nest in the rocks – count them if you don’t believe us. Newfoundland and Labrador is almost three times the size of New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island combined, and is blessed with 29,000km (18,125 miles) of craggy coastline. The province is filled with historic towns and landmarks documenting the region's indiginous aboriginal inhabitants, Viking visitors and maritime heritage. Water Street on St John’s claims to be the oldest street in North America. And it is strange to think that you are actually closer here to Ireland's Cape Clear than to Ontario's Thunder Bay (though not so odd when you hear the local dialect – grab a copy of the Dictionary of Newfoundland English if you get stuck). Newfoundland and Labrador is also a place of ancient landscapes, such as the unique and beautiful geological features of the UNESCO-listed Gros Morne National Park, or the colossal mountain ranges of the Torngat, Kaumajet and Kiglapait and their primeval exposed rock. Many of the province’s indigenous people (the First Nations, Métis and Innu) still reside here, often in isolated communities. And the European descendants are fiercely proud of their roots, so if an Atlantic storm hits, dive into the nearest pub and enjoy an all-day knees-up, with fiddlers and accordion players cranking out Celtic-inspired tunes. 405,212 sq km (156,453 sq miles). 527,800 (2015). 1.3 per sq km.

Aboriginal peoples with distinct cultures and traditions include the Mi'kmaq on Newfoundland and the Inuit, Innu and Métis in Labrador. Geographical isolation nurtured a fiercely independent spirit in the province, which did not join Canada until 1949. Although Canada is officially bilingual (English and French), 95% of this province speaks English as a first language.","Winters are very cold and temperatures rarely rise above freezing, making Newfoundland And Labrador perfect for winter sports enthusiasts. Summers are mild. Light- to medium-weight clothing in the warmer months, heavy-weight clothing and winter boots in winter. Waterproofing is advisable throughout the year. Newfoundland and Labrador is the most easterly Canadian province. It consists of the island of Newfoundland and the mainland region of Labrador, which borders the province of Québec. The province has around 29,000km (18,125 miles) of coastline, much of it rugged and heavily indented with bays and fjords. The interior of Newfoundland is a combination of forest, heath, lakes and rivers spread over a rocky terrain that ranges from low mountains in the west to rolling hills in the centre and east. Labrador is also mountainous in several areas, although its rivers are larger and wilder."
north-america,nicaragua,"Fabled land of lakes and volcanoes, Nicaragua also lays claim to vibrant colonial cities, deserted beaches and wildlife-rich rainforests. Its vibrancy is all-encompassing, and the hospitality of its people is renowned throughout the Americas. The largest country in Central America, Nicaragua is also one of the safest and cheapest countries that constitute the ‘gringo trail'. That visitor numbers to this sun-drenched sanctuary are only increasing should come as no surprise. What Nicaragua lacks in standout cultural attractions it compensates for with natural beauty. Its reefs and rainforests are hotbeds of biodiversity and teem with jaguars, monkeys and myriad bird species (though how this idyll will look after the Nicaragua Grand Canal has been built remains to be seen). The country’s wild landscapes are fertile ground for thrill-seekers. Visitors can go hiking, biking, kayaking and swimming in the country’s iconic crater lakes. Whether you want to ride some of the world’s best waves, speed along zip-lines above the jungle or scuba dive along shelves of iridescent coral, Nicaragua has it all. Sound too much like hard work? Then kick back on the twin peaks of Ometepe Island, overlooking the shimmering Lake Nicaragua, or catch a boat into the Indío Maiz Biological Reserve, the largest area of virgin rainforest north of the Amazon. Those hankering for the city life should head to León or Granada, two of Central America’s prettiest colonial cities. Both are hubs for travellers and represent gateways to nearby attractions. From León, you can climb the Maribios volcanic chain, go ‘volcano-boarding’ down the slopes of the still-rumbling Cerro Negro or pick coffee beans in the temperate northern highlands. Granada, meanwhile, is the ideal base to explore Masaya’s volcanic park, in particular, Volcano Acatenango, or zip-line over Mombacho’s cloud forest and take a cooling swim in Laguna de Apoyo. For surfers, head to San Juan del Sur in search of the perfect wave, then spend your evenings dancing the night away in the city - made famous for its nightlife and the renowned ‘Sunday Funday’ festival. Others can abscond to the Corn Islands, an archipelago that offers everything you'd expect from the Caribbean, minus the sky-high prices.

Originally, the country was occupied by migrating ethnic groups from Central and South America before Christopher Columbus invaded and explored the eastern coast in 1502. Arriving in 1522 and first led by Gil González Dávila, the Spanish then took control and stayed for around 300 years, enslaving the indigenous population, building the cities of Granada and León and fending off attacks from Dutch, French and British pirates. Conflict in Europe gradually weakened Spain’s hold over the New World and Nicaragua finally became independent in September 1821, becoming a fully independent republic in 1838. In 1909, the United States began to exert its power over the fledgling nation, opening military bases over the coming years to steer an election in its favour. But Augusto Sandino – who later gave his name to the Sandinistas – launched a guerrilla campaign that forced them out by 1933. However, a new internal power stood in their way: the paramilitary National Guard led by General Anastasio Somoza García. In 1934, he ordered the arrest and execution of Sandino and his senior commanders. Two years later he became president and established a brutal and corrupt dictatorship that lasted for almost half a century. When Somoza García was assassinated in 1956, his sons Luis and Anastasio took over. In the early 1960s, the Marxist Frente Sandinista de Liberación Nacional (FSLN), or Sandinistas, formed but soon disbanded. A turning point came in 1972, when an earthquake in Managua killed around 10,000 people and left over 250,000 homeless. The government siphoned off much of the international relief money and opposition to them began to grow amongst all social classes. The Sandinistas regrouped and, after a short but bloody conflict, the government was overturned in 1979. They then began a programme of agrarian reform that gave land back to those living in poverty, nationalised industry and set up health and literacy programmes. But peace was short-lived. In 1981, the United States set about toppling the Sandinistas, with Ronald Reagan’s anti-communist campaign funding the Contra guerrilla forces. The Sandinistas lost popularity during the Contra war, but Daniel Ortega survived as leader and, after losing the 1990, 1996 and 2001 elections, he was re-elected in 2006 and, controversially, again in 2011 and is still in power today. Did you know? •	Nicaraguans sometimes call themselves “pinoleros”, after the soft drink, pinol, which is popular throughout the country. •	Gil González Dávila named Nicaragua after a local native chief, Nicarao. •	US president Franklin D. Roosevelt once said of ruthless dictator Anastasio Somoza: “He may be a son of a bitch, but he’s our son of a bitch.” 73% Roman Catholic; 15% Evangelical; 12% other. Nicaraguans greet each other with a handshake, or for someone you know well, a kiss on the cheek and a hug. Casual dress is fine in most situations, although some formality will be expected in business situations. Punctuality is not a strong suit of Nicaragua, and it’s not unusual for people to turn up 20-40 minutes late for a meeting, usually due to the nature of travel and traffic here. If invited to someone’s home, it is customary and polite to give the host a small gift. If offered something to eat, try to accept or at least try it; refusal may cause some offence. Whilst travelling around Nicaragua, be prepared to be stared at, especially if visiting more rural areas – this is more out of curiosity than anything else. The same goes for conversations; while you may get a few very blunt questions, it is generally not out of rudeness. Photography: Avoid photographing military sites or personnel. Spanish is the official language. Along the Mosquito Coast (Costa de Mosquito), there are communities that speak an English-based creole language in which African or mixed African and indigenous peoples predominate.","The climate in Nicaragua differs according to region, so the best time to go varies. The climate is tropical for almost the entire country and is therefore hot all year round, with temperatures averaging approximately 27ºC (81ºF) all year. In lower lying areas temperatures can range from 22ºC (72ºF) to 30ºC (86ºF), whilst in the mountains it is typically cooler; hovering between 12ºC (53ºF) and 20ºC (68ºF). Most tourists visit Nicaragua during the dry season, which runs from December to May. The rainy season generally lasts from June to November, however nearer to the Pacific it runs from May to November. The climate on the Atlantic northwestern side of Nicaragua can be very temperamental and receives the highest volume of rainfall in the country on average. Granada The temperature in Granada varies little throughout the year, with the average high a balmy 32ºC (90ºF) and the average low a temperate 23ºC (74ºF). The best time to visit is in the dry season from early December to late March, when there is enough wind and breeze to cool the abrasive tropical heat. León Like much of Nicaragua, León is hot year round, and generally fluctuates between highs of 34ºC (94ºF) and lows of 23ºC (74ºF). Visiting León can be done year-round, however it’s recommended to visit during peak tourist season, particularly towards the start of the New Year. With high levels of humidity, as is typical of tropical Nicaragua, you’ll want to pack summer clothing and waterproofs too. San Juan del Sur A paradise for surfers and sunbathers, San Juan is perhaps where you’ll find Nicaragua at its most clement. With easy access to a number of beaches, the breeze here mitigates the searing heat of Nicaragua like no other, meaning you’ll be comfortable year-round. Managua The most built up of Nicaragua’s main cities, the capital experiences searing heat and humidity during the dry season and an abundance of tropical rain and grey skies during the wet season. With less trees and natural resources around in this metropolis, it’s harder to escape the full force of the elements, so planning accordingly is advised. The peak tourist season in Nicaragua is between December and March, so anyone wanting to avoid the crowds should consider travelling during the shoulder season months of May and November. Lightweight cottons and linens are required throughout the year – bring shorts, t-shirts, and beach wear if you’ll be visiting coastal regions. Waterproofs are advisable during the rainy season. Warmer clothes are recommended when visiting the northern mountains; think woolly knits and layers that allow you to wrap up warm as the temperature drops. Nicaragua is the largest country in Central America, bordering Honduras to the north and Costa Rica to the south. To the east lies the Caribbean, and to the west the Pacific. In the north are the Isabella Mountains, while the country's main feature in the southwest is Lake Nicaragua which is about 160km (99 miles) long and about 72km (44 miles) at its widest. The island of Ometepe is the largest of the hundreds of islands on the lake. These islands have a reputation for great beauty and are one of the country's main tourist attractions. Lake Managua is situated northwest of Lake Nicaragua. Volcanoes, including the famous Momotombo, protrude from the surrounding lowlands northwest of the lakes. The country's main rivers are the San Juan, the lower reaches of which form the border with Costa Rica, and the Rio Grande de Matagalpa. The Corn Islands (Islas del Maiz) in the Caribbean are two small beautiful islands fringed with white coral and palms. They are very popular as holiday resorts with both Nicaraguans and tourists."

White sand and surf lure sun worshipers and adrenaline junkies to the state’s 480km (300 miles) of barrier island beaches; surfers paddle out to ride the renowned swell at Cape Hatteras; hang-gliders launch off dunes the size of small mountains at Jockey’s Ridge; and wild horses roam the beach at Corolla in the Outer Banks. If flopping on the sand doesn’t do it for you, try North Carolina’s historic attractions. Think Europe has the stately home market tied up? Think again. Built in the late 1800s, Biltmore House is the USA’s largest home and is reminiscent of a French château. Or you can head underground at Reed Gold Mine, site of the country’s first documented gold discovery. The state’s oldest town is Bath, but you’re more likely to find traces of Blackbeard here than Jane Austen. Come autumn, convoys of sightseers cruise the Blue Ridge Parkway, a 406km (252-mile) scenic drive through mountains and dense forests, to snap the state’s kaleidoscopic colours.  But North Carolina’s pièce de résistance is its world-class ice climbing. While you can stand and gaze at plummeting waterfalls in summer, hacking your way up them with crampons and an ice axe is a sure-fire way to crank up the adrenaline. Starshine, a 60m (200ft) route on Whitesides Mountain, is considered one of the gnarliest. Looking for some city action? Famed for its NASCAR racing, Charlotte is also home to the US National Whitewater Center and the outstanding Blumenthal Performing Arts Center.

Following an expedition led by Juan Pardo, Spanish explorers arrived in North Carolina in the 1560s forming a settlement around Fort San Juan. San Juan along with five other forts were destroyed in an attack by the native population about a year later. All but one of Pardo’s men survived. Bestowed a charter from Elizabeth I, Sir Walter Raleigh made ground in North Carolina, at the time called Virginia, in 1584, in the hope of starting an English settlement. However, his two colonies failed. What happened to the “Lost Colony” of Roanoke Island remains a mystery. English settlers in Virginia started to venture south to North Carolina in the 1650s. In 1710 Carolina was divided into North and South. By 1729 the Crown officially pronounced North Carolina a royal colony. Northerners began to migrate to North Carolina as the slave population increased on the tobacco and rice plantations.  In 1776, North Carolinian politicians signed the Halifax Resolve, the first step in the call for the Colonies’ independence from Britain. A new constitution was drafted later that year and in 1787, despite resentment from some sides, North Carolina was the 12th state to ratify the US Constitution. Railroad tracks were set in place between the coastal city of Wilmington and Raleigh, the state capital, in 1836. Despite its railway infrastructure, North Carolina remained overwhelmingly agricultural. In 1860 one-third of the state’s population were African American slaves. At first, North Carolina was apprehensive in seceding from the Union, but after the attack on Fort Sumter in 1861 it joined the Confederacy in the Civil War. North Carolina provided the largest contingent of troops to the Confederacy, numbering 125,000. In 1899 a new state constitution severely limited blacks and poor North Carolinians from voting by establishing poll taxes and literacy tests. Soon racial segregation was instituted through Jim Crow laws. North Carolina’s farmers were hit hard during the Great Depression of the 1930s, with the New Deal and other federal relief programmes proving vital for revival. Such economic boost was seen during WWII when North Carolina became the largest supplier of textiles to the war effort. In the 1930s activism again racial segregation gained momentum within the North Carolinian black community. By 1960 about 25% of the state’s population were black. That year black college students in Greensboro started the first sit-in at Woolworth’s lunch counter, inspiring more sit-ins throughout the South. Desegregation of public facilities was then established. The Federal Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Voting Rights Act of 1965 rang in a new era in North Carolina and across the once-segregated South. Protestant Christianity is the majority religion in North Carolina with the Church of the Southern Baptist Convention as the largest denomination followed by the United Methodist Church and the Presbyterian Church. There is a significant minority of Roman Catholicism followed by Judaism and Islam. North Carolinians are known for their Southern Hospitality by being accommodating and courteous to visitors. English is the main language spoken within the state, but there is a small minority of Spanish and French speakers.","North Carolina has a humid, sub-tropical climate, with short, mild winters and sultry summers. Heavy rainfall is experienced in the mountains and Mt Mitchell receives an average winter snowfall of 127cm (50 inches). The coastal areas have a more moderate climate, but are susceptible to storms and hurricanes moving up the Atlantic coast. Lightweight cotton clothes and rainwear. Warm clothing for evenings in the spring and autumn, during the winter season and in mountain areas."
north-america,united-states-of-america,"Badlands and bison, offbeat cities and spectacular scenery, Old West tales and Native American heritage: North Dakota inspires adventure. Humongous elk, furry bison, wild horses, poisonous rattlesnakes and packs of coyotes are among the assorted inhabitants of the state’s crown jewel, Theodore Roosevelt National Park. This remarkable badlands landscape is made up of three distinct areas, accessible by scenic roads, but more fun to discover on foot, horseback or canoe. You can encounter petrified forests, wind-carved canyons and prairie dog towns, or float through remote wilderness on the Little Missouri River. The adventures don’t stop there. Lake Sakakawea is ripe for messing about on boats, while Devils Lake is one of the finest spots to hook walleye, northern pike and crappie. Bumping over badlands and prairies, the 225km (140mile) Maah Daah Hey Trail is a mountain biker’s paradise. And if you’re looking for hardcore action, there’s the so-called ENDracing phenomenon, a series of endurance tests ranging from a winter triathlon to a 58km (36mile) river swim. North Dakota may not be the first place you think of when it comes to teeing off, but it claims more golf courses per capita than any other state (not such an impressive record given its sparse population). You can follow in the footsteps of 19th century explorers Lewis and Clark on a golf trail named in their honour, although whether the two pioneers bothered to pack their clubs is questionable. Grab an urban hit in Fargo, home to the terrific Plains Art Museum, or discover dinosaurs, a homestead shack and a 1950s soda shop at the North Dakota Heritage Center in Bismarck. 183,110 sq km (70,699 sq miles). 756,927 (2015). 4.1 per sq km.

These early inhabitants hunted mammoths and bison in the North Dakotan plains, and lived along rivers and in woodlands. The Mandan tribe was especially developed in trade and agriculture. In 1682 North Dakota and the land surrounding the Mississippi River were claimed by LaSalle for France. La Vérendrye was the first European to encounter North Dakota and the Mandan people in 1738. More European expeditions to the area, trade with the Mandans and fur posts began to emerge in the years that followed. In 1803 North Dakota became a US Territory when France sold the land to the USA in the Louisiana Purchase. North Dakota was part of the Minnesota and Nebraska Territories until 1861 when it became the Dakota Territory, including South Dakota. 28 years later the land was divided into two separate states. Homestead initiatives in North Dakota were attractive to Americans looking to move west in the 19th century. Many of these migrants were German Americans and Scandinavian Americans. The construction of railroads also increased migration to the once sparsely populated state. From 1878 to 1884 there was a surge of immigration to North Dakota’s Red River Valley because of the railroads and commercial “bonanza” farming. North Dakota is the birthplace of the Nonpartisan League, a political group that emerged from the Republican Party in 1915. The NPL was run by farmers and based its economic platform on agrarianism and state-control. The NPL gained momentum throughout the Midwest and took over North Dakota’s state offices in just one year. In the 1950s the NPL merged with the state Democratic Party. Drought followed by dust and wind storms hit North Dakota and the Midwest in 1929, lasting through the Great Depression in the 1930s, but with the revival of farmland and wheat crops which occurred during WWII agriculture became, and still is, North Dakota’s industry leader employing 24 % of the population, with its  economy thriving on flaxseed and canola production. The majority of North Dakotans are Protestant with the greatest affiliations to the Evangelical Lutheran Church and the United Methodist Church. Roman Catholic followed by Muslim and Jewish minorities make up the rest of North Dakota’s religiously affiliated population. North Dakota has the most churches per capita in the USA. North Dakotan culture is rooted in influences from Native Americans, Germans and Scandinavians. As with the rest of rural Midwestern USA, North Dakotans are known for sincerity and friendliness. English is the main language spoken throughout North Dakota but the state retains a small minority of residents whose first language is German.","Winters can be bitterly cold, with adequate snow for winter sports. Summers are warm, with enough rainfall for crop growth, and are conducive to summer sports. Temperatures average -14°C (7°F) in January to 21°C (69°F) in July.

north-america,canada,"You’re more likely to spot a herd of bison or come across a grizzly bear than you are to encounter humans in the Northwest Territories. Everything is extreme here, from the isolation (it’s very remote) to the daylight (or lack of it) and the size of the wildlife (humongous). Yellowknife, where most of the territories’ population and commercial activity is based, may not be much to write home about, but it’s the perfect launch pad for outdoor adventure. Arrive in winter, and catch a glimpse of the Northern Lights. Watch the celestial spectacle from a luxury lodge or hunker down in a cosy teepee. Witness a 3,000-strong herd of reindeer cross the frozen Mackenzie River, and celebrate the end of winter with harpoon-throwing contests, dog sledding and skidoo races at Inuvik’s Muskrat Jamboree. In the summer pay a visit to endangered whooping cranes at Wood Buffalo National Park and take a sightseeing flight over the park’s rare salt plains and free-roaming bison herds. Further north, the territories extend far beyond the Arctic Circle, well into polar bear territory. Don't forget to look up: the skies here contain some of the rarest bird species on the planet. Road trips in the Northwest Territories are no Sunday afternoon drive. The Dempster Highway runs 454 miles (730km) from Dawson City, Yukon to Inuvik, and is open year-round come rain, shine, ice or snow. The territories’ outdoor activities are many and varied. Anglers can hook lake trout that weigh more than their children. Kayakers can bounce through the Class IV Cassette Rapids on Slave River. Hikers can hit the remote Canol Heritage Trail through the Mackenzie Mountains. And the world’s leading mountaineers can tackle Nahanni National Park’s Cirque of the Unclimbables.

In smaller communities, you may hear any of a variety of native languages.","The Northwest Territories' climate is cold but relatively dry, with temperate, sunny summers, in which temperatures rarely rise above 25°C (77°F), and long, bitter winters, during which the thermometer can plunge to -40°C (-40°F), especially north of the Arctic Circle. Winter weather requires down-filled and other polar-temperature gear. Special clothing is required for adventure expeditions. Good-quality windproof and waterproof clothes, warm jerseys, gloves and moulded-sole shoes are needed at all times of the year. In the summer, thinner clothes suffice, although the temperature can drop quickly so you should wear layers. A mosquito net and repellent are essential in some areas during July and August. The Northwest Territories stretch from the Mackenzie Mountains on the Yukon border to the open, barren lands to the east, and from the shores and islands of the Arctic Ocean to the woodlands in the south. Canada's longest river, the Mackenzie, flows 4,241km (2,635 miles) from the Finlay River in British Columbia to its delta on the Beaufort Sea."

Mellow coves, sandy beaches and fossil-rich cliffs punctuate the 7,400km (4,600-mile) seashore. You can catch back-flipping humpback whales riding the waves or launch a kayak and weave among gambolling seals and porpoises. Equally thrilling is a bumpy raft ride on the tidal bore at the Bay of Fundy, home to the world’s highest tides, where 160 billion tonnes of water barrel in and out twice a day. Sampling some of the delicious sea produce is a must, whether pan-fried scallops in Digby or fresh-from-the-ocean lobster at Hall’s Harbour Pound. For the ultimate road trip, cruise the 300km (186-mile) Cabot Trail around Cape Breton Island, where gorgeous beaches and dreamy highlands lure you out of your car. In fact, why not take your time and do the whole thing by bike? There are no prizes for guessing which nation Nova Scotia takes its name from. If your Latin has failed you, the ubiquity of kilts, energetic Highland dancers and boot-stomping fiddle bands might give it away. Not to mention the province’s very own Gaelic college. It’s not just the Scots who’ve made this their home though. Early French settlers left their mark too, and you can practise your français in pretty Acadian villages in the southwest of the province.

You’re more likely to see a plodding polar bear or a bouncing beluga whale than another human being. Canada’s youngest territory makes up a fifth of Canada, but is home to less than 0.1% of its population. You have to be pretty determined to get here though, as there are no roads either to Nunavut or between the territory’s communities. A platinum credit card and a wealthy benefactor can go a long way to funding the eye-wateringly expensive airfares. But make it here and you’re rewarded with unfathomable wilderness and not a coach tour in sight. You can hike or ski among granite peaks, gigantic glaciers and mammoth fjords on Baffin Island. Or dodge herds of muskoxen and packs of Arctic wolves on Ellesmere Island, where a smattering of hardy flora makes a colourful splash on the otherwise barren scenery. Pitch your tent on the open tundra beneath a sun that never sets or brave Nunavut’s frigid temperatures and spend a night in a winter igloo. At the floe edge or sinaaq, a veritable Noah’s ark of Arctic wildlife gathers in the spring: polar bears, walruses, narwhals and beluga whales for starters. The northeastern coastline of Baffin Island is considered one of the world’s best places to spot a steady conveyor belt of 10,000-year-old icebergs drifting past.

Summers are milder, but the temperature can drop suddenly.Conditions in all parts of the territory can become hazardous when there is a combination of a low temperature and a strong wind. You should follow local advice concerning weather conditions very carefully. Nevertheless, the summer months are suitable for a wide range of activities. Winter weather requires down-filled and other polar-temperature gear. Special clothing is required for adventure expeditions. Good-quality windproof and waterproof clothes, warm jerseys, gloves and moulded sole shoes are needed at all times of the year. In the summer, thinner clothes are required but layers should be worn in case of sudden weather changes. Sunglasses and protective lotion are strongly advised. A mosquito net and repellent are essential in some areas during July and August. Nunavut covers one-fifth of Canada, stretching from Ellesmere Island off Greenland's north coast to a border that runs north from the Saskatchewan/Manitoba border and then angles west to the Arctic coast near Amundsen Gulf. The mainland portion of the territory is an almost untouched wilderness, where the stark northern tundra changes into cliffs and plateaux along the Northwest Passage. To the north and east, the Arctic Islands are surrounded by pack ice for most of the year and the region extends to the glaciers, jagged mountains and fjords of the eastern shores of Baffin and Ellesmere Islands."

The Adenas emerged in present-day Ohio around 800 BCE and many of the ceremonial mounds that they built still exist and can be visited today. In the 1700s French fur traders arrived in Ohio, building forts to facilitate trade routes linking Canada with the settlements along the Mississippi River. Towards the middle of the century, British and French fur traders became rivals in the area, sparking the Seven Years War (also known as The French and Indian War) in 1754. George Washington led troops through battles against the French in the Ohio Country and despite losing several key battles, the British won the war and the Treaty of Paris in 1763 established that the Ohio Country would be annexed to Britain. Britain’s victory was short-lived: in 1775 the American Revolutionary War began, ending in Britain’s loss of the American colonies to the new United States. Ohio became recognised as part of the Northwest Territory, and was granted statehood on 01 March 1803. Industrial activity in Ohio began at the onset of the 19th century with the Hopewell Furnace, one of the state’s first iron plants. Southern Ohio became a hotbed of blast furnaces whilst the discovery of coal introduced a prosperous steel industry. By the 1850s Ohio was ranked third in the USA for iron and steel production, moving up to second position by 1892. The state further cemented its economic success with the Ohio Oil Rush, which led to the creation of 86 oil refineries by 1884, and produced the world’s first billionaire, John D. Rockefeller, founder of Standard Oil in Cleveland. Other well-known companies founded in Ohio include the Dow Chemical Company, Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company, and Procter and Gamble. Ohio bears the nickname the “Mother of Modern Presidents” because it was home to seven American Presidents – Ulysses S. Grant, Rutherford B. Hayes, James Garfield, Benjamin Harrison, William McKinley, William H. Taft and Warren G. Harding. The leading religious groups in Ohio are Evangelical Protestant, Mainline Protestant and Roman Catholic. Minority groups include Jews, Jehovah’s Witnesses, and Muslims. Ohioan culture has been influenced by German American migrants who started to settle in the state in the mid-1800s. They brought a Midland dialect to Ohio, which originated in Pennsylvania and is still spoken today. Ohio is often referenced as the epitome of American suburban culture. Ohioans are known as courteous and polite people.

Some 60 Native American tribes have lived in ‘The Sooner State’ and visitors can wander among prehistoric mounds at Spiro, experience early Cherokee life at Tahlequah's replica villages and hit Oklahoma City for the Red Earth Festival, an energetic extravaganza of Native American artists from across the continent. There are few better states in which to giddy up for an authentic cowboy experience than Okie. Kit yourself out in clothing at Langston’s in Oklahoma City, which has been dressing cowboys and gals since 1913. Then take your pick of cattle-wrangling on a ranch, cheering on bronc riders at a rodeo, chowing down on belt-busting hunks of steak, or stomping your boots to country music at Cain’s Ballroom in Tulsa. Oklahoma lays claim to the longest driveable stretch of Route 66, which is littered with quirky roadside attractions. Snap pics of the iconic neon sign hanging outside Clinton’s Route 66 Museum and dive into POPS, a landmark diner in Arcadia, which serves classic road trip fare and a heroic selection of sodas.

In 1819, portions of the American West, including the Oklahoma Panhandle (the westernmost region), were given to the Spanish in exchange for Florida. From 1836 to 1845 the Republic of Texas was its own country after the Texas Revolution with Mexico, but when Texas entered statehood in 1845 it ceded land which included parts of present-day Oklahoma. To the west, the Oklahoma Panhandle became a “no-man’s land” as it did not fall within the provisions of a free state. Native American nations east of the Mississippi River relocated to what is now known as Indian Territory. This was a result of President Andrew Jackson’s Indian Removal Act of 1830. The famous “Trail of Tears” is associated with the Choctaw nation, the first out of five Native American groups forced to move onto the territory. During the Civil War the major tribes on Indian Territory formed alliances with the Confederacy. In the battle at Honey Springs, Union troops along with a minority of pro-Union Native Americans successfully invaded the territory, forcing many pro-Confederate Native Americans to seek refuge in the south. Cherokee Confederate General, Stand Watie, was the last to surrender in 1865. In 1887 the Dawes Act was passed allowing the USA government to enter negotiations with the Native American nations to divide the territory for settlements. Three years later the Oklahoma Organic Act was passed ensuring the area as a USA territory on its way to statehood. In 1902 the leaders of the five nations in the Indian Territory, created the Sequoyah Constitutional Convention, an attempt at securing statehood. Although ultimately unsuccessful, most of the convention’s constitution was used in a later petition for the entire area to become the state of Oklahoma. Five years after the Convention’s formation, Oklahoma became the 46th state in the USA. During the 1930s, Oklahoma became subject to drought and combined with poor farming practices, and huge storms blowing away soil, the resulting conditions (known as the Dust Bowl) crippled the state’s agriculture, forcing many farmers to become migrant workers. This experience is immortalised in John Steinbeck’s The Grapes of Wrath. By the mid-20th century, Oklahoma had recovered from the trials of the Depression and Dust Bowl conditions, and industry was on the up, particularly in the sectors of oil and gas, and agriculture. In 1995 Oklahoma made the news worldwide when a Gulf War veteran carried out the Oklahoma City Bombing that killed 168 people. Evangelical Protestants, especially the Southern Baptist Convention, are the majority in Oklahoma. Other groups include the Assemblies of God and the Churches of Christ. Roman Catholic, Muslim and Jewish denominations are small, but also present in Oklahoma. Most Oklahomans come from Native American, English, Scotch-Irish and German backgrounds, and so the state has an array of languages – many of which are considered endangered. Oklahoma has been recognised for its generosity, but has experienced stereotypes. The most famous stereotype is seen in The Grapes of Wrath in which the “Okies” are associated with being poor and uneducated. Contrary to the negative connotations, today Oklahomans use “Okie” in a positive way. English is spoken throughout the state but due to the Native American heritage of the area, high density of indigenous languages such as Apache, Cherokee and Choctaw are spoken.","The region has a continental climate with cold winters and hot summers. Oklahoma City average temperatures range from 3°C (37°F) in January to 28°C (82°F) in July, and tornados are common. Lightweights for the summer and heavyweights for the winter."
north-america,canada,"Energetic cities, sprawling forests and more than half a million lakes are just some of the reasons why Ontario pulls in the crowds. Most start their Ontario adventure in buzzing Toronto, a jewel in the province’s crown, whose multicultural inhabitants lend the city a genuinely cosmopolitan edge. You can cheer on the Maple Leafs in their quest for the Stanley Cup, glug the latest craft brew in historic pubs and stuff your face with mini doughnuts from a foodtruck. And what’s the point looking out the windows of the CN Tower when you can skirt its roof on the vertigo-inducing EdgeWalk? In Canada’s capital city, Ottawa, knowing whether to say “bonjour” or “hello” is always a quandary, so just say both. Skate the world’s largest ice rink, the Rideau Canal, or gen up on all things Canadian in the city’s fabulous museums. You don’t have to travel far to find nature. Equidistant from both cities, Algonquin Provincial Park is a quintessentially Canadian landscape of maple-blanketed hills splashed with thousands of lakes. It dishes up quintessentially Canadian experiences, too: wilderness hiking, 2,100km (1,300 miles) of canoeing routes, and the chance to land the biggest trout of your life. Also a short drive from Toronto are the booming Niagara Falls, one of the Seven Natural Wonders of the world. And then there are the lakes. Ontario borders four of the five Great Lakes, most notably Lake Huron, home to Fathom Five National Marine Park and its extraordinary shipwrecks. Elsewhere there are lakes for fishing, lakes for canoeing, lakes for swimming and lakes for diving. Come on in, the water’s lovely. 1,076,395 sq km (415,598 sq miles). 13.5 million (2016). 14.8 per sq km.

north-america,united-states-of-america,"Oregon doesn’t have to try hard: it has one of the hippest cities on the planet, snow-tipped volcanoes, a phenomenal coastline and more breweries per capita than any other US state. Portland (aka ‘Beervana’) practically invented hip and might as well have invented beer too. While other cities are just cottoning on to this microbrewery malarkey, Portland has been blending wheaty concoctions since the 1980s. With more breweries than any other city on Earth, plus tasting rooms, brew ‘n’ view cinemas and cracking beer festivals, you’re never likely to be without a hoppy ale in hand. But don’t forget about Portland’s awesome live music scene, 600-plus food trucks and its saucy side – The Heathman Hotel was the setting for some, ahem, energetic episodes in Fifty Shades of Grey. Drag yourself away from the bar to discover Oregon’s extraordinary scenery. Wild Pacific beaches stretch along 584km (363 miles) of coastline, where you can scramble over grass-flecked dunes, poke around rockpools teeming with sea stars, spot puffins perched on sea stacks, or listen out for barking sea lions. In winter, migrating grey whales journey down the coast on their way to Baja California. Head inland and take a road trip along the Historic Columbia River Highway, kite-surf at Hood River, tuck into homemade apple pie, sip the region’s stellar wine, or ride Mt Hood, home to the only year-round skiing on the continent.

Salem","Prehistoric evidence indicates that humans have lived in the area which forms present-day Oregon for over 15,000 years. It was originally inhabited by Paleo-Indians, but by the 16th century the area had become home to a number of Native American groups, no doubt drawn by the Columbia River as a prime site for catching fish. Groups that lived west towards the Pacific Coast developed sophisticated trade routes into modern day Canada and California. In the mid-16th century Spanish explorers set out for the North Pacific to establish colonies. In 1778 Captain James Cook landed on the Oregonian coast and named the area Cape Foulweather. Arguably the most famous explorers to reach Oregon were Merriwether Lewis and William Clark, who were commissioned by President Thomas Jefferson in 1804 to explore the west after the Louisiana Purchase. The Lewis and Clark Expedition caused a buzz about the Northwest. New York entrepreneur John Jacob Astor decided to finance a fur trading expedition to Oregon in 1810. Astoria was the first settlement on the Oregonian coast where Astor's Pacific Fur Company operated, however it quickly failed due to pressures from British fur traders. Christian missionaries travelled west in the 1830s paving the way for the 3,200 km (2,000-mile) Oregon Trail that would be followed by American settlers. In 1846 the USA and Britain established borders in the Oregon Treaty and two years later the Oregon Territory was established. In 1859 Oregon was granted statehood. The arrival of transcontinental railroads to the state in the late 19th century bolstered its wheat and lumber industries. Following the California gold rush, waves of Chinese male immigrants made their way up to Oregon where, despite racist and brutal treatment at some hands, they worked on railroads and in canneries. Japanese families also made their way to the state, seeking employment. By the turn of the century Oregon had evolved into a culturally diverse, yet socially troubled state. Thus, the Oregon System was created by politicians to foster reforms such as workers' and women's rights and the abolishment of capital punishment. This period of political improvement led to economic successes during WWI. Like the rest of the USA, Oregon was badly affected by the Great Depression; however it spawned an increase in infrastructure in the state to generate jobs and a DIY, home-grown culture. In 1942 Japanese-Americans in Oregon were subjected to President Franklin D. Roosevelt's Executive Order 9066, in which they were issued curfews and sent to internment camps during WWII. While the Japanese community in Oregon and other western states experienced detainment and economic setbacks, the state's economy thrived during and after the war. Since 1970s, Oregon has been a progressive state. It was the first US state to legalise physician-assisted suicide through the Oregon Death with Dignity Act in 1994. In 2014, Oregon became the second US state to legalise gay marriage and recreational marijuana. According to a 2009 poll, Oregon ranked as the top state with religiously unaffiliated residents coming in at 24.6%. Roman Catholics make up the majority of religiously affiliated population followed by Protestant groups. Oregonians are known to be friendly, but are often subjected to stereotypes such as a supposed dislike of Californians. The city of Portland bears recent stereotypes of hipster and environmentalist cultures. Whilst English is spoken by almost everyone, Oregon has a relatively high proportion of foreign-language speakers, with Spanish speakers being the largest minority.","The Pacific Ocean and the mighty Cascade mountain range influence Oregon's climate considerable. Oregon's west coast The weather is generally mild and wet on the west coast. Portland, Oregon's largest city, has a temperate oceanic climate and sees cloudy skies and light drizzles from November to March. The best time to visit Portland, Oregon is from June to September when the weather is at its best – pleasantly warm, dry, and with plenty of sunshine. In June, the average high is 23°C (73°F) while the average low is 12°C (54°F). Central Oregon On the east of the Cascade Range, this part of Oregon has dry summer and snowy winter. Bend, the largest city in Central Oregon, enjoys a predominately dry climate with over 300 sunny days a year, very low humidity and cool nights. Winters are snowy, making it an ideal winter sports location. The southwest region Bordering California, the Rogue Valley has a Mediterranean climate with drier and sunnier winters and hotter summers. Light cotton and linens during the summer months. Rainwear and heavyweight clothing suggested for the winter months."
north-america,panama,"Think Panama and what springs to mind? The canal? Cigars? Straw hats? Probably all three. However, for those in the know, this slender Central American nation is much more than that; it is a land of wildlife-rich rainforests and remote indigenous communities; Miami-esque promenades and paradisiacal beaches; verdant volcanoes and the impenetrable wilderness of the Darien Gap. Firstly, the canal. Though considered to be the star attraction (thousands flock here to watch container ships passing through the locks) the wild landscapes it scythes through are an altogether more exciting prospect. Here you can hike volcanoes, zip-wire over forest canopies, raft down rapids and meet one of the country’s largest indigenous groups, the Kunas, who eke out simple, traditional lives on the sumptuous San Blas Islands. The Caribbean coastline features another facet of Panamanian culture. Jamaicans and Barbadians, drafted in to build the canal, ended up settling here and an Afro-Caribbean vibe endures to this day. The nearby Bocas del Toro islands, meanwhile, are the definition of Caribbean island ideal with their palm-fringed beaches, limpid lagoons and sleepy eco-lodges. The wildlife is also spectacular. Whale watching in the Golfo de Chiriquí is a must and you never forget scuba diving or snorkeling alongside turtles in the Coiba National Marine Park. Its birdlife surpasses neighbouring Costa Rica and the most treasured sightings are the iconic harpy eagle, Panama’s national bird, and the endangered great green macaw. With so much natural beauty to imbibe, it is easy to overlook the bustling capital, Panama City. But don’t. A metropolis divided starkly between the past and present, it is a city where crumbling colonial buildings stand in the shadows of high-rise steel and glass towers. It feels a little bit like Miami and the locals certainly give their US counterparts a run for their money in the hedonism stakes.

President Laurentino Cortizo since 2019.","Panama’s earliest inhabitants were hunter-gatherers and lived on the land some 10,000 years ago. Apart from the remains of tribal people, archaeologists have discovered some traces of ancient life such as statues, gold ornaments, and some of the earliest ceramics ever found in the Americas. The Spanish arrived in 1502 and established the original Panama City less than 20 years later. Spain transformed the entire continent, establishing its own colonial society and obliterating the ancient civilisations. Panama City was the starting point of the expedition that ended up conquering the Inca Empire. After 300 years of colonial rule, the region finally gained independence from Spain in 1821 and formed the state known as Gran Colombia, which included Colombia, Venezuela, Panama and Ecuador. By the end of the century the territory was tearing itself apart and in 1903 Panama broke free from an unhappy union with neighbouring Colombia. The building of the Panama Canal, which was completed in 1914, was to change everything for Panama. 75,000 labourers of all nationalities flocked to Panama at the prospect of work and building a new life for themselves, bringing in a huge influx of different cultures. The US government bought the rights to the Panama Canal Zone, assuming a huge influence in the running of the country, and the wealth generated by the canal went largely to US interests. The 20th century was marked by political strife and wrestling matches over rights to the canal. Following his military coup in 1968, General Omar Torrijos Herrera imposed a dictatorship, which continued until his death in 1981. Torrijos was succeeded by his former intelligence chief, Manuel Noriega, who remained in power until 1989, by which time US relations had collapsed and financial assistance cut, in reaction to allegations of election fraud and drug trafficking. When President George Bush sent in a military invasion to wrest power from Noriega, in December 1989, the country was suffering from a crippling lack of funds. Panama struggled back to economic stability throughout the 1990s, ending positively with the defining moment of its history: the official handing over of the Panama Canal by the US to Panama, successfully concluding a treaty signed in 1977. The completion of a multi-billion dollar Panama Canal expansion project in 2016 more than doubled its operating capacity. Proposed by the then-Panamanian President Martín Torrijos, son of the former dictator, the project was completed a decade later under the current President of Panama, Juan Carlos Varela. Did you know? •	When General Noriega took refuge in the Vatican Embassy during the US invasion of 1989, they played loud rock music, including Van Halen (Panama) and the Clash (I Fought the Law), to drive him out. •	Panama has 59 of the world’s 356 species of hummingbird, including the smallest bird in the world, the 5-cm bee hummingbird. •	Panama Hats come from Ecuador, not Panama; they got their name in the 19th century because they were first shipped to Panama before being exported around the world. Almost all Christian; 90% Roman Catholic (FCO figures). Other representations include Protestants, Jews and Muslims. Handshaking is the normal form of greeting and dress is generally casual. The culture is a vibrant mixture of American and Spanish lifestyles. The mestizo majority, which is largely rural, shares many of the characteristics of mestizo culture found throughout Central America. Only three indigenous tribes have retained their individuality and traditional lifestyles as a result of withdrawing into virtually inaccessible areas. The official language is Spanish, but English is spoken in Panama City.","Temperatures are high across the whole country throughout the year, though cooler at high altitudes. The rainy season lasts from May to November, but even at this time of year rain rarely lasts all day – just take an umbrella for the downpours; the sun will be out again soon. There are fewer people around at this time, too, and so prices drop for the low season. Rainfall is twice as heavy on the Pacific coast as it is on the lowlands of the Caribbean coast. If you are planning to take a boat trip from Panama to >Colombia, avoid travelling from December to February, as at this time of year the seas are rough, trips get cancelled and everyone gets seasick. Surfing is possible and decent all year round on the Pacific side, but the best months are from November to April. For hiking, the dry season (December to April) is most comfortable. The dry season is also good for diving, because you’ll be able to see far better, but the rainy season means the rivers run high which is great for rafting. Lightweight cottons and linens are worn, with rainwear advisable, particularly in the rainy season. However, keep it light: just because it rains doesn’t mean it gets cold. Warmer clothes are needed in the highlands, especially in the dry season. If hiking and camping at a higher altitude, things can get very chilly indeed – make sure your sleeping bag can handle it. Hiking boots are great for the mountains, but most of the time you’ll be in flip-flops. Forget your mosquito repellent at your peril, and a mosquito net might come in handy too. Panama forms the land link between the North and South American continents. It borders Colombia to the east, Costa Rica to the west, and the Caribbean and the Pacific Ocean to the north and south. The country forms an S-shaped isthmus, which runs east-west over a total length of 772km (480 miles) and is 60 to 177km (37 to 110 miles) wide. The landscape is mountainous with lowlands on both coastlines cut by streams, wooded slopes and a wide area of savannah-covered plains and rolling hills called El Interior between the Azuero peninsula and the Central Mountains. To the east is the Darién province which is a humid area of swamp and forest with few inhabitants. The Darién Gap is the missing link in the Panamerican Highway, as extending the road through the dense jungle would be costly and environmentally destructive. The Caribbean and the Pacific Ocean are linked by the man-made Panama Canal, cut into a gap between the Cordillera de Talamanca and the San Blas mountain range and stretching for over 65km (40 miles); the length of the canal is often referred to as 80km (50 miles) as this is the distance between deep-water points of entry. Only about a quarter of the country is inhabited. The majority of the population live either around the canal and main cities of Panama City and Colón (the two cities which control the entrance and exit of the canal) or in the Pacific lowlands and the adjacent mountains."
north-america,united-states-of-america,"Energetic cities, gorgeous rural landscapes, world-class culture and history by the bucketload: Pennsylvania will leave you breathless. You can dip into 18th-century life at historic homesteads, trace the state’s industrial heritage in old mining villages and disused ironworks, and plant your feet on legendary battlefields. Philadelphia, its largest city, takes pride in its history. It was here that the country's Founding Fathers signed the Declaration of Independence, and for many visitors, the first port of call is Independence Hall and the Liberty Bell. Tick these off by all means, but do imbibe the city’s contemporary offerings; dive into the multi-ethnic culinary scene, sip craft ale at pop-up beer gardens, and pedal across the scenic Schuylkill Banks Boardwalk. If all this city action has you crying out for simpler times, look no further than the Amish community in Lancaster County, where horse-drawn buggies clatter along rural lanes, televisions and high fashion are a no-no, and life has barely changed for 300 years. The state’s western side has a different edge to it, lying on the cusp of the Midwest, with staunchly industrial roots. That said, Pittsburgh has dusted off its gritty image and emerged as a sophisticated arts and dining destination in its own right – well worth a visit.

The English, Dutch, and Swedes all made claims to the land with the Swedes becoming the first to make permanent settlement in 1638. However, in 1655 the Dutch took over the New Sweden settlement. The victory was short-lived, and as the British expanded their colonies in America, they defeated the Dutch and took control over the region in 1664. In 1681, William Penn, a devout Quaker, was granted the territory by King Charles II in lieu of a debt the sovereign had owed to his father. King Charles II named the new colony after Penn's father, combining it with the Latin word for woods or “forest land”, sylvania. Penn created a haven in the New World by granting asylum to the persecuted under conditions of equality and freedom.      Tension grew between France, Great Britain and the colonies for dominance over Pennsylvania. In 1754, the Native Americans joined forces with the British Colonies’ other enemy, the French, and thus in 1756 began what would become known as the French and Indian War. The British won, and by 1776, the Province of Pennsylvania had become one of the largest English colonies in America. Pennsylvania’s residents generally rallied behind protests against the Stamp Act of 1765 (which required those in the New World colonies to pay taxes back to Britain) and the Proclamation of 1763 (which would outlaw private purchases of Native American lands, and create a boundary between the British colonies and the American Indian lands). Because of this, Pennsylvania played an important role in the American Revolutionary war between 1775 and 1783. Philadelphia, the state’s largest city, became the nation’s capital during the revolution until 1800 when the capital settled in the District of Columbia. In Philadelphia, the First Continental Congress took place in 1774 and the Second Continental Congress on May 1775, where delegates discussed matters that they would later draft into the Declaration of Independence on 4 July 1776. After the Revolutionary War, Pennsylvania became the site of many important events in American history. In 1780, Pennsylvania was the first state to pass a legislation to abolish slavery. Later in 1787, the Federal Constitutional Convention met in Philadelphia where it would later adopt the official United States Constitution on 17 September 1787. Pennsylvania became the second state to ratify the constitution, after Delaware, on 12 December thus gaining its statehood. In 1861, tension between the northern and southern states erupted into what would be known as the American Civil War. Because of its opposition to slavery and support of the federation, Pennsylvania played an important role in preserving the Union. Pennsylvania was the target of several raids by the Confederate States Army, the southern states in rebellion, and was used to shield the northern states. The state was also the site of the bloodiest battle in the Revolutionary War; the Battle of Gettysburg in 1863. Between 46,000 and 51,000 soldiers from both armies were casualties in the three-day battle. On 19 November 1863, President Abraham Lincoln delivered the Gettysburg Address at the site of the battle. The speech became one of the most famous and well known in the nation and addressed the issues of human equality that would impact the rest of American history. Economically, Pennsylvania was hit hard by a downturn in the steel manufacturing and heavy industry during the late 20th century which had been its mainstay, with the cities of Pittsburgh and Philadelphia facing increasing levels social unrest during the 60s and 70s. More recently the state’s economy has begun to recover, attracting immigrants into the region and programmes of gentrification and revitalisation are under way. Because of the Religious Freedom Protection Act passed in December 2002, Pennsylvania is known to be respectful of different religions. Half of the nation regards themselves as religious, with a majority being Protestant. Other religions such as Methodist, Jewish and Islam are also practiced throughout the state by minorities. The state is very diverse, its populace is relatively evenly split between conservatives and liberals and has a wide range of opinions. Philadelphia is known as a multi-cultural city with its distinct arts, music, and food culture. Higher education is highly regarded and Pennsylvania houses the well-known Carnegie Mellon University. English is the primary language spoken in Pennsylvania. Like most other US states, Spanish is also widely spoken. The Pennsylvania German Language is still preserved among the descendants of the Pennsylvania Dutch.","Pennsylvania's weather can be changeable, with moderate amounts of rain throughout the year. Summers are long and warm with occasional heat waves. The southeastern corner in the state has the warmest climate whereas the mountainous area of Pennsylvania is considerably colder. Winter temperatures can drop significantly and come with periods of snowfall, especially in the western part of the state. The best time to visit is during autumn. September the temperature drops down to 21˚C (70˚F). By October, the weather drops again with the high of 15˚C (60˚F). Warm winter clothes are needed in the coldest months. In preparation for the winter weather wear warm pants, long sleeve shirts, winter coat and boots. Light-to-medium weights are advised for the summer.

In 1644, the settlements of Providence, Newport, and Portsmouth united to become the ‘Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations.’ The four towns were united by the ‘Royal Charter of 1663 which granted them a greater degree of self-government than any other colony in the New World. Although there was an alliance between the settlers and the Narragansett Indians, tension grew between the two and by 1675 one of the most traumatic events in Rhode Island’s history occurred. King Philip’s War, named after the Wampanoag chief’s nickname of ‘King Philip’, broke out in Narragansett Bay when the Native American tribes attacked. Despite Rhode Island remaining neutral, many of its towns were burnt down and destroyed by the attacks. Between the 17th and 18th centuries, Rhode Island was heavily involved in the slave trade. Although it passed the first abolition law in 1652, Rhode Island still housed one of the highest slave populations among the 13 colonies until the late 18th century when legislature passed a compromise measure for gradual emancipation of slaves. During the Revolutionary era, Rhode Island was eager to gain its independence. Already known for their defiance, Rhode Islanders led one of the first overt acts of rebellion, by attacking the British Warship HMS Gaspee in 1772. On May 4, 1776, Rhode Island became the first British colony to declare its independence. After gaining this, the state tried to expel the British army from its nation and so the Battle of Rhode Island broke out in 1778. Although the war was unsuccessful, the British later abandoned the area the following year in order to concentrate their forces in New York. Following this, industrial growth began in Rhode Island and in 1790 English immigrant Samuel Slater founded the first water-powered textile mill in America in Pawtucket. Because of the Industrial Revolution, the cities attracted more workers and large numbers of immigrants from Ireland creating a class who made up 60% of free white males that did not own land and could not vote.  In 1842, Rhode Island native Thomas Dorr drafted a liberal constitution to remedy the situation but was struck down by the conservative sitting governor. This lead to the Dorr Rebellion, a short lived insurrection, and later that year the constitution was modified, allowing any white male who owned land or could pay the $1 poll tax, to vote. Since 1997 bills have been introduced to the Rhode Island General Assembly every year to try to legalise gay marriage. Finally after 16 years, in January 2013, Rhode Island House of Representatives passed a bill to legalise same-sex marriage. On May 2, 2013 Governor Lincoln Chafee signed the bill into law and as of August 1, 2013, the state will recognize and license same-sex marriages. Rhode Island is the last state in New England to legalise gay marriage. Over half of the population of Rhode Island is affiliated with a religion with 45% of these population being Catholic. Although almost half of the population identifies as Catholic, the state is heavily Democratic and holds progressive views. The capital, Providence, is known as the 'creative capital' for its extensive educational resources and arts community. The primary language spoken in Rhode Island is English with a northeastern American dialect. Because of its large immigrant population, more than 20% of the population speaks a language other than English, with most speaking Spanish.",Rhode Island's climate is milder than that of the other New England states. Winters are relatively cold with temperatures ranging from -6.1 to 2.2°C (21 to 36°F) and summer temperatures averaging between 17.2 and 27.2°C (63 to 81°F). Precipitation is fairly evenly distributed throughout the year. Cottons and linens for summer months and heavyweights with extra bundling for the winter months.
north-america,canada,"Known affectionately as the Land of the Living Skies, Saskatchewan offers abundant wildlife, crowd-free national parks and some of the most impressive heavens you’re likely to encounter – the shape-shifting Northern Lights are one of its biggest lures. Although vast swathes of farmland and prairie cover a significant proportion of this province, head north and these give way to rippling hills, boreal forest and an aquatic bonanza of around 100,000 lakes and rivers. Saskatchewan isn’t a place for rushing around. It’s a place for lying outstretched in a field and gazing at a flock of geese piercing the endless blue sky or escaping city crowds and hunkering down for a peaceful retreat on a sprawling farm. If you’re itching to get active though, there’s plenty of space to move. Saddle up and ride towards the sunset in the Cypress Hills or experience life as a cowboy on a cattle drive. Swim, boat or hook giant trout on the humongous Lake Diefenbaker. Hike, canoe or kayak through the thick boreal forest of Prince Albert National Park, where you can spy moose, elk and bears. And if you do need an urban hit, Saskatoon reels you in with its attractive river trails, cosmopolitan eateries and eclectic festival line-up. And then there’s Regina, where you can catch sight of Mounties-in-training at the country’s only Royal Canadian Mounted Police training academy and learn about the force’s history at the slick Arthur Erickson-designed RCMP Heritage Centre. Before you go, kit yourself out in green and white and join the rambunctious Saskatchewan Roughriders fans in roaring on the side at a high-energy Canadian Football game. 651,036 sq km (251,366 sq miles). 1.1 million (2016). 1.9 per sq km.

north-america,united-states-of-america,"Sultry climes, a captivating history and enticing scenery: welcome to South Carolina y’all.  The ‘Palmetto State’ is blessed with stunning landscapes – from the rolling hills of the Upcountry to the glistening lakes of the midlands – but it’s the coastline that lures most visitors.  Plant your parasol on the sun-drenched shores of Myrtle Beach for classic seaside fun, with boardwalk amusements, boogie boarding and boat tours all up for grabs. The city is also home to the South Carolina Civil War Museum, which tells the story of the conflict through the eyes of the state. Beaufort on Port Royal Island is easy on the eye thanks to its raft of beautifully restored antebellum homes. But if you’re looking to escape the cities, take a trip to Hilton Head, a narrow barrier island that’s generously clad with beautiful beaches, unspoiled forest and world-class golf courses. With its lack of skyscrapers and bevy of 19th-century mansions, the coastal metropolis of Charleston is anything but an identikit US city. It’s the site of the country’s first permanent European settlement and today crackles with a stellar dining scene, characterful boutique hotels and Southern charm aplenty. Away from the coast, South Carolina’s back roads offer visitors the chance to pick juicy peaches, explore rambling plantations and encounter Revolutionary and Civil War sites and re-enactments. Beyond that take in the terrific museums of the state capital, Columbia, waterski across Lake Murray, or paddle through Congaree National Park’s murky creeks and hardwood forests. And don’t leave without visiting the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains, where you can hike and bike to your heart’s content. 80,782 sq km (31,190 sq miles). 4.9 million (2015). 60.7 per sq km. Columbia.","South Carolina was primarily inhabited by Cherokee and Catbawba tribes before the Spanish and French explorers arrived in the area in the 16th century. Attempts at settlement failed but in 1629, King Charles I granted his attorney general the land of present-day South Carolina and North Carolina, naming it ‘Province of Carlana.’ The first English settlement was made in 1670 in Albemarle Point but due to poor conditions, was relocated to the site of Charleston, originally named ‘Charles Town’ after the King. During the Revolutionary War, about 25,000 slaves escaped, migrated north or died during the war, with 13,000 joining the British Army who promised them freedom if they rebelled against their slave owners and fought with them. After the war, many northern states abolished slavery and numerous slaves were freed. However, South Carolina had more slave owners in government than any other state, resulting in the passing of manumission laws in 1800 and 1820, which made it more difficult for freed slaves to grant their family freedom.  On 20 December 1860, South Carolina became the first state to secede from the Federal Union after the election of Abraham Lincoln. A year later, South Carolina had joined the Confederacy along with Mississippi, Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana and Texas. During the Civil War the state suffered greatly and when in 1965, General William T. Sherman led his army to Columbia, many plantations in the state were destroyed. From the 1870s onwards, interracial tensions between the white and black population increased with groups such as the Ku Klux Klan and the Red Shirts frequently committing violent acts. Continued tensions and lack of rights for blacks (only 0.8% of the black population was able to vote by 1940) led many to head to cities in the northern states, a process known as the Great Migration. Despite many obstacles, the Civil Rights movement brought an end to overt discrimination and segregation in the state and two years after the massacre, three African Americans were elected to the state legislature. Economically, by the 1970s, South Carolina’s economy had waned in parallel with its agriculture industry. Unemployment in the state after the 2008 financial crisis reached a peak of 12% before declining to 8.9% in 2012. Most of the population of South Carolina identifies as Christian, with Protestant being the most common affiliation. Only about 5% of the population is non-religious and 1% identifies with another religion. Southern American culture is very prominent in South Carolina as well as the Gullah (descendants of slaves) culture in the low country region in which brings in many African influences. Although areas of Charleston and Colombia can be more progressive, South Carolina still remains predominantly conservative. The primary language spoken in South Carolina is English with a Southern American dialect. About 5% of the population speak a language other than English, and of these Spanish or Spanish Creole the most frequently spoken.","South Carolina has a humid, sub-tropical climate, with long, hot summers and short, mild winters. Spring and autumn are the most pleasant seasons. In winter, temperatures generally average 5 to 7°C (40 to 45°F) in inland areas, and 12 to 15ºC (55 to 60°F) by the shore. Summer temperatures, modified by mountains in some areas and by sea breezes in others, range from 24 to 29ºC (75 to 85°F), and can reach as high as 32ºC (90°F) and above. Lightweights are advised throughout the year, with warmer clothes for winter. Beachwear is popular, and protection from the midday sun, such as sunglasses and sun hats, is advisable."
north-america,united-states-of-america,"Shhh, don’t tell anyone, but South Dakota is something of a Midwest secret. A land of windswept prairies, pioneer towns, dramatic badlands and four gigantic presidents, the state has much to offer – but it doesn’t like to shout about it. The Black Hills are South Dakota’s crowning glory, boasting a cluster of national parks, monuments and memorials. The most famous among them is Mount Rushmore National Memorial, where the faces of George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Theodore Roosevelt and Abraham Lincoln have been blasted and carved out of the mountain. Equally curious is the Crazy Horse Memorial, which will be the world's largest mountain sculpture when completed. The 22-storey statue features Crazy Horse – a Native American war leader – riding a stallion and pointing into the distance. Work began in 1948 and the finish date is unknown. If you want to shake off snap-happy tour groups, then trek among stripy canyons, spires and ragged buttes in Badlands National Park, home to bison, bighorn sheep and prairie dogs (alive and well), as well as sabre-toothed cats, ancient rhinos and three-toed horses (dead and fossilised). Duck beneath the prairie and admire the intricate honeycomb formations in Wind Cave, one of the world’s longest caves. Or get a feel for US-Soviet Cold War tensions at Minuteman Missile, where a flick of a switch could have launched WWIII. Slicing through the middle of the state, the Missouri River lures hikers, bikers, kayakers and anglers, who hook walleye, pike and perch. South Dakota is a big hunting spot too.

Pierre.","European explorers first came across what is today South Dakota in 1742 with the La Vérendrye brothers. The explorer duo buried a lead plate and effectively claimed the land for France, despite the presence of the Arikara and Lakota Sioux people who populated it. The land was transferred to US control in the Louisiana Purchase, headed by Thomas Jefferson in 1803 and explored by the Lewis and Clarke expedition. It wasn’t until 1817 that the first official settlement, Fort Pierre, was erected on the west bank of the Missouri River, and the state truly began to develop. A military expedition headed by the ill-fated George Custer discovered gold in the Black Hills in 1742, bringing on an onslaught of fortune-hunters. Crossing illegally into land promised to the Lakota Sioux, self-styled miners created major tension between the settlers and the tribe. War broke out as the Lakota Sioux refused to grant mining permission and the US failed to keep miners from entering the land. This war ended with the defeat of the Sioux and the breakup of the Great Sioux reservation into five reservations. The Lakota are still trying to get their stolen land back, refusing any offer of monetary compensation. As the population grew, the Dakota territory was split into North and South and in 1889 were admitted to the Union as the 39th and 40th states in an unrecorded order. A year after being granted statehood, one of the most grievous events in the state’s history befell the Lakota Sioux nation. At Wounded Knee more than 250 Lakota men, women and children, many unarmed and fleeing were shot down in a struggle that ensued during an arms confiscation by the military. The Wounded Knee Massacre was a tragic product of building tensions and mutual distrust between the government and the indigenous people.   In an effort to promote tourism, 1927 saw the start of the Mount Rushmore National Memorial in the Black Hills.  The likenesses of presidents George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Theodore Roosevelt and Abraham Lincoln were carved into the mountain – each face is 18m (60ft) tall. Completion took 14 years and set the state back US$989,990.  They succeeded however, as Mount Rushmore is now one of the US’s major tourist attractions. Three years into the carving of Mount Rushmore, South Dakota suffered from a terrible drought, coupled with the Great Depression culminating in the Dust Bowl. Massive emigration ensued as out-of-work Dakotans set out looking for a new source of income.  Between the 1930s and 40s the population dipped by more than 7%. WWII bolstered the US’s economy and brought South Dakota back to stability.  The state that had traditionally relied on agriculture, started to diversify its economy. Rural areas struggled to survive as small family-owned farms couldn’t compete with mechanization. With the diversification of economy, South Dakota has emerged from being a solely agricultural state. It still identifies closely with its history and agricultural roots, but new economic opportunities have sprouted in South Dakota.  However, rural areas struggle as younger generations emigrate to bigger cities. The dominating religion of the state is Christianity (protestant and catholic) and minority groups of religion include Judaism and Lutheran. Religious buildings in the state include St John’s Catholic Church in Dallas and Emmanuel Episcopal Church in Rapid City. In South Dakota, religion is an important factor of every day life and people attend church frequently. Much of the culture in the state stems from a rural, western history and this is celebrated by numerous events celebrated throughout the year such as the Redwall Canyon Cowboy Music Festival. There are common misconceptions that the state is not quite up to date with the latest technologies and that every other citizen must be a farmer. However South Dakota is one of the most diverse states in the US in terms of economy and landscapes. A very high proportion of the state's residents speak only English is the main language, although some Native American words have made it into common parlance. A small minority also speak German.","Winters are extremely cold and windy, with adequate snow for winter sports.

More expeditions were held in 1559 by Tristan de Luna and 1567 by Juan Pardo. It was Pardo's recording of the name ""Tanasqui"" from a local tribal village that has evolved into the state's current name. Europeans began to flow in over the next few centuries and started complex relationships with the native people. During the American Revolutionary War (1775-1783), Tennessee, at that point wasn't a state nor had an organised government, saw the land being divided and given to various settlers. After the Revolution, it continued to see conflicts as different groups fought to claim rights to tracts of land, and the disputes only ended in 1796 when Tennessee became the 16th State of the Union. When the American Civil War broke out in 1861, Tennessee once again saw further conflicts, this time with Governor Harris siding with the Confederacy while the people in East Tennessee wanted to stay with the Union. Finally, on June 8th, the state voted for secession. The event prompted many Unionists to flee to other states or join the Federal forces. When the Civil War ended in 1865, Tennessee re-joined the Union. Tennessee today is a prosperous state relying on crop and livestock production. Tennessee is part of the Bible Belt; hence it is no surprise that most people identify themselves as Christians or Catholics. It is said that there are over 11,000 churches in Tennessee. Southern hospitality, referring to people behave in a friendly way and guests feel accepted, is widely practised here. Apart from kindness and helpfulness, this way of life also includes good home cooking, charm, charity and politeness, as defined by the revered Southern Living magazine.

Similar in size to France, almost everything in Texas appears larger than life: the mountains, the cities, the food portions, and yes, some of the people too. The so-called Lone Star State is world renowned for its Wild West spirit and a brazen “don’t mess with Texas” attitude. But there is more to this state than big-headed cowboys, small-town girls and nationalistic defiance. Texas is home to cosmopolitan cities, sprinkled with creative businesses, smart urban types, internet millionaires and artistic communities. The capital Austin is dynamic and happening, with a lively music scene, retro vibe and boutique stores. The state’s largest city, Houston, is an expansive, multi-ethnic metropolis with plenty of charm and is famously the home of NASA. Dallas glitters with a shimmering high-rise skyline, elegant stores, fine restaurants and a rich cultural and sporting life.

The beginning of the European colonisers began with the arrival of the Spanish exploration headed by Alonso Álvarez de Pineda in 1520. After settling, there were many attempts from the French to ambush the Spanish and to colonize the land for French ownership. However, this wasn’t successful and the Spanish declared Texas as a colony and in 1691 appointed Texas with its first governor Domingo Terán de los Ríos. In 1799 the Spanish ceded control of Louisiana to the French but the agreement was unclear over borders. So much so, that when the French later sold the state of Louisiana to the US in1803, the US believed that the deal also included the Texas area due to boundary confusions. Due to this, Napoleon demanded that the king of Spain should abdicate. The result of this was an attempt by both Mexican and US revolutionaries to declare Mexico and Texas independent. Although unsuccessful, eventually, in 1821 Texas became a part of Mexico, which was newly independent from Spain. The state’s Hispanic legacy has left its mark with place names such as San Antonio and from names of rivers such as Rio Grande. Within years of becoming part of Mexico, unrest began to take place over political disputes of land and colonialism which created the Texan revolution in 1835. In only three months, Texan forces successfully defeated the Mexican forces and so a year later signed the Texas Declaration of Independence, effectively making Texas a new republic. Continued disagreements rumbled on but in 1845, the US congress passed a bill allowing it to annex the Republic of Texas, thus making it a US state. Mexico strongly opposed annexation and the Mexican-American war took hold. In 1861, Texas joined the Confederate States of America siding with the south during the Civil War between the North and South. However, by 1865 the Confederacy had collapsed, in part due to the economic difficulties caused by war. After the war, Texas grew increasely prosperous due to the growth of industries such as ranching and banking, leading to wealthier citizens and higher standards of living. WWII affected Texas significantly, creating more jobs for people working within new military factories, and less people working on traditional ranches. The shortage in farm workers meant that Mexican migrants were brought in, due to their acceptance of lower wages. When the war ended, Texas began its transformation and modernized to what it is today along with the rest of the US. This included the oil boom that brought along huge economic benefits for the local economy and for citizens of Texas. Unlike the rest of the United States, the majority of the religion that is practiced in Texas is Roman Catholicism. Other denominations include Baptists and Methodists. Texans can be described as typical southerners as their values generally tend to to be conservative, although pockets such as Austin, may be described as somewhat more liberal. Greetings can include a quick, “How do you do?” Traditional customs such as men holding doors open for women are commonplace, as are somewhat conservative views about gender roles within society. Topics such as abortion and politics are likely to be highly controversial due to the state’s highly religious demographics. Texas has no official language. However the most dominant language is by far English. Not far behind, Spanish is spoken by 27% of the population because of Texas’s close proximity to Mexico.","Texas is the second biggest state in America (Alaska is the largest state) with varying climates but, on average, temperatures rarely go above 35°C (96°F) or below 0-5°C (32-45°F).

The options, it seems, are endless. The USA’s manmade landscapes are nearly as spectacular as the natural ones. New York City boasts some of the most impressive skyscrapers on the planet (think Empire State Building, Chrysler Building, Rockefeller Centre), although the skylines of Seattle, Chicago, LA and Vegas are no less recognisable. The American people are similarly diverse; from the colourful Cubans of the southeast to the gun-slinging wranglers of Texas and hardy Inuits of Alaska, the country is a melting pot of cultures.

The American War of Independence (1775–1783) ended colonial rule and by 1853, the boundaries of the mainland United States were, with the exception of Alaska, as they are today. Economic activity in the southern States centred on plantation agriculture where attempts to end slavery were fiercely opposed and the election of Lincoln to the presidency in 1861 resulted in the American Civil War as the southern States seceded from the Union. After four years of bloody fighting the more powerful Union forces prevailed and the country entered a period of consolidation, building up an industrial economy. The mid- and late-19th century also saw the development of foreign policy as formal links were established with the old colonial powers. In Europe, US intervention in 1917 proved decisive for the Allies in WWI and signalled the emergence of the USA as a global power. Driven by free-market economics and innovative production methods the USA became the world’s leading economy. It entered WWII and by its end had developed nuclear weapons and the superpower conflict that dominated the late 20th century. Its post-war foreign policy saw the US increase its global military presence, fighting in Korea, Vietnam and multiple interventions in the Middle East. Relations between the USA and the USSR improved greatly after 1985 under the new Gorbachev government. In 1988, George Bush was elected to the White House as the Eastern Bloc collapsed and the Cold War thawed. He was followed by Bill Clinton who served two terms characterised by a growing economy before George W Bush won the 2000 presidential election in controversial circumstances and shaped a more aggressive and jingoistic US foreign policy, particularly after the terrorist attacks on the United States in 2001. In November 2008 a record turnout returned Barack Obama as the country’s first black president who also served two terms in the White House. In late 2016, businessman and television personality Donald Trump defeated Hilary Clinton to become the 45th president of the United States. Did you know? • The United States of America is made up of 50 states, the federal district of Washington, D.C., five major self-governing territories and a range of other assets. • Famously called America’s only true art form, jazz grew out of the sounds and rhythms brought over by African slaves mixed with European folk traditions and popular songs. • Among the inventions claimed by Americans are the telephone, the phonograph, the electric light bulb, the movie camera, the assembly line and the aeroplane. Nearly half of all Americans are Protestant with Roman Catholic, Mormon, Jewish and many ethnic minorities. An increasing percentage of Americans are distancing themselves from formal religious affiliations; more than 19% declared no affiliation in 2015. Americans are renowned for their openness and friendliness to visitors. Shaking hands is the usual form of greeting. A relaxed and informal atmosphere is usually the norm. As long as the fundamental rules of courtesy are observed, there need be no fear of offending anyone of any background. Gifts are appreciated if one is invited to a private home. As a rule, dress is casual. High-end restaurants, hotels and clubs may require more formal attire. Smoking is increasingly unpopular in the US; it is essential to ask permission before lighting up. Smoking is not allowed on city transport and restricted or forbidden in public buildings in most states. An increasing number of states (including California and New York) have banned smoking altogether in many public places. The wide variety of national origins and the USA's relatively short history has resulted in numerous cultural and traditional customs living alongside each other. In large cities, people of the same ethnic background often live within the same communities, although race relations remain fraught in certain regions, as highlighted by the Ferguson riots in 2014 and Baltimore protests in 2015. English is the main language, with significant Spanish-speaking minorities (12.9%).","The United States has varied weather conditions, and the best time to visit depends both upon the location and the season. Spring (March- May) and autumn (September-November) are generally cooler, more comfortable times to visit. The summer months (June-August) are generally hot regardless of the region, but winter temperatures (December-February) can vary substantially depending upon the part of the US you are visiting. The southern part of the country tends to be warmer than the north. The general climate of the continental US is temperate, but keep in mind that Hawaii is tropical and Alaska is arctic. Many of the country's dependent territories, such as Guam, Puerto Rico, and the US Virgin Islands, are also tropical. Summer is considered the peak tourist season throughout the country; other popular travel times are major American holidays, especially Thanksgiving and Christmas, as well as Easter Week and the school holiday known as Spring Break. Certain destinations, such as New York, are perennial favourites and are busy year-round; even when the weather may not be pleasant, these destinations have particular attractions or experiences that always draw travellers. In some parts of the country, travel services may be limited during the low or off-season, largely due to weather conditions. As the US is a vast country with varying climates and four distinct seasons, packing clothing that allows you to layer for warmer and cooler conditions is recommended, especially if you plan to travel to different regions of the country. What you pack will largely depend upon the kinds of activities you plan to enjoy. Outdoor-lovers will need clothing and shoes that are appropriate for the terrain and the activities they have planned; visitors to cities will need a range of casual outfits and perhaps one smarter outfit for a night of fine dining or theatre. Covering a large part of the North American continent, the USA shares borders with Canada to the north and Mexico to the south. The country has coasts on the Atlantic, Pacific and Arctic oceans, the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico. The State of Alaska, in the northwest corner of the US, is not part of the continental US; it is separated from the rest of the USA by Canada. Similarly, Hawaii is not part of the 'lower 48' states; it lies in the central Pacific Ocean. The country's dependent territories are offshore and have distinct geographies of their own; the majority are islands. The third-largest country in the world (after the Russian Federation and Canada), the USA has an enormous diversity of geographical features, including mountains, plains, and coastal zones. Though there are many cities that are densely populated with more manmade features than natural ones, there are also vast rural areas that are far more sparsely populated. The climate ranges from subtropical to arctic, with a corresponding breadth of flora and fauna.

The Beehive State’s national parks are a whirlwind of wind-carved canyons, chequerboard rock faces, fragile rock arches and vermilion spires. You can climb sculpted sandstone at Capitol Reef or barrel down Class V rapids in Canyonlands’ Cataract Canyon. Weave through Fiery Furnace’s labyrinthine canyons at Arches or snap sunset at Bryce Canyon as an army of hoodoos goes to sleep. Throw any fear of heights to one side and hike the nerve-racking trail to Angels Landing for outstanding views over Zion National Park. Not enough for you? How about tracking a stegosaurus (or at least its fossil) at Dinosaur National Monument? Or take a drive along Heritage Highway 89 for a dose of classic Americana. Unleash your inner cowboy and saddle up at a dude ranch for some cattle wrangling. Then test your mountain-biking mettle on the legendary Slickrock Trail in Moab. Utah’s adventures don’t stop when the snow falls. You can test the state’s claim to have ‘the greatest snow on earth’ and launch yourself into vertiginous chutes at a world-renowned line-up of ski resorts in the Wasatch Mountains, or arm yourself with peeps and a shovel and hit the backcountry for untracked powder and rollercoaster tree runs. Grab a couple of days’ urban action in Salt Lake City. The Church of the Latter Day Saints might spring to mind when you think of Utah’s capital city, and the Salt Lake Temple does dominate town.

Salt Lake City.","The first inhabitants of Utah can be traced back 12,000 years ago when the Palaeolithic people lived near the marshes of the Great Basin. Spanish explorers and fur trappers passed through en route to the California coast but until 1847 when the Mormon pioneers arrived, the area was home to Native American groups such as the Northern Shoshone and Navajo tribes. After seeing no permanent Indian settlements in Salt Lake Valley, the members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, popularly known as Mormons, set up their community. At that time, the land was owned by Mexico, but after losing the Mexican-American war, Mexico signed the Treaty of Guadeloupe Hidalgo which ceded this land to the US. Conflict with the Shoshone Indians over recompense for the lands taken, arose but their claims were rejected. Previous petitons for statehood having been rejected, in 1850 the Utah Territory was created with the Compromise of 1850. But tension grew between the federal government and the Mormons when in 1854 the polygamous practices of the Mormons became public. Many saw this as rebellious and un-American, and this became another obstacle to obtaining statehood, with federal laws against polyamory issued during the 1870s and 1880s. Due to its geographic position, Utah was not heavily involved in the Civil War. However tensions arose between the Indians and the few soldiers stationed in the area, as the US tried to gain more land and in 1863 the Bear River Massacre saw the US army kill between 200 and 400 Shoshone Indians. Two years later, the seven-year Black Hawk War began, which consisted of 150 battles between the local and federal militia and several Indian tribes. Utah was one of the first states to grant women suffrage in 1870, second to Wyoming. The vote came to Utah women effortlessly as it was solely promoted by men who were ex-members of the Mormon Church and anti-polygamous advocates for women’s suffrage in the east. However their suffrage was repealed by the Edmunds-Tucker Act, a national effort to rid the territory of polygamy by fining anyone who practiced it and imprisoning them up to five years. The right to vote was finally restored in 1895, five years after the 1890 Manifesto in which the Mormons agreed to drop its approval of polygamy. A year later, the federal government finally granted the territory statehood as long as they included a ban on polygamy in their state constitution. During the late 20th century century, Utah’s economy boomed as the area became recognised for its natural beauty and national parks were established. As the location of many hit films, like 2001: A Space Odyssey and Forrest Gump, Utah has seen a large boost in tourism, particularly for winter sports and its profile was raised even more with the hosting of the 2002 Winter Olympics. A large population of the state are still affiliated with the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints with 62% of the Utah population being members. Catholics make up 10% of the population, while 28% are non-religious. Because of its strong Mormon influence, Utah holds primarily conservative views. These views are reflected in their alcohol laws, which are the most conservative in the USA. Utah is one of 18 control states, where the state has a monopoly over the wholesaling and retailing of all alcoholic beverages. Currently, the limit for any alcohol beverages sold in convenience stores is 3.2%; anything above that can only be sold in state liquor stores or clubs and restaurants with a liquor license. Liquor is also only served between 1130 and midnight and beer served until 0100. Utah has the highest fertility rate in the US and because of this, the state offers many family-friendly activities and attractions. Lots of establishments tend to have kids and family discounts and because Mormon families observe Monday evening as a time to spend together, a lot of establishments also offer family discounts on Mondays. English is the primary language spoken in Utah with 88% of the population speaking only English. Like most other US states, Spanish is also widely spoken with German and Navajo among the other languages spoken.","Utah enjoys a distinct four-season climate. In summer the days are hot, with cool nights. In winter, the temperatures are low with snow in the north. The climate varies from north to south and from desert to mountain. Summer days are hot in the desert but temperatures drop dramatically at night. Heavyweight clothing for the winter months and lightweights (cottonsand linens) for the summer months. Travellers will need extra clotheswhen travelling in the mountains in summer or winter."
north-america,united-states-of-america,"Big-city life takes a backseat in the ‘Green Mountain State,’ which certainly lives up to its nickname. But it’s not all verdant peaks: Vermont boasts shimmering lakes, scenic road trips and action aplenty. Yes, it’s the only New England state without a coastline, but Lake Champlain certainly makes up for it. On its shore sits Burlington, Vermont’s largest city, which is more of a town really. It’s one of those places everyone wants to move to, humming with creative entrepreneurs who take their dogs to work and clock off early to kayak, bike or catch the last chairlift. Part of the fun of Vermont is hitting the road and seeing where you end up. The state is famous for its vivid autumn foliage, white clapboard villages and rickety wooden bridges. Alternatively, leave the car behind and hike a section of the Appalachian Trail or trek the 438km (272mile) Long Trail, the USA's oldest long-distance hiking trail, which links Massachusetts with the Canadian border. In winter, ski a terrific line-up of downhill and cross-country areas in the Green Mountains. World-class resort Killington switches to mountain biking when the snow melts, while Stowe is home to the Trapp Family Lodge. Yes, as in the von Trapp family. As in ‘the hills are alive’. The lodge is still run by Maria’s youngest son. All that activity surely justifies foodie indulgence. Vermont produces more than 40% of the country’s maple syrup, so pour copious amounts on a pile of pancakes, along with an oversized dollop of Ben and Jerry’s ice cream, a Vermont staple. 24,900 sq km (9,614 sq miles). 626,042 (2015). 25.1 per sq km.

Champlain soon allied with the Native American Abenaki tribe and to killing an Iroquois chief in a bid to impress. The French then claimed Vermont as part of New France, the first European settlement in the state. In the next century, several European settlements were established throughout Vermont including the British and the Dutch. It wasn’t until the French Indian War that the British officially acquired the territory from France with the 1763 Treaty of Paris. As British colonies began settling in Vermont, lands started overlapping and friction commenced. New Hampshire and New York disputed on their boundaries of their land in Vermont and New Hampshire claimed their grants in the territory. But in 1764 British authorities declared the grants void and upheld New York’s claim to the territory. Violence erupted as New Hampshire resisted to give up their land and so formed the Green Mountain Boys, an armed bands formed under Ethan Allen to prevent Vermont from becoming part of New York. The Battle of Bennington was a major turning point in the American Revolutionary War as the victory galvanised colonial support and played a role in bringing France into the rebel side. The victory is still celebrated today as a state-wide holiday. Vermont finally became independent in 1777 but it was not until 1791 that the territory gained its statehood. It was the first state to be admitted to the union after the adoption of the Constitution by the original 13 states. In the 19th century, Vermont became a prominent area during the Civil War. In June 1843, escaped slaves arrived in Vermont as the first recorded instance of the Underground Railroad, a historical network of secret routes and safe houses used by escaped slaves to flee to free states and Canada. During the war, Vermont changed its views dramatically from Democratic to Republican, and in 1860 it voted for President Abraham Lincoln, giving him the largest margin of victory of any state. Vermont was also very involved in the war, with an estimated 28,100 Vermont residents working in volunteer units. During the 19th and 20th century, Vermont’s economy boomed as railroads expanded and mills started popping up in New England employing masses of people. On 25 April 2000, a bill was passed in the state granting same-sex couples benefits of marriage in the form of civil unions. Vermont became the third state after Hawaii and California to offer legal status to same-sex couples and the first to offer a civil union status. Then on 8 February 2007 a bill was introduced to allow gay marriage for same-sex couples and on 1 September 2009 same-sex marriage became legal in Vermont. As of 2012, Vermont is considered the least religious state in the US. Only 33% of the population consider themselves religious with the majority identifying as Catholic (21%). Vermont is known as a liberal state and is regarded as one of the most LBGT-friendly states in the US. Same-sex couples from all over the country travel to Vermont in order to be married, although their marriage may not be recognised in their home state. The state has won several accolades and awards for being one of the most healthiest, peaceful and happiest states in the country. The locals are also very proud of their vast green mountainous landscape and their leading export, maple syrup, which brings in tourists from all over the world. English is the primary language spoken in Vermont with over 90% of the population speaking only English. 6% of the population speaks a language other than English with French being the majority.","Sunny and warm summers, followed by cold winters with abundant snowfall.

During the 16th century the Spanish made several expeditions with Spanish Jesuits setting up the Ajacán Mission, the first colony in the area. However, this was destroyed after a revolt. Next came the English, who between 1584 and 1587 tried established the Roanoke Colony, their first in the New World. Consisting of two groups, sponsored by Sir Walter Raleigh, the attempt at permanent settlement failed. The final group disappeared completely after awaiting supplies from England for three years. Because there is no evidence of where they went or how they disappeared, they are known as ‘The Lost Colony. In 1607 Jamestown (named for King James I) was established as the first permanent English settlement, and despite initial struggles, the introduction of new types of tobacco which were better quality than the local variety, soon meant Virginia’s economy thrived on the new cash crop. After almost two decades of the colony being run as a private enterprise by the Virginia Company, Virginia became a royal colony in 1624. Tobacco was to be the driving force of the economy until well into the 18th century. On 15 May 1776 the Fifth Virginia Convention declared Virginia a free and independent state. After the victory of the Revolutionary War, Virginia prospered as export markets in Europe reopened for its tobacco. The state wielded strong influence throughout the nation, evidenced by the fact that four of the first five presidents of the US were Virginians. During the Civil War, Virginia decided to secede from the Union and join the Confederate States in 1861 and was rewarded by moving its capital from Montgomery, Alabama to Richmond. The western counties of Virginia, however, did not side with the Confederacy and broke away, renaming themselves the Union state of Virginia. In 1863, Congress approved for West Virginia to become the 35th state. Several battles were fought in Virginia for the remainder of the Civil War including Seven Days Battles, the Battle of Fredericksburg, and the Battle of the Wilderness. In 1865, Virginia returned to union control after Richmond was burned down by a retreating Confederate army. The complete devastation caused by the Civil War led President Andrew Johnson to institute a plan for reconstruction of the state, overhauling infrastructure and legislature. During this time, Virginia passed the Black Codes, which severely restricted Freedmen’s rights, ratified the 13th amendment to abolish slavery and revoked the 1868 ordinance of secession. In the late 19th century and early 20th century, Virginia went through several reforms designed to modernize the state, increase efficiency, and promote education and eliminate waste and correction. During the Cold War, Virginia saw new growth and prosperity as Federal government agencies were built in Virginia and new higher education institutions were founded. Virginia today has a diversified economy, with technology, public sector and agriculture the main sources of income, and one of the lowest rates of  unemployment in the US. During the Civil Rights movement of the 60s, Virginia resisted federal court orders requiring the end of segregation and drew out a package of laws known as the Stanley plan to try to evade racial integration in public schools. It eventually relented to US Supreme Court rulings. More recently, Virginia was a target of the 9/11 attacks when a hijacked plane crashed into the Pentagon, killing 189 people.  Virginia is predominantly Christian and Protestant with Baptist being the single largest group with 27% of the population. Around 4% of the population are affiliated with other religions and 18% are unaffiliated. Because the state is sandwiched between the South and the North, it can be varied in culture and while regions like Piedmont have a strong Southern culture, urban cities like Richmond have a more alternative culture. Virginia is proud of its rich history and Colonial Williamsburg is a whole town dedicated to reliving its colonial history. English is the primary language spoken in Virginia. Like most other US states, Spanish is also widely spoken with around 5% speaking the language.","Virginia's climate is humid, sub-tropical, enjoying pleasantly hot summers and relatively mild but crisp winters, with moderate rainfall throughout the year. Average coastal temperatures in July and August rarely exceed 90°F (32°C), while in winter there is often snow. The mountainous areas in the west of the region provide welcome respite from the higher temperatures of summer. Warm winter clothes are needed in the coldest months. Light-to-medium weights are advised for the summer. Rainwear may be useful."

Wild beaches, verdant rainforests, snow-sprinkled volcanoes, bijous island retreats and the continent’s deepest river gorge all collide in the ‘Evergreen State’. Sure, it rains a lot, but whoever let a bit of precipitation get in the way of adventure? And there’s plenty of adventure to be found. Hike in Alpine meadows, trek through moss-covered forests and skip over driftwood on the Olympic Peninsula’s storm-pounded beaches. Climb a volcano at Mt Rainier or ski down one at Mt Baker. Kayak with orcas in the San Juan Islands, set sail at sunset in Puget Sound, go windsurfing on the Columbia River or hold onto your hat jetboating into Hells Canyon. For all its epic scenery though, the state’s star attraction is Seattle. The birthplace of grunge, the city is a laidback hub of creativity that entices travellers with its legendary live music scene, hip neighbourhoods and eclectic attractions. Learn guitar in a Frank Gehry-designed museum, shop for Scandi chic in historic Ballard, or figure out the password to drink cocktails in a speakeasy. South of Seattle, cross the fabulous Chihuly Bridge of Glass, a kaleidoscopic pedestrian overpass connecting the Museum of Glass to downtown Tacoma. If big-city thrills don’t do it for you, how about a Bavarian hamlet? Tucked into the Cascade Mountains, little Leavenworth risked losing everything when the local sawmill closed and the railroad was rerouted. So the good townsfolk decided to rebrand their village, and the result is a strangely compelling blend of Bavarian architecture, lederhosen-clad residents and Wienerschnitzel.

Washingtonians are known for being very polite and friendly, although its residents are sometimes seen as being quite reserved in comparison to the rest of the US. The state’s relatively progressive values and politics mean its residents are sometimes stereotyped as Birkenstock-wearing ecologically minded hippies; in reality, whilst people may have a greater degree of environment awareness – to the point wear cycling is a common mode of transport - this is not the case for everyone.

The self-styled ‘outdoor recreation capital of the East’ is shaking off any images of being a down-at-heel, coal-mining state, and has transformed itself into a giant natural playground, thanks to its forested hills, white-water rapids, underground caverns and powder-topped Appalachian Mountains. West Virginia offers a veritable A to Z of adrenaline adventures, from all-terrain vehicle rides along one of the world’s largest off-road courses to zip-lining through gorges at night. The Monongahela National Forest sprawls across the state’s highest peaks and is dotted with campgrounds and log cabins, which fill up in summer with hikers, mountain bikers, anglers and horse riders. If these activities all sound a bit tame, swing your climbing harness and ropes over to Seneca Rocks, a craggy quartzite outcrop jutting 270m (900ft) above the North Fork River. Also guaranteed to get the heart pumping a little faster is a rafting trip down the Gauley River, known as the ‘Beast of the East’ owing to its preponderance of Class IV and V rapids. Prefer to watch others doing crazy stunts? Head on down to the annual Bridge Day at New River Gorge, when base jumpers fling themselves off a 267m (876ft) bridge.

Charleston.","The history of West Virginia can be traced back to 10,500 BC when Paleo-Indians resided along the major river valleys. For most of the 17th century, West Virginia served as a passing ground for explorers and fur traders. But because the region was cut off by rugged mountains, it remained uninhabited until the mid 18th century when German families established a settlement on the Potomac, now known as Shepherdstown, the oldest town in the state.  The population of the state boomed during the early 19th century with the Louisiana Purchase in 1803 and the completion of the National Road at Wheeling in 1818. But as population grew, the more it became estranged from the wealthier, eastern part of the state. When Virginia seceded from the Union during the Civil War in 1861, the northwestern counties of Virginia strongly opposed the secession and since they were unable to stop the state from seceding, the counties took the opportunity to separate from Virginia completely. On 20 June, 1863 President Lincoln declared the area of West Virginia its own state, the 35th in the Union.  In the late 19th century, West Virginia’s economy changed severely from a largely self-sufficient community to one dependent on industry profits and labour wages. During WWI and WWII, industry boomed in the mines and steel mills. But soon problems arose between the workers and unions and strikes were widespread during the latter part of the 19th century and the mid 20th century.  The Great Depression of 1930 intensified problems in the state as many labour workers fell victim to poverty, caused by low wages and unemployment. When reform measures under the New Deal were established, miners were assured the right to organize, and membership in the labour union United Mine Workers of America soared as labour leaders now had strong political power in the state. During the 1950s, economic weakness in the coal industry caused the state’s economy to decline and the unemployment rate soared. In the 1960s, the economy started to improve as federal aid poured into the state in an effort to attract new industry. Over the years, West Virginia’s chief industry has been a major political issue and has been attributed to much of the state’s unemployment rate as the industry’s economy fluctuates. 36% of the population is affiliated with a religion, with the majority of those being Protestant. The mining culture is still very prominent in the state and is honoured throughout with coal exhibitions. Civil War re-enactments are also very popular, as many visitors come to see period battles brought to life. Blue grass music is a big part of the West Virginia culture and is celebrated year-round in local music festivals. A majority of the state speak only English, and only a small minority speak a language other than English, with Spanish being the most frequent of these.","West Virginia enjoys pleasantly hot, humid summers and relatively mild but crisp winters, with moderate rainfall throughout the year.

Up until European settlement began in the mid-17th century, several native tribes called the land home, amongst them the Ioway, Ho-Chunk and the Menominee. The French were the first Europeans to make it to Wisconsin, with Jean Nicolet probably being the first.  Nicolet canoed the Great Lakes in 1634 and presumably came ashore near Green Bay. The fur trade was quickly established with the local tribes, making no permanent residences. During the French and Indian War in 1763, the British gained control of the region, but the French fur traders continued their work in the region, and eventually settled permanently in the area. Though technically in the US’s possession after the American Revolutionary War, the British kept control until after the War of 1812, when an American presence was finally established in the territory. Under US control, the economy shifted from fur trading to lead mining which brought a surge of immigration at the prospect of easy wealth.  The hovels used by the miners brought about the nickname ‘badgers’ which is Wisconsin’s state animal to this day. The influx of settlers increased tension with the native peoples, resulting in the Winnebago War of 1827 and leading to the forced removal of American Indians. The Wisconsin Territory was defined in 1836 and as more whites settled in the territory, it became the 30th territory to be granted statehood was granted in 1848. During the 19th century, the state started to move away from lead mining and instead focus on agriculture. Along with the lumber industry, this had dire ecological effects.  To combat the decline of the land, in 1890, many farmers switched to dairy production and the cheese production industry that characterises Wisconsin today was born. In the early 20th century Wisconsin was re-forested and the promotion of recreational tourism began. The 20th century also brought on progressive politics, which led Wisconsin to create a comprehensive state-wide primary election system, workplace injury compensation law and the first state income tax.  The birthplace of the Republican Party and a fierce anti-slavery state, Wisconsin is now a swing state, and is able to tip the scales in a Presidential election. True to its beginnings as a political state, Wisconsin took part in the anti-communist brigades of Senator Joseph McCarthy in the 1950s and the anti-war fervour of the 1970s that led to the Sterling Hall bombing. In the 1990s, welfare reform took precedence for the government and the close of the 20th century saw a change from industry and manufacturing to a service economy of medicine, education, agribusiness and tourism. Christianity makes up the majority of the religious population under a range of sects. Only 1% of the population claims other religions and 15% is unaffiliated. However, Wisconsin is home to the Circle Sanctuary, one of the largest Wiccan churches in the country. Wisconsin has a well known American football team, the Green Bay Packers, fans of which are often called ‘cheese heads’ and die-hards wear large foam wedges of cheese on their heads at the games to show support. The bar culture is alive, with a high bar to people ratio and a love of drinking; the state is also a major beer producer. There is a bitter rivalry with Illinois, in sports and politics alike. With forests and lakes galore, Wisconsinites are avid outdoors people and the state experiences all four seasons distinctly. The extreme wilderness adds to the attraction for tourists as well. Residents are known for being extremely nice and welcoming.  The main spoken language is English. Some Wisconsinites speak with a Canadian accent, frequently using ""eh"" at the end of their sentences and accentuating a long ""o"" sound. Around 3% of the population also speaks Spanish.","Summers are warm with cool nights. Winters are cold and snowy, especially around the Great Lakes where conditions can be severe. Winter temperatures of minus 40ºC (-40ºF) or lower are common in the north, and summer temperatures are often above 30ºC (90ºF) in the south of the state.

north-america,united-states-of-america,"With its vast national parks, bountiful fauna and rip-roaring Wild West heritage, the so-called Cowboy State is certainly worthy of a yee ha! Home to the smallest population of any US state, there’s plenty of room to roam in Wyoming. Wilderness abounds, particularly in the northwestern corner, where Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Parks throw up dazzling scenery and more wildlife than you can keep track of. Grizzlies, wolves and bison prowl Yellowstone, whose bubbling hot springs and spouting geysers are as thrilling to watch in winter as they are in summer. Immediately south of Yellowstone, Grand Teton is a mesmerising landscape of spiky peaks peering down at the Jackson Hole valley over a mile below. It’s an adventurer’s paradise, crammed with hiking trails, campgrounds, lakes for kayaking and jagged pinnacles begging to be climbed. The ultra-cool town of Jackson is a great base for both parks and a jumping-off point for skiing at Jackson Hole, where the snow runs steep and deep and green runs are for losers. Climbers also find it hard to resist tackling the corrugated rock faces of Devils Tower, a gigantic rocky monolith jutting up from the plains of northeastern Wyoming. If that sounds a bit scary, you can hunt for ancient stingray or herring at Fossil Butte in the southwest of the state, whose limestone layers conceal the world’s largest deposit of freshwater fish fossils.

Cheyenne.","It’s thought that Native Americans first settled in present-day Wyoming roughly 12,000 years ago, with artefacts associated with the Clovis, Folsom and Plano cultures having been discovered throughout the state. In 1807, John Colter, a member of the Lewis and Clark Expedition, was the first white American to explore the region. He described Yellowstone (which would be the world’s first National Park) as “Colter’s Hell” because of its steaming geysers and towering waterfalls. The US had acquired the region from the French as part of the Louisiana Purchase in 1803, but the western part of Wyoming, was not obtained until 1846, as part of the Oregon Treaty with Britain. By1867 the Union Pacific Railroad, which later became the largest railroad network in the US, had reached Wyoming. The site for the railroad was surveyed by General Grenville Dodge and named after one of the largest Native American tribes in the area, Cheyenne. The effect of the railroad was to boost the city’s population and wealth, leading it to become known as the “magic city of the plains” and eventually, Wyoming’s capital. The Wyoming Territory was established in 1869 but the state did not come into the union until March 27, 1890, when President Benjamin Harris signed the statehood bill and admitted Wyoming into the union as the 44th state. Wyoming is known as the “Equality State”, mainly due to its historical legacy of passing progressive laws that gave women further rights. In 1869 women were granted suffrage and Wyoming women became the first in the nation to obtain the right to vote. Wyoming also had the first justice of the peace in 1870, the first woman elected into state office in 1894, and the first woman governor in 1925. Yellowstone National Park, the world’s first, located primarily in Wyoming, was signed into law by President Ulysses S. Grant on March 1, 1872. The “Act of Dedication” bill which created the park was signed after advocate Ferdinand V. Hayden brought back a comprehensive report, including photographs and paintings of the area. Yellowstone is now known as a tourist landmark housing hundreds of species of fauna and flora, in which several are endangered. In 1906, President Theodore Roosevelt declared the first US national monument in Wyoming. Devils Tower, a naturally formed igneous intrusion of the land in northeastern Wyoming, stands 386m (1,267ft) in the air. The site is considered sacred by the Lakota and Sioux tribes and is the source of much Native American folklore in the area. Because of its parallel cracks, Devils Tower attracts roughly 4,000 visitors each year who attempt to climb it. The largest wildfire recorded in US history, lasting for around three months occurred in 1988 at Yellowstone. The fires engulfed over 400,000 hectares (1 million acres) of land, causing $6 million worth of damage. Efforts to stop its spread required the help of 9,000 firemen and cost the city $120 million. With 36% of the park  and 77 structures destroyed, a massive effort was funded by the US Congress to restore the damage and study its long-term effects. Today, the scorched land is slowly recovering and a new life cycle begins amongst the blackened canopy. Most of the population in Wyoming is Christian with a great majority being Protestant. A very small percentage of the population identify with other religions or are non-religious. Wyoming is known as a conservative state and still holds many of the culture and values of the American West, in high regard. Rodeos and festivals celebrating the western culture are very popular in the state. The world-famous Frontier Days rodeo has been held in Cheyenne since 1897. The official language of Wyoming is English with over 90% speaking only English and less than 10% speaking another language. The people of Wyoming speak with a Midwestern American accent.","Generally cold, semi-arid climate. Summers are short and hot while winters are cold and relatively long.

Fill your RV with supplies, chuck in a couple of spare tyres and drive Canada’s only all-weather road, the Dempster Highway, from Dawson City north across the Arctic Circle to Inuvik, in the Northwest Territories. Or follow the Silver Trail from Whitehorse through moose habitat to the historic mining towns of Mayo and Keno. Whichever route you pick, seeing more wildlife than humans is pretty much guaranteed. There are twice as many moose as there are people, and caribou, grizzlies and elk all make regular roadside appearances. As for the few who do live here, the Yukon First Nations have been here the longest, and you can learn about their roots at aboriginal cultural centres, art studios, or the Adäka Cultural Festival, a cracking summer celebration on Whitehorse’s waterfront.

oceania,american-samoa,"American Samoa is a tropical island paradise at the heart of Polynesia. Perhaps the most beautiful part of this so-called sub-region, which is made up of hundreds of tiny islands, American Samoa consists of seven freckles of land. And glorious nuggets of land they are, complete with volcanic backdrops, tropical forests and wildlife-rich woodlands. If you're wondering about the name, American Samoa belongs to the US, but is not a part of it. They harbour a couple of the Manu'a group of islands, too, which are volcanic in origin and dominated by high peaks. American Samoa's volcanoes, inactive since 1911, have left an intriguing land formation, including cavernous lava tubes. The stunning uniqueness of the landscape is why American Samoa has such a reputation for being photogenic. Of course, it's the deep-blue sea and immaculate beaches that attract many visitors. One of the most famous spots in American Samoa is Pago Pago on the main island of Tutuila. Still holding on to its roots as an old fishing town, its natural harbour is one of the most spectacular in the world. In fact, you'll find no shortage of idyllic villages in clinging on to the old ways on these islands. Most people live in villages along the narrow coastal plains, living off the fruits of the sea, and cultivating agriculture on the plains and nearby hills. Traditional Samoan society is based on a chieftain system of hereditary rank, and is known as the Samoan way or Fa'a Samoa. Despite the inroads of modern, Western civilisation, local cultural institutions remain the strongest single influence in American Samoan life. If hiking is your thing, you won't be disappointed, with breath-taking trails traversing the National Park of American Samoa. In fact there are many opportunities for adventure tourism here. So whether you decide to stick to the beaches or go trekking across the jagged landscapes, you'll feel as if you've landed in some forgotten paradise. 201 sq km (77.6 sq miles). 55,602 (UN estimate 2016). 270.3 per sq km.

Man has lived there for some 3500 years, although contact with Europeans only goes back around 300 years – a Dutchman called Jacob Roggeveen is thought to have been the first to have recorded them in 1722. Some 50 years later the French explorer Louis-Antoine de Bourgainville named them the Navigator Islands and English traders and missionaries started to arrive soon after. The writer Robert Lois Stevenson visited on 25 March 1891, as did W Somerset Maugham on 15 December 1916. Early contact with locals did not always go well and a particularly ferocious skirmish between islanders and French settlers on Tutuila, the largest island of modern American Samao, earned the Samoans a reputation for ferocity and the site the name of Massacre Bay. By the dawn of the 20th century the islands had been split between Germany and the United States – the eastern group being known as the Tutuila Islands in 1900, Manu’a in 1904, then the US Naval Station Tutuila and, since 1911, American Samoa. Towards the end of World War 1 an influenza pandemic swept the world and quick thinking Governor John Martin Poyer quarantined the territory. American Samoa, with New Caledonia and Brazil’s Marajó island, was one of only three places on Earth where no influenza deaths occurred. Poyer was awarded the Navy Cross. During World War 2 US Marines stationed in American Samoa considerably outnumbered the local population. After the war a move to incorporate the territory was defeated due largely to the efforts of Tuiasosopo Mariota and the tribal chiefs. In 1949 the American Samoa Fono, a territorial legislature was founded and continues to meet in the village of Fagatogo, the official seat of government. American Samoa’s government is divided into three branches. The Governor leads the executive and the legislative branch is led by the Fono, which consists of the House of Representatives elected by popular vote and the Senate represented by the village matai. The judicial branch is part of the US judicial system. American Samoa has a non-voting representative elected to the US Congress. Did you know? • American Samoa has a higher rate of military enlistment than any other US state or territory. • The popular Samoan song Fa’afofoga Samoa is thought to have been based on the final words of Imoa, the last man to have been executed on American Samoa, on 24 November 1939. • In the early 1970s American astronauts returned to Earth a few hundred miles from Pago Pago and were brought to the islands on their way back to the US mainland. Half of the population are Christian Congregational. There are also Roman Catholics, Latter Day Saints and Protestants, among others. Traditional Samoan society is still bound by very strict customs and, despite the younger generation's dissatisfaction with the old values, they are very much adhered to. The government issues an official list of behaviour codes for both Samoas. Skimpy shorts or other revealing clothes should be avoided except when swimming or climbing coconut palms, although disapproval of shorts, if they are not too short, is on the wane. Samoan social behaviour conforms to strict and rather complicated rituals, to which the visitor will probably be introduced on arrival, and which should be respected. In the early evening hours, even if swimming offshore, be sure to avoid making any noise that could interrupt the Samoans' prayer period. Usually three gongs are sounded. The first is the signal to return to the house, the second is for prayer and the third sounds the all-clear. In some villages, swimming and fishing are forbidden on Sunday. A visitor who happens to be invited to stay in a Samoan household should be mindful of American Samoan customs. On leaving, making a gift, a mea alofa (literally a 'thing of love') of shirts, belts or dress-length fabrics is most appreciated. Samoans are extremely hospitable and visitors may receive more than one invitation to stay with neighbours. However, it is inappropriate to leave your first hosts before a pre-arranged date. Samoan, but many islanders speak English.","Very warm, tropical climate. The heaviest rainfalls are usually between December and April.

Rose and Swain's Islands are uninhabited coral atolls, located to the east and north, respectively, of the other two island groups."
oceania,australia,"Australia is a land of savage beauty, big adventure and even bigger horizons. There are good reasons why the country finds itself touted as one of the ultimate travel getaways; it has personality in spades, landscapes to die for and more than its fair share of sunshine. And if beaches, rainforest and outback aren’t your thing, then its major cities are outstanding destinations in their own right. In many ways the country breeds extremes. The fiery atmosphere of an Aussie Rules match in Melbourne and the champagne glitz of Sydney Harbour belong to another planet entirely when compared to the quiet expanse of the Red Centre or the surf-bashed coastlines of the west. Likewise, 40,000 years of Aboriginal culture sometimes seem an unnatural bedfellow for the famed “no worries mate” BBQ-lifestyle of modern times. When taken as a whole, however, the sum of Australia’s contrasts make it a destination that is as fascinating as it is diverse. Knowing where to go is arguably the toughest part. There are well-travelled paths, with Sydney and the east coast being a perennially popular choice. When you’re faced with a country of this magnitude, however, potential itineraries are numberless. The Great Barrier Reef? Uluru? The Great Ocean Road? Kakadu? Hobart? The Kimberley? When the tourist board controversially coined the slogan “So where the bloody hell are you?” it raised a fair point. There are iconic Aussie clichés by the barrel-load (from cork hats to barbecues, koalas to crocodiles, and cricketers to bush tucker) but the real beauty of the place lies in the stuff you’re not expecting; the dusty open road that unfurls to reveal verdant hills; the cold beer at an outback pub that turns into an evening-long session; the stroll to the beach that throws up a street market, open-air concert and implausibly beautiful sunset.

It was Captain James Cook, however, who landed at Botany Bay in 1770 and changed the fate of the land forever. When he and his men stepped onto Australian shores, they encountered an Aboriginal way of life that went back some 40,000 years. The first governor, Arthur Phillip, was ordered to encourage a positive relationship with the indigenous locals, although a mixture of disease, malice and mutual suspicion meant this was over-optimistic. The first settlers treated the Aboriginal population with appalling brutality, which gave way to racist policies from subsequent administrations. Tensions still exist between mainstream Australia and the guardians of the Aboriginal way of life. While the native way of life was being strained, the island’s new settlers were putting down firm roots. A British colony had been established not long after Cook’s arrival, and by 1868 (recognising the powerful crime deterrent afforded by penal transportation) London had sent more than 160,000 convicts to Australia. By this time there had also been the mass arrival of free settlers and speculators, many of them pouring into the country in the gold rush of the 1850s. It led to significant economic expansion. By the 1880s the majority of people in the colony had been born and raised in Australia, which in turn was creating a deeper sense of nationalism. The Commonwealth of Australia came into being in 1901. The nation was deeply involved and affected by both world wars and the Great Depression, but it continued to develop into a modern, versatile nation and grew as both a domestic and international power. Racial reconciliation was given a boost in 2008 when government issued a formal apology to the indigenous population for the past. Australia remains a constitutional monarchy, with Queen Elizabeth II as its present monarch. The country saw its first ever female prime minister in 2010, when Labor’s Julia Gillard won a narrow election victory. Her rule lasted three years, before a political merry-go-round then saw Labor’s Kevin Rudd, the Liberal Party’s Tony Abbott and current prime minister Malcolm Turnbull all have stints in power before 2015 was up. Turnbull, of the Liberal Party, is currently serving as Prime Minister, having been re-elected in 2016.

There are two climatic zones: the tropical zone (in the north above the Tropic of Capricorn) and the temperate zone. The tropical zone (consisting of 40% of Australia) has two seasons, summer ('wet') and winter ('dry'), while the temperate zone has all four seasons. Spring to summer (October to March): Warm or hot everywhere, tropical in the north, and warm to hot with mild nights in the south. This is the classic tourist season, with northern hemisphere visitors looking to escape winter temperatures and soak up some Antipodean sunshine, although Australia is essentially a year-round destination. Autumn to winter (April to September): Northern and central Australia have clear warm days and cool nights; the south has cool days with occasional rain but still plenty of sun. Snow is totally confined to mountainous regions of the southeast. At certain times, the southern part of the mainland (as well as Tasmania) can become seriously chilly, so be prepared to wrap up. Drought is becoming more widespread with southeast Queensland, Victoria and South Australia all badly affected. Lightweights during summer months with warmer clothes needed during the cooler winter period throughout most of the southern states. Lightweight cottons and linens all year in the central/northern states with warm clothes only for cooler winter evenings and early mornings. Sunglasses, sunhats and sunblock lotion are recommended year round in the north and during the summer months in the south. Should you arrive in the country without the appropriate clothing or equipment, however, it’s generally no problem to find high-quality items to purchase – there’s no danger of being left to choose from a substandard selection. Australia's great coastline covers 59,736km (37,119 miles); the country is lapped by the Arafura and Timor Seas to the north, the Coral and Tasman Seas of the South Pacific to the east, the Southern Ocean to the south, and the Indian Ocean to the west. Most of the population has settled along the eastern and southeastern coastal strip, with the notable exception of Perth, one of the most remote cities in the world, on the west coast. Australia is the smallest continent (and the largest island) in the world, and terrain ranges from baking red desert to lush green rainforest, and from world-renowned surfing beaches to snow-clad mountains.  It’s partly the extreme diversity of different landscapes that makes Australia such a great travel proposition, in fact – there aren’t many countries that can offer natural features as richly eclectic as Uluru, the Great Ocean Road and the Great Barrier Reef. In the east lies the Great Dividing Range; there are rainforests in the far northeast (mainly in Queensland); the southeast is a huge fertile plain; and further to the north lays the enormous Great Barrier Reef: a 2,000km (1,200-mile) strip of coral that covers a total area of 345,000 sq km (133,000 sq miles)."
oceania,australia,"It might be a mere crumb of land on the map, but the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) – as its grand name suggests – gives home to Canberra, the nation's pristine capital. Rarely seen as a standalone travel destination, the city itself retains its own distinct atmosphere, having evolved from a quiet bush-land home for bureaucrats and politicians to a modern and vibrant hub, offering stunning cuisine, strong arts venues and an active student population. As befitting its status, the city is filled with cultural experiences, including world-renowned museums and galleries. Highlights for Canberra visitors include the National Gallery, the Australian War Memorial and Questacon, the national science and technology centre. You’ll also find some great places to try the cool-climate wines that the ACT is becoming known for. Canberra accounts for a healthy swathe of the ACT, but the territory also finds space to accommodate the natural beauty of the Namadgi National Park. In the summer, the park offers a spectacular array of bushwalks that meander through its lush flora and fauna. In the winter the Bimberi and Brindabella Ranges receive a dusting of picturesque snow. Incongruously, perhaps, other local attractions include the large satellite dishes at the Canberra Deep Space Communication Complex, which is set in foothills southwest of the city. They’re still used to provide two-way support for spacecraft in orbit and are one of only three such systems in the world.

The first European to arrive in the area was Charles Throsby in 1821, and around three years later the first permanent settlers arrived. By the 1830s, most of the region was inhabited by Europeans. The Aboriginal population reduced significantly over the rest of the century, mainly due to diseases and predations. After the Federation of Australia in 1901, a suitable capital was sought. It was determined that the capital would be in the Yass-Canberra region and a competition for the design of the new city was held. American architect Walter Burley Griffin’s design of a garden city with an ornamental lake won first prize, and the foundation stone was laid in 1913. Building works moved slow and were interrupted by World War I, the Great Depression of the 1930s and World War II. In an attempt to speed things along, the National Capital Development Commission was established in 1958 and took control over the planning, development and construction of the capital. The population in the region grew rapidly over the next 20 years, and although self-governance was opposed by the majority of the Australian Capital Territory residents, it was granted in 1988.

The summer months, December-February, are the hottest with dry days and nights. Temperatures can average 28° Celsius during this time with January being the hottest month. Autumn and winter are suitable alternatives for visitors, with beautiful autumn colour erupting in Canberra’s leafy suburbs and parks. During the winter, June – August, temperatures can plummet to between 1-12° Celsius, and nearby slopes in the Snowy Mountains receive a good amount of snow. Bring lightweights during summer months, and warmer medium-weight clothes are necessary for winter. Sunscreen is a must during the hottest periods of the year. Waterproofing is advisable throughout the year, especially in winter. A coat is necessary during winter months. The Australian Capital Territory is found on the western slopes of the Great Dividing Range, with spectacular green countryside surrounded by mountains. Canberra is situated in the northeast corner of ACT whilst further south the Namadgi National Park, with its forests, rivers and waterholes, accounts for 46% of the territory. It is not uncommon for snow to make an appearance here across the ranges during the winter months, although summer can see temperatures reach 40ºC (104ºF). Lake Burley Griffin, a manmade lake, is the centrepiece of this constantly expanding modern capital.

The name Cook Islands actually originates from a Russian naval chart produced in the 1820s. However, credit for the discovery of the 15 islands and two reefs that make up the modern country must go to the Polynesians, who came across them during their great migratory journeys over the Pacific in the seventh and eighth centuries. Mutineers from HMS Bounty are thought to have rediscovered the main island Rarotonga in 1789, although the first recorded landing by Europeans was in 1814. It didn’t go well and sailors fought a bloody action with Islanders that left many dead on both sides. A return party seven years later was more peacefully received and Christianity soon spread. In 1888 the Cook Islands became a British protectorate and in 1900 were annexed and declared part of Her Britanic Majesty’s dominions. In 1901 the Islands were included within the boundaries of New Zealand. In 1949 the Islanders were British subjects granted New Zealand citizenship and in 1965, the Cook Islands achieved self-government as a New Zealand Dependency. There are no plans and little pressure to change this status. Executive power is formally held by the New Zealand High Commissioner, but is effectively devolved to the cabinet. The House of Ariki, which is composed of all the paramount chiefs of the Cook Islands, serves as an advisory body. Advice is given on legislation concerning customs and traditions, though the House of Ariki has no powers of legislation itself. New Zealand is responsible for defence and foreign affairs. Cook Islanders are citizens of New Zealand, but identified as Cook Islands nationals, a status not enjoyed by other New Zealand citizens. Although tourism is a mainstay of the local economy, with around 100,000 visitors a year, other sectors include offshore banking – the Islands specialise in controversial asset protection trusts that allow investors to shelter assets from creditors – as well as pearls, marine and fruit exports. Did you know? Mainly Cook Islands Christian Church (58%); also Roman Catholic, Latter Day Saints, Seventh Day Adventists and Assembly of God. Dress code is informal, though modest attire should be worn when visiting towns or villages. Women are expected to wear dresses for church services and social functions. The official languages are English and Cook Islands Maori.","Weather can be quite changeable from day to day and varies throughout the islands. It is generally hot throughout the year, although the trade winds provide some moderating influence. Rainfall is heaviest in Rarotonga, while the northern atolls tend to be drier. The coolest months are June to August, while November to March marks the warmer season, which also has the highest rainfall. Lightweight cottons and linens throughout the year. Warmer clothes are advised for the evenings. The Cook Islands are situated 3,500km (2,200 miles) northeast of New Zealand and 1,000km (600 miles) southwest of Tahiti in the South Pacific, forming part of Polynesia. The 15 islands fall into two groups: the scattered Northern Group are all coral atolls while the Southern Group is of volcanic origin. Most of the larger islands include lagoons surrounded by small areas of fertile land above which rise volcanic hills. Rarotonga is the largest and highest island with a rugged volcanic interior, its highest peak being Te Manga, at 652m (2,140ft). Coral reef surrounds the island and the population lives between reef and hills where rich soil supports both tropical and subtropical vegetation. Most of the island is covered by thick evergreen bush. Most of the larger islands include lagoons surrounded by small areas of fertile land, above which rise volcanic hills. The best beaches in the Cook Islands are found on Aitutaki, which is part of the eight-island Southern Group. The Northern Group comprises seven islands, the largest being Penrhyn, Manihiki and Pukapuka."
oceania,pacific-islands-of-micronesia,"Scattered across the Pacific Ocean, the Federated States of Micronesia is the epitome of paradise – with its powdery shores, crystalline waters and colourful coral reefs – but its lack of connectivity and relative obscurity means few travellers actually make it here. Comprised of some 607 islands, this archipelago is not the easiest place to get to, but it certainly rewards those who do make the journey. In islands like Chuuk, visitors will find vast lagoons of monumental beauty, filled with shipwrecks, kaleidoscopic corals and sandy beaches. The islands are a dream for divers, and many argue that the area’s diving and snorkelling ranks among the best in the world. It’s not all about natural beauty, though. The Micronesians themselves combine a profusion of languages, customs and folklore, which are captivating to witness. The archipelago is defiantly archaic too, which is wholly refreshing: on the island of Yap, islanders still trade using an ancient stone currency. Some Micronesians can also be glimpsed wearing traditional garments and throughout the nation you are likely to stumble across snatches of unique island music and witness zesty, time-honoured dances. Though a sovereign nation now, the archipelago has been dragged from pillar to post by various colonial powers. The Portuguese, Spanish, Germans and Japanese have all laid claim to the territory, followed by the USA, which took over the administration the nation in 1947. However, in 1986, the Federated States signed a Compact of Free Association with the USA, allowing for independence with US defence support. The islands suffer from remoteness and lack of industry and infrastructure. There is development potential, but as yet Micronesia remains dependent on US aid. Tourism is one industry that could potentially boost the island's fiscal situation. However, even if tourism does take off, with 607 islands to speak of, finding some deserted shores to relax on shouldn't be too hard. 702 sq km (271 sq miles). 104,966 (UN estimate 2016). 149.9 per sq km.

This followed successive colonisation by the Portuguese, Spanish and Germans, and latterly Japanese rule between the two World Wars, under a mandate from the League of Nations (a forerunner of the United Nations). In November 1986, the Federated States signed a Compact of Free Association with the USA, allowing for near-independence with US defence support. Admission to and support from the South Pacific Forum an association that groups Australasia with the smaller Pacific island nations has been particularly valuable. Other than political matters, successive governments including the present administration of Premier Leo Falcam, elected in 1999 have been pre-occupied with the economic situation, as the Federated States suffer from remoteness and lack of industry and infrastructure. There is some development potential, particularly in the fishing and fish-processing industry, but Micronesia has some way to go before it ceases to be dependent on aid from the USA, which amounted to US$1.3 billion between 1986 and the end of the last century. In 1991, the Federated States of Micronesia were admitted to the UN. Mostly Roman Catholic (50%), Protestant (47%) and other Christian denominations (3%). There are considerable variations of custom and belief. Approximately 95% of Kosreans are Congregationalists with a deeply held respect for Sunday as a day of rest. Pre-European influences are stronger elsewhere and nowhere more so than in Yap where visitors are only allowed with prior permission. Use of islands, paths, beaches etc may also require permission in many areas; it is best to check beforehand.Photography: Permission should always be sought. Though people are friendly, and usually accommodating, not to seek prior permission before taking pictures is considered an insult, especially on some of the more remote islands.

oceania,fiji,"A friendly Fijian welcome and broad smiles await you in this tropical paradise of beautiful beaches, glowing blue lagoons and swaying palm trees. Renowned for stunning sunsets, breathtaking waterfalls, awesome surf and pristine rainforests, Fiji unsurprisingly draws thousands of visitors to its shores each year. Chief among the attractions has to be the cyan-blue sea. As you enter the Fijian airspace you will no doubt be greeted with a carpet of glistening turquoise reefs, fringing unspoilt confetti of sandy, lush islands. It may look tranquil and majestic, but beneath the surface it's teeming with life. Amid multicoloured reefs, the intrepid can explore over 1,000 fish species. You'll also find five of the seven species of sea turtle as well as sharks, dolphins and whales around Fiji. You can't come here without snorkelling or diving at least some of the time. Beyond the marine life, you'll find ample opportunities to go hiking, with an abundance of forests and trails following scenic view points and waterfall pools. Nature lovers will revel on the island of Kadavu, which is practically roadless, with a smattering of local villages and plantations connected by untrodden pathways. Even more beauty can be found on the verdant island of Taveuni which boasts thick jungle vegetation and tropical flowers. Birdwatchers will love the Fijian islands for its plethora of winged species including the famous yellow and red-breasted musk parrots. Perhaps above all, though, it's the people that make Fiji. Comprising more than 300 islands, the country is a vibrant melting pot where East Indian, Polynesian, Melanesian, Chinese and European cultures converge to form a unique cultural medley. English is widely spoken, which means communication is a breeze. You can also expect locals to give you the warmest welcomes, and don't be surprised if they invite you into their homes and invite you to share a cup of Kava. If, somehow, you tire of the beaches and wildlife of the islands, you'll find Suva to be an intriguing cultural hub, with a jumble of colonial and modern architecture. Laid out over lush hills by the sea, the capital is home to half of the country's population and is the biggest city in the South Pacific. If you like to party, Fiji isn't all laid-back, with Suva offering up a large dose of irreverent nightlife. Brimming with colourful attractions, awe-inspiring scenery, friendly people and cultural and sporting activities aplenty, Fiji offers something for everyone. From the wanderlust-suffused traveller to the hedonistic sports junkie, this archipelago at the crossroads of the South Pacific is tourist heaven.

Prime Minister Sitiveni Rabuka since 2022.","Fiji has come a long way since the days of being referred to as the ‘Cannibal Isles’ by the European explorers who sailed their seas. Back then, mariners carefully avoided its shores because of its fierce warriors and treacherous waters. The first inhabitants came from Melanesia, some 3,500 years ago, and established a hierarchical society based on clans. Little is known of the islanders’ history before the arrival of Europeans in the mid-17th century. The establishment of plantations destabilised the economy resulting in serious friction between the Fijians and Europeans. In 1874, Fiji became a British colony. Large numbers of workers from India were imported to develop a plantation economy, accounting for the islands’ present ethnic mix. After gaining independence in 1970, the moderate conservative Alliance Party governed without interruption. However, Fiji’s political situation was to be anything but stable, with friction between ethnic Fijians and Indo-Fijians dominating politics over the last few decades and resulting in several military coups over the last 30 years. In 1987, a republic was declared following a coup and after another in 2006 Fiji’s then-president, President Ratu Josefa Iloilo suspended the constitution and appointed himself head of state in early 2009. Later that year, Fiji’s failure to hold democratic elections saw the country become the first nation to be expelled from the Pacific Islands Forum; a few months later, Fiji was suspended from the Commonwealth of Nations because Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama refused to hold elections by 2010. After years of delays a new Constitution was enacted and elections were finally held in September 2014 with Bainimarama’s FijiFirst party winning a resounding victory with 59.2 per cent of the vote as Fiji was re-admitted to the Commonwealth as well as the Pacific Islands Forum. Perhaps not surprisingly Fiji has relatively large armed forces – almost 4,000 active soldiers and sailors with a further 6,000 reservists – and has contributed to several UN peacekeeping missions. Did you know? • Before 2012, the traditional Cibi war dance was performed by the Fijian national rugby team before each match. After it was decided the Cibi was a celebration of victory it was replaced by the new Bole war cry – an acceptance of a challenge. • Fiji has an estimated 333 islands, 110 of which are permanently inhabited. Fiji also has over 500 islets. • The Meke dance is an indigenous art form and usually incorporates men’s and the women’s dances to mark an important event. Some Mekes are generations old. Methodist and Hindu with Roman Catholic and Muslim minorities. The 1997 Constitution of Fiji guarantees freedom of religion. Fijians are a very welcoming people and visitors often experience local hospitality. Informal casual wear is generally acceptable. Tips for visiting villages: Before visiting on your own, it is customary to purchase a bundle of unpounded yaqona (kava root) - the traditional sevusevu (gift). When approaching the village, visitors should not enter immediately but wait until greeted. They will then be taken to the chief or turaga ni koro (headman), to whom the kava should be offered. Visitors who are accepted by the chief will be assigned a guide and host. Once inside the village, please also note the following: visitors should dress modestly and not wear shorts or hats, and women should not have their shoulders bare; shoes, hats and sunglasses should always be taken off when entering someone's house or any other village building; visitors should speak softly and not raise their voices too much as this may be interpreted as expressing anger; visitors should avoid touching someone’s head (children included) as it’s seen as insulting; visitors should show respect but be cautious about praise as Fijians will feel obliged to make a gift of an object if visitors show too much liking for it; Fijians will always, out of custom, ask visitors to stay or eat with them; visitors who spend a night in the village should reward their host with a useful gift of similar value for each member of the party; money is acceptable if it's offered as a goodbye sevusevu and not direct payment. The principal languages are Fijian and Fiji Hindi (known locally as Hindustani). English is widely spoken and is also taught in schools.","Fiji has a warm tropical climate perfect for beachside holidays. Maximum temperatures rarely move out of the 31°C (88°F) to 26°C (79°F) range all year round. Southeast trade winds from May to October bring dry weather and the rainy season runs from November to April. On average, there are 17 cyclones per decade with some causing severe damage. They typically occur from November to April but occasionally occur in October and May during El Niño years. There is more risk in the outlying northwest island groups. Fiji does have a wet season, which is characterised by heavy, brief local showers and contributes most of the country’s annual rainfall. The wet season is normally from November to April and results from the southerly movements of the South Pacific Convergence Zone. This is an excellent period for surfing, as tropical storms can bring some superb waves and shorter swells. It can, however, also bring strong winds and heavy tropical rain. Typically, the smaller islands in Fiji receive less rainfall than the main island with various amounts according to their location and size. The best months for holidaying regarding Fiji weather is late May through to early October. Note that this period is also the peak season for tourists. Lightweight for summer, rainwear for the wet season. Fiji is located in the South Pacific, over 3,000km (1,875 miles) east of Australia. It comprises 333 islands, 110 of which are inhabited (as well as over 500 islets). The three largest are Viti Levu (Great Fiji), Vanua Levu (Great Land of the People), both of which are extinct volcanoes rising abruptly from the sea, and Taveuni. There are thousands of streams and small rivers in Fiji, the longest being the Rewa River on Viti Levu, which is navigable for 128km (80 miles). Mt Tomanivi, also on Viti Levu, is the country's highest peak, at 1,324m (4,343ft)."
oceania,guam,"Guam is a vibrant, tropical paradise, complete with powdery beaches, and coral reefs teeming with underwater life. Away from the beach, find historic buildings in the bustling capital, Hagåtña, swinging nightlife in Tumon and a melting pot of Asian, European, Pacific Rim and American cultures. Those looking to get active can lace up those walking boots and climb Mount Lam Lam, or hop on a jet ski and whizz over the surrounding crystal clear waters. Guam is the largest and most southerly island of the Marianas Islands and has been an important US strategic base since World War II. The most populated island in Micronesia, this unincorporated US territory is full of American accents, and sadly the Chamorro language is less spoken today than it once was. Glamorous, modern Tumon Bay is where most of the hotels are, and it's pretty commercial with duty-free shopping being the order of the day. There is much more to Guam, though. It's a thoroughly multicultural island for one thing, and Chamorro culture is starting to be pushed more than it has been in recent decades. There are many pretty villages to explore, while a singular local cuisine is being celebrated more. If you leave Tumon Bay behind, you'll find Guam full of rustic settlements, with many immaculate, secluded beaches, and a few glorious waterfalls. Don't pass up opportunities to meet the locals on your travels, either, who are known for their charm and warmth towards visitors, and are increasingly passionate about making their traditional culture as prominent as it used to be. The US' somewhat overbearing presence in Guam is perhaps best typified by its military base, which dominates the north of the island. Even so, the area harbours a spectacular coastline of palm trees and turquoise waters, so don't miss it. 544 sq km (210 sq miles). 172,094 (UN estimate 2016). 297 per sq km. Hagåtña.

It was claimed by the Spanish in 1565 and ruled by Madrid until the Spanish-American War of 1898. The Spanish governor was unaware of the war and, when a US frigate entered Hagåtña harbour with guns blazing, he apologised to the captain for not having a reciprocal salute ready. He surrendered the island the next day. US rule was interrupted by the Japanese invasion of 1941, to be reinstated after fierce fighting three years later. The island has been an important US strategic base since then. Its facilities were provisionally earmarked for substantial expansion following the US withdrawal from the Philippines. However, the end of the Cold War and the overall retrenchment of the American military have forced the government of Guam to look to other means for its long-term future (see Business Profile). Politics on the island are based on the US system: the most recent gubernatorial election in November 2010 was won by the Republican Eddie Calvo. Christian; 85% Roman Catholic. Western customs are the norm, although one must also keep in mind the traditions of the Japanese who make up around 90% of the island's tourists. A native practice, the 'Eyebrow,' is unique: Islanders say hello, recognize someone or build a connection simply by lifting eyebrows and jerking their head back. English and Chamorro are the official languages. Japanese is also spoken - particularly by the older generation who were alive during the Japanese occupation.","Temperatures are pretty constant. Only on rare occasions does the temperature dip below 21.1°C (70°F) or above 32.2°C (90°F). Average humidity is 66% but easterly trade winds of 6.4k-19.3 kph (4-12 mph) offset the dampness. The wet season is July through November, with transitional months being June and December. The best time to visit is Jan-May, the dry season. Casual, lightweight attire is recommended for most times, but a rain jacket and an umbrella is always useful, especially during the rainy season. Shaped like a footprint, and surrounded by a coral shelf, Guam's northern end is a plateau of rolling hills and cliffs rising 152m (500ft) above sea level. The island narrows in the middle, and the expanding southern half undulates with mountains and valleys cut by streams and waterfalls. The most sheltered beaches are on the western coast."
oceania,kiribati,"White sandy beaches and crystal-clear lagoon waters characterise the Republic of Kiribati, which is made up of over 30 coral islands scattered across the Pacific. Kiribati is remote, and the tourism industry remains very much in its infancy – all the more reason to visit sooner rather than later. They may be relatively unknown, but the isles are peppered with swaying coconut palms, swathed in balmy breezes, and waters glistening in every direction. And so it's hard to feel anything other than intense holiday escapism. While lazing on desolate beaches is a huge draw, Kiribati does have an interesting population of both human and wildlife. Capital Tarawa is fast becoming one of the most densely populated areas in the Pacific, while Christmas Island, stretching for almost half the land mass of Kiribati, is carpeted with lakes and ponds great for game fishing, and boasts some of the largest colonies of birds. Other islands include Phoenix, Line and Gilbert – during British rule in the 19th and 20th centuries, Kiribati was known as the Gilbert Islands. In World War II, the islands were occupied by Japan, while in the post-war era the US and UK used Christmas island for nuclear weapons tests. The islands finally became independent in 1979. Despite Kiribati's colonial history, many of its islands have remained much the same as they've ever been. Locals live off breadfruit, fish and coconuts to this day. The inhabitants of the main island Tarawa also continue to live in raised thatched huts like their ancestors. You needn't fear a total separation from civilisation, however, as bars, cinemas, cars and the internet are increasingly a part of life in Kiribati. The people aren't unwelcoming, but you're more likely to be greeted by the children than adults, who tend to eye visitors cautiously. Once you break the ice, you'll find a fascinating culture, and plenty of glorious nature to explore.

Following European discovery, Kiribati came into contact with other Pacific islanders and the Chinese; traces of this intermixing remain in both the population and culture. Village government in Kiribati continues in the pre-colonial mode. In 1892, Kiribati became part of the British colony of the Gilbert and Ellice Islands, and was administered by the West Pacific High Commission in Fiji. The islands were occupied by the Japanese during World War II, and were the site of some of the fiercest fighting between Japan and the USA. The transition to independence began in 1963 with the formation of legislative and executive councils under the supervision of a British Governor General, who performed the functions previously exercised by the High Commissioner. The Legislative Council later evolved into the Maneaba ni Maungatabu (see Government section). In 1975, the Ellice Islands seceded from the main group to form the separate territory of Tuvalu. The remaining Gilbert Islands, along with a few smaller islands which the colonial authorities had tacked onto the group, became the independent republic of Kiribati in July 1979. Ieremia Tabai, a veteran of Kiribati politics, won the first three post-independence presidential elections, held in 1982, 1983 and 1987. Constitutional restraints prevented him from standing at the election held in late 1991, but he continued to exert considerable influence on the Government through his successor, former Vice President Teatao Teannaki, until the latter was turned out of office in September 1994. The victor, Teburoro Tito, was a member of the Maneaba Te Mauri (MTM), which had been in opposition to the dominant National Progressive Party (NPP), to which Tabai and Teannaki were both affiliated. Tito was re-elected at the election in November 1998. Simultaneous Maneaba elections returned the MTM as the largest bloc once again, although independents continued to hold the balance of power. The policy issues preoccupying Kiribati at present are economic and environmental. The weakness of the economy has led to what is widely seen as an over-dependence on foreign aid (see Business Profile section). The Government is also deeply concerned by the prospect of global warming as none of Kiribati's land lies more than 2m above sea level. A further issue, that of overpopulation, has been tackled by resettling several thousand people along with several hundred asylum seekers rejected by Australia on the relatively remote Line Islands and Phoenix Islands.

Kiribati (pronounced 'Kiribass', formerly the Gilbert Islands) consists of three groups in the central Pacific: Kiribati (including Banaba, formerly Ocean Island), the Line Islands and the Phoenix Islands. The 33 islands, scattered across 5 million sq km (2 million sq miles) of the central Pacific, are low-lying coral atolls with coastal lagoons. The exception is Banaba, which is a coral formation rising to 80m (265ft). The soil is generally poor, apart from Banaba, and rainfall is variable. Coconut palms and pandanus trees comprise the main vegetation. There are no hills or streams throughout the group. Water is obtained from storage tanks or wells."
oceania,pacific-islands-of-micronesia,"The Marshall Islands form a nation of scattered atolls and remote islands, which are known for their marine life and diving opportunities. Many of the atolls are dotted with Flame of the Forest, hibiscus and different-coloured plumeria flowers. There are also at least 160 species of coral surrounding the islands. The atolls are noted for their coconut and papaya plantations and for pandanus and breadfruit trees. The Marshallese are an interesting bunch. Apart from being a skilled seafaring people who know fishing and navigating as well as anyone, they're a thoroughly multicultural bunch. After two millennia of being isolated, the islands began to be settled and colonised from the 18th century by a wave of successive visitors and occupiers, from British and Russians, to Germans, Japanese and Americans. The most modern atolls bear the marks of all the above, with diverse restaurants and cuisine on offer. The capital of Majuro Atoll leans towards the Western, being relatively developed though still pretty laid-back. The real tropical wonders are the outer islands, which for the most part are immaculate freckles of paradise, though some have witnessed the horrors of nuclear testing. The Marshall Islands are undoubtedly a diving hotspot, with many enthusiasts skipping the capital altogether and heading for a spot of nature diving at Rongelap. Diving among wrecks from World War II is also popular, though perhaps the main diving attraction is Bikini Island. You may have heard of Bikini.

Republic in free association with the USA. President Hilda C. Heine since 2024.","The Marshall Islands were first sighted by European explorers, including Magellan, in the early 1500s. Portuguese and Spanish influences prevailed until the middle of the 19th century, when German trading interests brought the islands and its indigenous inhabitants under German colonial control. In 1914, upon the outbreak of World War I, the islands were occupied by the Japanese; their takeover was recognised in 1920, by a 'mandate to administer' issued by the League of Nations (forerunner of the United Nations). Several large military bases were built and Japan claimed the islands as a colony in 1938. The islands were then captured by US forces, during the course of the World War II Pacific campaign, in 1944. In 1947 the Marshall Islands were incorporated by the United Nations into its Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands and placed under US administration initially the US Navy, then from 1951, a civilian administration. Like the Japanese before them, the US used the islands as a strategic military base, training area and ultimately as a nuclear test site. Nuclear testing became a major political issue over the following decades. From the mid-1960s, the islanders became increasingly assertive, adopting the Congress for Micronesia as the main focus for debate and dissent. Note was elected again for a second term in November 2003. During the 1970s, the gradual process of dismantling the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands Palau, the Northern Marianas, the Federated States of Micronesia, and the Marshalls began, as internal self-government was granted and negotiations on full independence got underway. In 1983, the Marshall Islands assembly (the Nitijela) agreed the Compact of Free Association with the US government, which set down the terms under which the Marshall Islands would become a sovereign self-governing nation. The USA retained responsibility for the defence and security of the islands, also setting down guidelines for the conduct of the Marshalls' future foreign policy. US$30 million annual aid has been provided by Washington, in exchange for the continued use of existing military bases. (The original 15-year period covering that part of the agreement was extended. A new Compact came into force in September 2003). The Marshalls now belong to the South Pacific Forum, the main regional grouping, and in 1991 were admitted to the UN. Until his death in 1996, Amata Kabua who was elected to five consecutive terms as president from 1979 was the dominant political figure on the atoll after independence. The main issues facing successive governments have been the legacy of the nuclear testing and the state of the economy. Extensive nuclear testing, especially on the Kwajalein Atoll, has resulted in long-term damage to islanders' health and to the environment. The extent and nature of compensation and restitution in the form of environmental improvement and healthcare remain sore points in relations between the Marshalls and the USA. Following the death of Amata Kabua, his cousin, Imata Kabua, was elected as his successor in January 1997. Imata Kabua's government was undermined by allegations of corruption and following elections held at the end of 1999 he was replaced by Kessai Note, who leads a bloc associated with the United Democratic Party, although officially no political parties are represented in the Nitijela.

oceania,nauru,"If you’re travelling to Nauru, chances are you’re on business, ticking off every country in the world or visiting out of sheer curiosity – for this Pacific island is hardly your archetypal holiday destination. Although ringed by a beautiful coral reef, the island's interior has been ravaged by decades of phosphate mining, extracted to supply Australia with fertiliser. The sea is also subject to strong currents and rocky pinnacles jut up immediately offshore, meaning swimming and diving are limited. Tourism has never featured highly on Nauru's agenda, but there are a couple of dilapidated hotels and a handful of attractions: remnants of the Japanese WWII occupation, small beaches, a Chinatown of sorts and the lunar-like landscape of the mined centre. Buada Lagoon is worth checking out too, but swimming here isn’t recommended. You can also organise a deep-sea fishing charter and try your hand at hooking yellowfin tuna, marlin and wahoo. Nauru’s main road stretches 19km (12 miles) round the country, so it doesn’t take long to see everything, and the climate is stiflingly hot and humid, so flopping under a palm tree is about as much as you can usually manage anyway. This tiny island republic has gone from being one of the world’s richest nations (in terms of per capita income) to a country on the edge of economic ruin. When the phosphate began to run out, the economy took a downward turn. Consequently, Nauru has been forced to look to other means to keep the country afloat, most recently housing a controversial detention centre for Australia-bound asylum seekers in return for Australian aid. Nauru’s airline runs a regular service from Brisbane, locals are as upbeat as they can be about the future, and signs of vegetation are beginning to appear inland, but the chances of increasing numbers of intrepid travellers visiting look slim. 21 sq km (8 sq miles). 10,263 (UN estimate 2016). 454.3 per sq km. There is no capital. Government offices are in Yaren district. Republic. President David Adeang since 2023.","Nauru is one of the world's smallest and most remote sovereign states and was one of the many Pacific islands first settled centuries ago by Polynesian and Melanesian explorers. It was allocated to Germany under the 1887 Anglo-German Convention shortly before phosphate, the island's principal raw material, was discovered at the turn of the century. Nauru was captured by Australian forces in 1914 and continued under Australian rule (other than a period of Japanese occupation from 1942 to 1945) until independence was granted in 1968. A plan to evacuate the islanders in order to develop Nauru's remaining phosphate deposits precipitated the protest movement that eventually led to independence. Nauru sought compensation from the British, Australian and New Zealand governments, which led to the signing of a settlement in 1993. In common with other small island states, Nauru has attempted to develop an 'offshore' financial services industry to diversify its otherwise limited economy. This has led to problems with the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, which has been leading a campaign against international money-laundering. Nauru is one of seven nations which, in 2002, were 'named and shamed' by the OECD because of their failure to tackle the problem. In 2003, the Nauru government agreed to wind up the sector. A more unusual means of collecting revenue emerged in 2001 when Australia paid the Nauru government to take on 1,000 refugees, mostly from the Middle East, who had tried to enter Australia, in return for a significant amount of money. Another pressing issue for Nauru is the global environment, and especially global warming: as a low-lying island, its very existence may be threatened by a rise in sea levels.

If global warming causes sea levels to rise, the habitable low-lying land areas will be at risk from tidal surges and flooding. Lightweight cottons and linens with waterproofing all year. Nauru, the world's smallest republic, is an oval-shaped outcrop, situated in the Central Pacific, west of Kiribati, surrounded by a reef which is exposed at low tide. Although there is no deep-water harbour on the island, offshore moorings are reputedly the deepest in the world. A century of phosphate mining has stripped four-fifths of the land area, and has left the central plateau, which rises to 56m (213ft), infertile and unpopulated: a barren terrain of jagged coral pinnacles which stand 15m (49ft) high. The island has a fertile coastal strip 150 to 300m (492 to 984ft) wide, where there are coconut palms, pandanus trees and indigenous hardwoods such as the tomano. On the land surrounding Buada lagoon, bananas, pineapples and some vegetables are grown. Some secondary vegetation grows over the coral pinnacles which intersperse the island's beaches."
oceania,new-caledonia,"The Pacific island of New Caledonia is a nature lover’s paradise. Punching well above its weight, the island lays claim to impressive natural features including the largest lagoon in the world and a 1,500km-long (930 mile) coral reef, second only in size to Australia’s Great Barrier Reef. Inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2008, New Caledonia’s vast coral reef offers some of the most spectacular diving in the world. Not only is it an important nesting site for green turtles, but it also supports an astonishing variety of tropical fish, seabirds, sharks, whales and dugongs, also known as sea cows. Visitors will find an equally diverse mix of wildlife inland. New Caledonia is famed for its flying foxes and myriad exotic birds, including the highly intelligent Caledonian crow, which fashions hooks from branches to pick its insect prey from trees. It’s not all about the wildlife, though. This former French colony, which is now classed as a special collectivity of France, is a fascinating melting pot of Melanesian and French culture. This unlikely fusion is most visible in the capital, Nouméa, where luxury hotels, gourmet restaurants and plush boutiques compete with Melanesian cuisine, dance and other local traditions. This juxtaposition is not always harmonious however, and conflicts between France and New Caledonia sometimes flare up, reflecting their differing attitudes on self-government, French nuclear testing in the region and more. There’s been an appetite for independence for sometime now and the territory seems to be slowly moving towards sovereign status. France will be the poorer for it. 18,575 sq km (7,172 sq miles). 266,431 (UN estimate 2016). 14.6 per sq km. Nouméa. French Overseas Territory.

The indigenous population has attempted to free themselves from French rule on several occasions, including the Kanak Revolt of 1878. In recent years, intermittent conflicts between the Melanesians and the French have occurred, and majority of Kanaks (Melanesians) now support the Front de Liberation Nationale Kanak et Socialiste (National Kanak Socialist Liberation Front, FLNKS) created in 1984 and led, until his assassination in 1989, by the charismatic Jean-Marie Tjibaou. The Front is the largest party backing independence, which remains the overriding political issue in the territory. In 2014 a referendum is scheduled which may finally see New Caledonia devolve from French rule. New Caledonia is an incredibly important hotspot for biological diversity in because of its unique and complex ecological systems. Unlike its neighbours it is not volcanic, but a fragment of an ancient continent that drifted away some 250 million years ago. As such its flora and fauna have evolved in isolation, and are now quite unique. A wide variety of endemic species have flourished here. Vast Christian majority, with 59% Roman Catholic. There is a casual atmosphere, and local traditions still prevail alongside European customs. Casual wear is the norm, but smart restaurants require a more formal style of dress.

Various species of trees can be found here. This unusual relief divides Grande Terre into the East coast which is humid and open to trade winds, fertile and exotic with lush tropical vegetation, and the West coast which is dry and temperate, filled with niaouli trees, cattle and beautiful beaches."
oceania,australia,"The oldest state in the country, New South Wales gives many travellers their first taste of Australia; and it tends to be a potent one. Sydney’s ravishing waterside setting and cultural vibrancy make it one of the greatest world cities and its overall package – beaches, skyscrapers, Opera House and all – means it remains very much the centrepiece of the state (even, some might argue, the entire country). It’s a city to enjoy on your own terms. Lose yourself in the markets and coffee houses of the outer suburbs, laze in the open parklands of the centre, catch one of the ferries crisscrossing the water or tick off the big sights, from Bondi to the Harbour Bridge. History is a big draw here too, with much of the architecture, especially in ‘The Rocks’, harking back to the early days of settlement. Heading out of town, one of the state’s biggest natural draws lies just an hour or two away: the eucalyptus-hazed spectacle of the Blue Mountains. And there’s more – much more – to enjoy once you travel further afield. From the country music vibe of rural Tamworth and the hippy surfing outpost of Byron Bay to the winelands of the Hunter Valley and the national parks of the interior, there are few regions that can boast such variety. Whether you remain in NSW throughout your trip or use it as a springboard to travel elsewhere in the country, the state makes for an absorbing place to explore. From the soft, sandy beaches of Nelson Bay to the rainforested parklands of northern Nightcap National Park, it lays claim to being one of the headiest and multi-layered regions in Australia. 800,642 sq km (309,130 sq miles). 8,117,976 (2019). 10.14 per sq km. Sydney.","Ancient human remains uncovered at Mungo in southwestern New South Wales suggest the land has been inhabited by Aborigines for over 40,000 years. In 1770 James Cook and the crew of the HMS Endeavour became the first Europeans to land in Australia at what is now known as Botany Bay in southern Sydney. In 1788 New South Wales became the first Australian penal colony by the British under King George III. Australia’s first political party was established in New South Wales in 1835 by William Wentworth and the Australian Colonies Government Act of 1850 granted a representative constitution to the colony. Initially, New South Wales included the whole western half of the country, but Victoria separated from New South Wales in 1851, and eight years later Queensland followed. The Gold Rush in the 1850s attracted many settlers and the population in the neighbouring colonies rose significantly. An intense economic and political rivalry between New South Wales and Victoria led to the colonies developing in different directions in the second half of the 19th century. Victoria became increasingly protectionist and liberalist while New South Wales remained more conservative. After a lack of support for a federation of Australia’s colonies at the end of the 19th century, a majority vote in 1901 finally led to the self-governing colonies of Australia becoming part of the Commonwealth of Australia. The imposition of tariffs following the federation increased local manufacturing, and by the beginning of the 1920s, New South Wales had overtaken Victoria as the Australian leader in heavy industry. The first Aboriginal reserves were established in New South Wales as early as 1850; however, only a small percentage of Aborigines chose to live in them. The Aborigines Protection Act of 1909 gave a board the authority to ‘protect and care for Aborigines’ living in reserves. An amendment to the act in 1915 gave the board the power to remove Aboriginal children from their parents which resulted in what is now called the Stolen Generation. The Great Depression, which began in 1929, resulted in mass unemployment and a rift between the social classes. During World War II, New South Wales experienced another surge of economic development that was interrupted by post-war coal strikes. Since the 1970s new emerging industries such as information technology and financial services have taken over and major constructions such as the Sydney opera house have shaped the image of the city. Did you know? • At 4,635 km New South Wales’ border is the longest of all Australian states. • The top three languages spoken in New South Wales other than English are Mandarin, Arabic and Cantonese. • New South Wales is also referred to as ‘First State’.","New South Wales enjoys a year-round sub-tropical climate, with warm semi-tropical summers, particularly in lower central areas and cool winters. In the springtime from September to November, New South Wales comes alive with lush greenery and enjoys balmy, sunny days. This is a perfect time for a spot of whale watching, as humpbacks make their way southwards along the coast. Summer in New South Wales, December to February, is characteristically hot and dry, with maximum temperatures reaching 30°C. The northern areas of the state are typically hot, with the sub-tropical rainforests of the north becoming humid and heavy. The bushlands to the north-west experience a dry heat, which rarely cools throughout the year. March to May is state’s autumnal season, which offers pleasant and balmy temperatures. Rainfall is more common during this time, so make sure you bring an umbrella with you on any excursions. This period tends to be a busier tourist period with people flocking to the region for the cooler temperatures and clear days. Winters in the New South Wales, June to August, can be chilly with temperatures in Sydney dropping to a low of 7°C. The coolest region of New South Wales, however, is the Snowy Mountains, where snow and frost are common throughout the winter months. Mountain areas in the west are cooler, particularly in winter. Rainfall is heaviest from March to June. Lightweight cottons and linens in summer. Warmer medium weights in mountain areas. Waterproofing is advisable from March to June. The landscape ranges from the subtropical, rainforest-clad regions of the north to the Snowy Mountains in the south, which contain Australia's highest point, Mount Kosciuszko (2,228m/7,310ft), prominent alongside glacial lakes and stunning valleys. The southern coastline of New South Wales is home to 30 national parks, an abundance of bays, coves and dazzling beaches, especially around Jervis Bay and the Sapphire Coast. Contrasting that is the rugged outback territory found at Mungo and Mutawintji National Park, where previous settlements and old mining towns unearthed the mineral-rich deposits of the area. There are over 2,000km (1,200 miles) of coastline and four UNESCO World Heritage sites including Lord Howe Island, the Greater Blue Mountains area, Willandra Lakes and the Gondwana Rainforests."
oceania,new-zealand,"Widely held to be one of the most breathtaking countries on the planet, New Zealand is a phenomenal travel destination. The rugged mountains and remote valleys that thrust the destination into the world’s spotlight through The Lord of the Rings trilogy tell only part of the story – you’ll also find beaches, fjords, lakes and gorgeous swathes of forest, not to mention age-old Maori culture, forward-looking cities and, famously, a world-class array of outdoor activities. Not only does it pack a punch as hard as an All Black tackle, but it's also incredibly easy to travel around. What’s not to love? Split into two main landmasses – the North and South Islands –New Zealand is a deceptively diverse and complicated destination that rewards both first-time and repeat visitors. The North Island is less visually dramatic than its southern counterpart, but it is home to around two thirds of the country’s inhabitants. The majority of the major urban centres are here, including the capital, Wellington, and the increasingly dynamic city of Auckland. But nature is still a major player, thanks to volcanoes, thermal regions and the magnificent Bay of Islands. The South Island is home to far fewer people, but boasts the country’s most spectacular scenery. Empty beaches, soaring mountain ranges, glaciers, fjords, wide-open expanses – they’re all here. Outdoor enthusiasts can take their pick from tramping (hiking), cycling, climbing, white-water rafting, caving, zorbing, sky-diving, bungee jumping and more. Christchurch, a city bouncing back with extraordinary creativity from earthquake damage, is also here. New Zealand has also developed into one of the cleanest and greenest countries in the world. There are 14 national parks throughout the country and almost a quarter of New Zealand is protected land. What else? There’s wildlife, wine and a cultural resurgence that’s seeing local films, literature and art gaining more and more attention.

Using his magical jawbone as a hook and his blood as bait, Maui caught a great fish, which became the North Island of New Zealand. The South Island is Maui’s canoe and Stewart Island is the anchor. New Zealand, first settled by Polynesians (the Maori) in the 13th century, has a long history of conflict. The arrival of European explorer Abel Tasman in 1642 confirmed the existence of a southern continent but the first encounter with the Maori was hostile and Abel Tasman never actually set foot on the land. Captain James Cook charted the country’s coastline more than 100 years later, in 1769. His first encounter with the Maori ended in bloodshed but he persevered and established a friendly relationship. After Cook spread the word, European whalers, sealers and settlers arrived to plunder the rich marine resources and establish a new life. In 1840, the Treaty of Waitangi – a land ownership agreement between the British and the Maori – was signed, transferring New Zealand to the British crown. The treaty established British law in New Zealand but guaranteed Maori authority over their land. It is held to be New Zealand’s founding document and the original can be viewed in Wellington. A series of land wars between 1843 and 1872 ended with the defeat of the Maori and vast areas of Maori land were confiscated. In 1975, the Waitangi Tribunal was convened to settle Maori land claims and address this land grab. It has become a permanent commission of enquiry and a means of addressing issues affecting contemporary Maori. New Zealand became self-governing in 1852 and gained the status as an autonomous dominion of the British Empire in 1907. New Zealand became an independent member of the British Commonwealth in 1947. Queen Elizabeth II remains the head of state, although the monarch has no active role in running the country. As part of the British Commonwealth, New Zealand has tended to follow the United Kingdom and Australia with support in numerous wars over the years. Helen Clark became New Zealand's first woman prime minister in 1999 and was succeeded by the incumbent John Key in 2008. Did you know? • Government incentives and stunning locations have attracted a slew of recent Hollywood films to be shot in New Zealand, including Avatar, The Lord of the Rings, The Hobbit, King Kong and The Last Samurai. • Rugby union is considered the national sport and the international team, the All Blacks, perform the haka, a traditional Maori challenge before matches. • Dunedin is a UNESCO City of Literature. 55% Christian: Anglican, Presbyterian, Roman Catholic and Methodist are all represented. Should a visitor be invited to a formal Maori occasion, the hongi (pressing of noses) is common. Casual dress is widely acceptable. New Zealanders are generally very relaxed and hospitable. Stiff formality is rarely appreciated and, after introductions, first names are generally used. Smoking is restricted where indicated; it is banned in pubs and restaurants as well as on public transport and in public buildings. English is the common and everyday language, but other languages are also spoken, including Maori, which is New Zealand's second official language (spoken by the indigenous Maori people who constitute approximately 15% of the population).","Ever since the Maori christened New Zealand ‘The Land of the Long White Cloud’, weather has featured in the minds of local people. Sat in the middle of the Roaring Forties (a region with strong westerly winds), New Zealand enjoys an ocean temperate climate, making it pleasant most of the year round with occasional periods of cool, rain and wind. There is, however, a wide range of conditions from north to south, with subtropical weather in the north and more temperate conditions in the south. Generally, the north has no extremes of heat or cold; winter can be quite cool in the south, with snow in the mountains. The eastern areas often experience drought conditions in summer; the west, particularly in the South Island, has more rain. New Zealand’s seasons are directly opposite to those of the northern hemisphere although it’s often possible to have all four represented in one day. Spring (September/October) is beautiful as new blooms emerge, yet the peaks stay snow-capped; summer (November to March) enjoys the best overall weather; autumn (March/April) is a time of spectacular colours, especially on the South Island; winters (April/May to August September) tend to be wet and cool. There's great winter skiing in the centre of the North Island and in the South Island's Southern Alps, where heli-skiing is particularly popular. The best time to visit, taking into account the climate, crowds and other conditions, is October/November or March/April. Lightweight cottons and linens are worn in the North Island most of the year and in summer in the South Island. Medium weights are worn during winter in South Island. Rainwear is advisable throughout the year, and essential if visiting South Island's rainforest areas. A hat and sunblock are essential during the summer thanks to the ozone depletion above New Zealand. New Zealand encompasses two major islands stretching north and south that are separated by the Cook Strait; a third, less substantial island, Stewart Island, is located 30 km (19 miles) off the tip of the South Island across Foveaux Strait. The three main islands are fringed with numerous smaller islands. The more developed North Island (116,031 sq km/44,800 sq miles) is home to the main cities, including the country's largest city Auckland. The island’s rolling green hills are dotted with sheep and horses, and the central heartland pulses with geothermal activity; boiling mud pools, geysers and active volcanoes. The dramatic South Island (153,540 sq km/59,283 sq miles), is a stunning microcosm of snow-covered alps, fjords, glaciers and charming British-style towns such as Christchurch and Dunedin. Stewart Island (1,746 sq km/674 sq miles) is largely undeveloped and an excellent indication of what much of the country must have once looked like. Its permanent population is slightly over 400, most of whom live in the only major settlement, Oban. There are four associated territories: the Cook Islands, which lie 3,500km (2,175 miles) northeast of New Zealand; Niue, 920km (570 miles) west of the Cook Islands; Tokelau, three atolls about 960km (600 miles) northwest of Niue; and the Ross Dependency, which consists of over 700,000 sq km (270,270 sq miles) of the Antarctic. Note: The Cook Islands and Niue have separate individual sections in the World Travel Guide."
oceania,niue,"Laidback, friendly and unremittingly beautiful, tiny Niue is an idyllic retreat from the modern world. The island nation’s rugged coastline, crystal clear waters and coral reefs offer excellent diving, snorkelling and whale watching. Birdwatchers are also well catered for: parakeets, white-tailed terns and other exotic birds and butterflies can be spotted darting among hibiscus and orchids. Despite its remote location in the South Pacific, Niue is rarely short of visitors, with regular flights from Auckland bringing planeloads of sun-seeking Kiwis. At the same time however, there are only a handful of hotels, so it never feels crowded – sometimes it’s easy to imagine you have the island all to yourself. Arrive between July and October, and you can not only witness the annual humpback whale migration, but even join them for a swim. And if your trip doesn’t coincide with these gentle cetaceans, spinner dolphin pods are resident year-round. The island is literally the tip of an undersea mountain, so head offshore and the land plunges rapidly into the deep. You can hook marlin, wahoo and skipjack tuna without having to sail miles from the coast. Directly beneath the water’s surface, snorkellers and divers can explore an underwater paradise of hidden caves and chasms rife with colourful sea creatures. And above water, Niue’s limestone caves conceal fossils, secret passageways and ancient burial places, while alluring trails lead you through tropical rainforest to secluded sandy coves. There’s even room for nine holes of golf. If you’re feeling particularly adventurous, sign up to the Rally of the Rock, an annual bike ride that takes Lycra-clad participants through a mixture of bush tracks and paved roads. Whatever you do in Niue, it’s usually not long before you’ve got to know half the island’s population, who make sure you have the time of your life. 262 sq km (101 sq miles). 1,612 (UN estimate 2016). 4.5 per sq km.

The first Europeans reached Niue in the wake of Captain Cook's expedition to the region in 1774. Administered by the London Missionary Society from 1846, it became a British Protectorate in 1900. The island was then formally annexed to New Zealand in 1901, as part of the Cook Islands. In October 1974, Niue was granted 'self-government in free association with New Zealand', making it the smallest self-governing state with that status. This also allows Niueans to retain New Zealand citizenship while maintaining self-government in their own country. The only formal political party is the Niue People's Party (NPP), which has dominated politics on the island since its formation in 1987. Although it has not always enjoyed an absolute majority, it has been able to govern with the support of independents. The current premier is the veteran Mititaigimimene Young Vivian who took over following the most recent poll in April 2002. The major problems facing Niue are chronic population decline caused by emigration and the fragility of the island's status as an offshore tax haven (see Economy section), which is under threat from new measures designed to tackle international money laundering. Niue is also vulnerable to Pacific cyclones: in January 2004, the island suffered serious damage from Cyclone Heta. Most people belong to the Ekalesia Niue, a Protestant denomination; also Latter Day Saints (Mormon), Jehovah's Witness, Roman Catholic, Seventh Day Adventist and other Christian denominations. Niuean children are bestowed with gifts of money or handmade mats and cloths from their relatives upon coming of age, when girls have their ears pierced and boys receive their first haircut. It is polite to ask permission before entering private land. Niueans consider Sunday as a serious day of rest and most attend church both in the morning and afternoon. While many people play golf, go swimming or sightsee, certain activities, such as boating and fishing, are not allowed on Sunday. For further information on Sunday protocol, contact the Niue Tourism Office (see Contact Addresses).

Affectionately known as 'the rock', Niue is reputedly the largest upraised coral atoll in the world. It has 2,500 hectares (6,178 acres) of the most undisturbed forests in the world, designated tapu areas by the locals, where no humans were allowed to set foot for centuries. Now all the tapu forests, except the one controlled by Hakupu village, are penetrable. These forests are full of lush undergrowth, coconut palms and some of the oldest-known ebony trees on earth.

oceania,pacific-islands-of-micronesia,"The Northern Mariana Islands consist of a chain of 14 islands nearly 89km (55 miles) in length. Volcanic in origin, they host a variety of scenery including beautiful bays, spectacular cliffs, caves and mountains. Because of the islands' location they played a significant part in World War II, having been tussled over by the US and Japan, and the many shipwrecks around the coast bear witness to this. Diving in the clear waters is popular, both for exploring the numerous coral reefs and the the jaw-dropping wrecks on the ocean floor. It was also from here – namely the tiny island of Tinian – that the US sent B-29s to drop the atomic bomb on Japan. There are quite stark contrasts on the island. The capital of Saipan is overly commercialised for the tastes of many, full of tourbuses and characterless modern buildings. But it is also busily adjusting to ongoing economic woes, largely linked to the near-disappearance of what was once a thriving Japanese-tourism market. Beyond Saipan, traditional Chamorro culture endures, if not completely intact. These islands were settled by émigrés from South East Asia as long as six thousand years ago, with the islanders' ancestors are known to have built a network of giant megaliths, little of which has survived. In 2013, archaeologists theorised that the first settlers of the Marianas made the longest uninterrupted ocean-crossing voyage in the history of humanity. Archaeological evidence also points to Tinian being the first Pacific island outside Asia to have hosted settlers. Beyond the history, both wondrous and grim, the Northern Mariana Islands enjoy white beaches, azure waters and stunning flame trees.

Following a referendum in 1975, the Northern Mariana Islands became internally self-governing with a bicameral legislature (see Government section, below). In 1984, President Reagan extended the American civil and political rights available to the residents of the Northern Marianas and two years later, after the end of the UN mandate, the territory acquired US Commonwealth status. At this point, the residents were granted US citizenship. Domestic politics traditionally mirrored the RepublicanDemocrat duopoly until the recent emergence of the Convenant Party, which is independent of both the major US parties. At the most recent elections held in November 2001, the Republican candidate, Juan Babauta, won with 43 per cent of the poll. However, at the most recent poll for the local House of Representatives, the Covenant Party was returned as the largest party. The islands face significant social and economic problems that are largely attributable to the rapid growth of the population in the last two decades and the lack both of adequate employment opportunities and infrastructure.

oceania,australia,"Proud of its muscular individuality, ""the Territory"" is where preconceptions of Australia's tough, time-carved wilderness find their fullest shape. From the ancient green plains of the so-called Top End (the northernmost section of the Australian continent) to the natural wonders of the Red Centre, it's a region that deals in physical extremes. Travel here gives a far more untamed feel to the country than a trip along Australia's East Coast, and its relative remoteness is a big part of the appeal. That is not to say the Northern Territory is without its home comforts, of course. Capital city Darwin is a laid-back tropical city with an upbeat bar scene, some eye-catching new developments and a thick multicultural flavour. Hang out at beach markets, take a sunset cruise or delve into the city's remarkable history – more wartime bombs fell here than at Pearl Harbor. Famously, the city is also the gateway to the phenomenal Kakadu National Park, a vast swathe of land with a powerful indigenous heritage and wildlife ranging from crocodiles to sea eagles. Heading south along the Stuart Highway – which runs the length of the state – obvious stop-offs include the likes of Litchfield National Park, known for its waterfalls and swimming holes; Nitmiluk Gorge, one of Australia's most dramatic kayaking spots; Alice Springs, a bold and fascinating city in the middle of the country; and of course the mighty rock formations of the Red Centre, most notably the genuinely breathtaking enormity of Uluru. Across the Northern Territory, much of the landscape is draped in Dreamtime legend, so you'll also find numerous opportunities for bushwalking, ""bush tucker"" tasting or simply learning more about Aboriginal culture. 1,349,129 sq km (520,902 sq miles). 247,159 (2018). 0.2 per sq km. Darwin.","It is thought that the history of the Northern Territory began when indigenous inhabitants occupied in the region some 60,000 years ago. It remains somewhere rich in Aboriginal heritage, and a fitting place to learn more about the traditional landowners' ancient and enigmatic culture. The modern history, however, only began when George Goyder, the Surveyor-General of South Australia, established a small settlement at Port Darwin in 1869, which at that time was known as Palmerston. A year later, the first poles for the Australian Overland Telegraph Line (OTL) were erected – 3,200km (1,988 miles) in length, the OTL was a remarkable feat of engineering that provided communication links from Australia's south to its north – and, by consequence, to the outside world. The OTL would not have been possible without the pioneering exploits of John McDouall Stuart, after whom the north-south Stuart Highway is now named. More fortuitous was the discovery of gold at Pine Creek by workers erecting pylons for the OTL, which led to a gold rush that saw more settlers descend on the Top End. By 1911, having survived a cyclone and changed its name to Darwin (a nod to the fact that the HMS Beagle once laid anchor here), the outpost had become a small but efficient government centre. The Northern Territory gained a hard-earned reputation as a place of individual spirit, extreme weather and larger-than-life characters. Darwin took a battering from Japanese air raids during WWII, and it was partly a sense of panic over possible invasion that then led to the construction of the aforementioned Stuart Highway, which connected Darwin to another settlement from the OTL era, Alice Springs, and on to South Australia. The Territory went on to prosper in the decades after war, before Cyclone Tracy rolled in on Christmas Eve 1974 and reduced much of Darwin to rubble. Since then, however, strong links with Asia, a robust mining industry and a growing awareness of the region's super-sized tourism offering (where else can boast the likes of Uluru and Kakadu?) has given it much to be optimistic about. Did you know? •	The Museum and Art Gallery of the Northern Territory still exhibits a 5.1m (16.7ft) saltwater crocodile caught in 1979. Its name?

Darwin, the capital, sits by the Timor Sea and experiences a tropical climate with average highs staying pretty consistent from 29°C (84°F) to 32°C (90°F) year-round. It has two distinct wet and dry seasons. • The wet season in Darwin: October to April is the wet season with majority of the rainfall occurs between December and March - it is safe to expect 18 to 22 rainy days a month during this period. In January, the average high is 31°C (88°F) and the average low is 26°C (79°F), while the average rainfall is 420mm (17 inches), making January the wettest month. • The dry season in Darwin: May to September is the dry season – as Darwin sizzles in sunshine, this is the best time to visit Darwin. In July, the average high is 29°C (84°F) and the average low is 22°C (72°F), while the average rainfall is just 10mm (0.4 inches). Located just south of the Tropic of Capricorn, Alice Springs has a desert climate with temperatures vary widely. Although the annual average high is 29°C (84°F), temperatures over 44°C (111°F) have been frequently recorded from October to February. The best time to visit Alice Springs is from June to August when average highs dip to 21°C (70°F) – but bring a jacket as night time temperatures can fall below freezing. Rainfall, despite little, mostly occurs between November and March. Lightweight cottons and linens most of the year. Waterproofing is necessary in the northern areas during the rainy season. A warm sweater or jacket is advised for Alice Springs and the sourthern region from June to August as night time temperatures can drop to below freezing.  A wilderness stretching roughly 1,670km (1,038 miles) from Darwin and Kakadu in the north to Uluru (Ayers Rock) in the south and 1,000km (620 miles) east to west, the Northern Territory comprises nearly one-sixth of Australian mainland. It is roughly the size of France, Spain and Italy combined. Due to its size, it is common to hear people use the phrases ‘Top End’ and ‘Red Centre’ when referring to a chunk of geographical region within the Territory. Here is a summary: The Top End: The Top End is referred to the geographical area covering Darwin the capital of the Northern Territory, UNESCO-listed Kakadu National Park, Arnhem Land (an area of vast flood plains and rocky escarpments steeped in natural and cultural heritage, as it is said that Aboriginal people have lived here for at least 35,000 years) and the Katherine area. The Red Centre: The Red Centre is centred around Alice Springs, which is almost at the geographical centre of Australia and the starting point of many of the Red Centre's unique and natural wonders, including Uluru (Ayers Rock)."
oceania,pacific-islands-of-micronesia,"Micronesia comprises four archipelagos: the Federated States of Micronesia (Caroline Islands), the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the Northern Mariana Islands and the Republic of Palau. The area has a turbulent history of foreign control and political change. Despite upheavals and foreign influences from Spanish, German, Japanese and US governments, many inhabitants have maintained their cultural heritage and traditions, while others have lifestyles inspired mainly by the teachings of 19th-century missionaries. Having come under UN Trusteeship, administered by the USA, at the end of World War II, all of the Pacific Micronesian states have now reached final political settlements. Collectively, the islands are known for the dramatic tropical nature, pristine beaches and great diving opportunities. By contrast, the area has witnessed some of the darkest moments in recent history, with shipwrecks littering the sea beds, heavy nuclear weapons testing having been staged in the area, and the islet Tinian having the dubious privilege as being the launchpad from which the American B-29s set off for Japan to drop the Atom bomb.

oceania,pacific-islands-of-micronesia,"An untamed paradise for divers and snorkellers, Paula is an archipelago of more than 500 islands, which sprout like giant mushrooms from the crystalline waters of the Pacific Ocean. The island of Koror is the beating heart of the country and the entry point for most visitors. Home to most of Palau’s inhabitants, it is far from the prettiest island in the archipelago and few choose to linger here. Those who do, however, can grab a slice of Micronesian life in the local bars and restaurants, where charismatic natives take pleasure convincing foreigners to try the local delicacy: fruit bat soup. Palau is also home to some of the world’s healthiest and most impressive UNESCO-listed reefs. Iridescent corals swirl around the islands, their marine populations teeming with a bounty few other places can match. Indeed, not a list exists that doesn’t rank Palau’s Blue Corner amongst the planet’s top dive sites. It isn’t just in the tropical seas where strange creatures thrive, for Palau is also home to one of the most ecologically sensitive and unique evolutionary phenomena: Jellyfish Lake. Cut off from the sea millions of years ago, the lake’s predator-free inhabitants have evolved to lose their poisonous sting. To snorkel slowly amongst these gentle creatures is to float through an alien world. While it’s easy to see Palau's beauty, a closer look will reveal scars from ferocious battles that took place on these shores during WWII. Ship and plane wrecks remain buried in dark lagoons, while long-forgotten bunkers and rusted machine guns are peppered across the islands. This is testament to Palau’s tumultuous modern history, which saw it swap hands from Germany to Japan and, finally, the Untied States, before achieving independence in 1994. While Palau may be remote and untamed, it is precisely these attributes that make it one of the world’s last unspoiled natural beauties. The archipelago endures as a marvel of Mother Nature, stands proud as a centre for Micronesian culture and offers a haunting memorial to battles once fought in its turquoise waters. 459 sq km (177 sq miles). 21,501 (UN estimate 2016). 46.3 per sq km.

The region was first visited by Europeans in the 16th century and was made part of the Spanish East Indies in 1574, although it was more than a century before the first map of Palau was drawn. Following defeat in the 1898 Spanish-American war, Spain sold the islands to Germany, which exploited their natural resources until Palau was seized by Japan in 1914. The United States then took the islands in 1944 after the ferocious WWII Battle of Peleliu, which resulted in the deaths of more than 2,000 American and 10,000 Japanese soldiers. After liberation from Japanese occupation, Palau became part of the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, administered by the USA under a mandate from the UN in 1947. In 1986, the governments of Palau and the USA agreed the terms of a Compact of Free Association, which allowed for virtual independence under a US defence umbrella. The Palau Compact, however, remained unsigned, because of a crucial clause forbidding the presence of any nuclear weapons on the islands, including visits by ships equipped to carry them. The USA refused to sign the Compact until the clause was rescinded and the dispute introduced a violent aspect into Palau's politics – President Haruo Remeliik was assassinated in 1985 and his successor, Lazarus Salii, committed suicide in August 1988. At the presidential election of 1992, Kuniwo Nakamura won a narrow victory. The island was faced with a choice of accepting the Compact or seeking full independence – a hazardous proposition for economic reasons. In October 1994, the Compact was endorsed and Palau was admitted to the UN in December 1994. Nakamura served a second term between 1996 and 2000 after which he was replaced by president, Tommy Remengesau, who took office for a second four-year term in 2013. Although wealthier than many of its near neighbours, Palau wrestles with the typical problems of all Pacific islands – isolation, a lack of infrastructure and rising sea levels caused by climate change. Did you know? •	The 1968 film, Hell in the Pacific, starring Lee Marvin was shot in Palau. •	Palau has a national football team, but is not part of FIFA. •	In 2012 Palau received the Future Policy Award from the World Future Council for its protection of marine ecosystems. Roman Catholic majority. When it comes to everyday interactions, most Palauans expect some form of salutation, and it’s considered rude not to say ‘hello’ or ‘good morning’ when encountering someone. If visiting someone’s home, a small gift for the host will be highly appreciated. When it comes to eating, it’s considered polite to try everything you’re offered and eating more will be taken as a sign of enjoyment. The practice of chewing and spitting out the red juice of the betelnut is commonplace amongst locals. Traditional Palauan society follows a complex matrilineal system that is still at play when it comes to rites of passage such as death, birth and marriages. The people are now amongst the most enterprising in the region, though a version of traditional beliefs – Modekngei – exists alongside the imported Christian beliefs. The political system is modelled on that of the USA, and Western culture is being assimilated - not least because of the many Palauans who continue their education abroad. However the traditional government still wields a lot of influence. Palau has two official languages – Palauan and English. The majority of residents speak both without difficulty. With around a third of the population consisting of migrants from the Philippines and their descendants, Tagalog is the fourth most-spoken language. Amongst older Palauans, Japanese is also spoken.","Being so close to the equator, Palau enjoys a steady warm climate all year round with an annual average temperature of 30°C (86°F). Dry season runs from November to April with maximum temperatures of around 32°C (90°F) and lows of 27°C (81°F). Humidity is high all year round. Rainy season falls between July and October, and thunderstorms are quite common but typhoons, when it can rain for days at a time, are fairly rare, as the islands are too close to the equator to be in the hurricane corridor. For divers, the best time to go to Palau is during the dry season, from September to May, when calmer seas mean it's easier for boats to get to particular areas. Manta rays can be seen all year round, but to see the sharks you'll need to visit in March. Palau's temperate climate means that for the majority of trips, not much more than lightweight cottons, linens and beachwear will be needed. Keep a jumper on you for the evenings and if you're venturing inland. If you're planning to do some outdoor activities – hiking, kayaking, etc – then be sure to take the specialist equipment that you'll need. Rain is possible all year round so don't go without packing some sort of light rainwear – a good quality waterproof jacket may be sufficient. The stunning islands of Palau lie 1,000km (600 miles) east of the Philippines in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. Strung out like emeralds in a necklace, the archipelago stretches over 650km (400 miles) from the atoll of Kayangel in the north to the islet of Tobi in the south. The eight main islands which are inhabited make up the bulk of Palau, but the archipelago includes more than 200 islands, and it is part of the larger Caroline Islands chain which also includes the Federated States of Micronesia. With three exceptions, all of the islands are located within a single barrier reef and represent two geological formations. The largest are volcanic and rugged with interior jungle and large areas of grassed terraces. The Rock Islands, now known as the Floating Garden Islands, are of limestone formation, while Kayangel, at the northernmost tip, is a classic coral atoll."
oceania,papua-new-guinea,"Papua New Guinea is a fascinating country where travellers can explore remote villages, as well as enjoying spectacular diving, stunning wildlife, scenic surfing and myriad cultures. The tribal diversity of a country with over 800 languages and 600 islands cannot easily be summarised, although in Papua New Guinea it is the tribal life that is most fascinating to the visitor. Beyond the dizzying array of ethnic groups to get to know, there are many unique attractions, excursions and activities on offer, from discovering wrecks of World War II aircraft that lie in the jungle, to peeking inside the sacred wooden haustambarans (spirit houses) of towns and villages in the country. One of the largest draws for those visiting Papua New Guinea is the country's extensive wildlife and unique ecosystem. From the mountainous highlands to the Evian-blue waters, travellers can expect to discover weird and wonderful creatures, from tree-climbing kangaroos to spectacular birds of paradise; there are almost 700 bird species on the islands. Be sure to visit the National Botanic Gardens in Port Moresby, which is probably the capital's greenest, most beautiful sport. Most of the country remains undeveloped, with the largest island of Bouganville avoiding from resort hotels and commercialisation – ideal for the independent traveller. Above all, though, it's the inhabitants that make Papua New Guinea truly unique. Many of the hundreds of languages spoken here are kept alive by a just a few dozen people. Each ethnic group has its own proud artistic traditions, with deft handicrafts, entrancing dance performances and bracing music. If you happen to visit during a festival – to be fair, there are many of them occurring throughout the year – prepare to be spellbound by tribal concerts and elaborate headdresses. Spend a bit of time here, and you'll feel as if you've gained access to a bygone era, although it would be wrong to describe the inhabitants as stuck in the past.

The Dutch East India Company took control of the western half of the island in 1828, which was then split between the British and Germans in the 1880s until after World War 1 when it was transferred to the sole control of Australia before being occupied by the Japanese during World War 2.After 1945, the renamed Papua New Guinea reverted to Australian administration and was granted independence in 1975. It remains a separate Commonwealth realm with Queen Elizabeth II as its head of state, but its Governor-General – currently Sir Michael Ogio – is unusual in that the post is elected by the legislature rather than appointed by government. The main problem for successive governments has been how to make the most of Papua New Guinea's abundant natural resources in order to finance its development while maintaining its natural environment. It's a delicate balancing act that has led to civil unrest, not least in 1989 when a secessionist revolt on the copper-rich island of Bourgainville flared up. It was to claim 20,000 lives before it was resolved in 2007 with local autonomy and the promise of a referendum on independence before 2020. The tension between protecting and exploiting the country's natural assets continues as discussions around reopening the massive Panguna copper mine – once the world's largest open pit copper mine – in Bourgainville show few signs of resolution. Papua New Guinea is one of the world's most culturally diverse nations with more than a thousand cultural groups and some 852 languages recognised, of which 12 have no known speakers. It is also one of the least explored places on Earth with many undiscovered species of animals and plants thought to exist in the country's interior, as well as groups of people that have had no previous contact with the outside world.

The main island shares a land border with Irian Jaya, a province of Indonesia. The mainland and larger islands are mountainous and rugged, divided by large fertile upland valleys. Fast-flowing rivers from the highlands descend to the coastal plains. A line of active volcanoes stretches along the north coast of the mainland and continues on the island of New Britain. To the north and south of this central mountain range on the main island lie vast stretches of mangrove swamps and coastal river deltas."

It’s a wonderfully diverse state; full of spirit and rich diversion, exuding a sense of life being lived at its rightful pace. With its wildlife, weather and the seemingly unlimited range of outdoor activities, it’s hard not to fall in love with its sandy shores. Bungee-jumper, birdwatcher or beach bum, you’ll find plenty to enjoy. Attention tends to fall, naturally enough, on the coast. The Great Barrier Reef is the headline attraction, stretching along the coastline for 2,300km (1,429 miles), serving up some of the most spectacular scenery in the country, both above and below the water. Whether you’re joining a yacht in the Whitsundays, learning to dive in Cairns or just taking a road trip up to the tropical north, the reef can be experienced in all manner of ways. To the south, state capital Brisbane is the third-largest city in Australia and a lively place to spend time, drawing plaudits for everything from its riverside setting to its food scene. Meanwhile, Surfers Paradise caters for the party crowd, Noosa is a super-relaxed coastal refuge, and Fraser Island lays on 4WD adventures. Heading inland, the craggy drama of the Great Dividing Range and the sweeping scenery of the outback hold highlights of their own. To the north, Daintree Rainforest shelters a vast array of flora and fauna, stretching up to the lush greenery of Cape Tribulation. Slightly further west you can experience the magic waterfalls of Atherton Tablelands, of which Millaa Millaa is the most famous. A little further down and you stumble upon the old school charm of Magnetic Island, whose secluded beaches offer castaway vibes.

Brisbane.","Aborigines are thought to have arrived in the area that is now known as Queensland as early as 50,000 BC. It is believed that its warm climate and a good supply of food are what made Queensland the most populated area of the continent before the British settlement. Queensland saw the arrivals of several European explorers in the 17th and 18th century before the first permanent settlers arrived in Australia in the late 18th century. In 1825, Brisbane was established as a British convict settlement, however, it was closed 14 years later and reopened for free settlement in 1842. Brisbane started to become an important hub for wool and other produce with the arrival of farmers and other free settlers. All this time, Queensland was considered part of the British-controlled colony of New South Wales. But on 6 June 1859, upon the approval of Queen Victoria, the new colony of Queensland was established. In the late 1800s, the Gold Rush reached Queensland, leading to yet another increase in settlers. Other industries, such as mining and sugar production, also prospered on the back of gold rushes. While commerce flourished, Queensland had its fair share of conflicts which began almost a century ago and continued since. Clashes between Aborigines and settlers, known as the Australian frontier wars, occurred from time to time. It is said that during these wars, Queensland had the highest Aboriginal fatalities of all the Australian colonies. In 1901 the majority of Queenslanders voted to join the Federation of Australia and together with five other colonies, they form the Commonwealth of Australia. The vote put an end to the colonial era. Did you know? • Five of the 11 World Natural Heritage sites of Australia are in Queensland. • Queensland has the nickname ‘The Sunshine State’ because it gets an average of 8-9 hours of sunshine per day. • Fraser Island, off the coast of Queensland, is the world’s largest sand island.","Queensland straddles the Tropic of Capricorn, which accounts for the pleasant climate throughout most of the region. Exceptions are the far north, which is tropical and has a wet and dry season, and the arid western outback, which is fiery hot in summer. Brisbane enjoys an average of 8.2 hours of sunshine daily in the winter. The period between November to April is generally humid throughout the state, but sea breezes temper the humidity and make for perfect holiday conditions. Typically, the low season runs from December to March, during which the part season on the Gold Coast takes off. However, hotels and hostels are typically quieter and cheaper, offering the same warmth as the summer months. It is extremely important, however, to realise that swimming is unsafe from November to May when the shorelines become home to the migrating box jellyfish. Ocean baths that line the beaches are safe alternatives. High season typically runs from June to September with a fine and mild climate, that benefits visibility on the Great Barrier Reef. Lightweight cottons and linens year-round. Waterproofing is advisable in the wet season in the tropical north. Insect repellent and sun cream are essential in all areas of Queensland. Seven times the size of the UK, Queensland is known as the 'Sunshine State', priding itself on an average of around 300 days of sunshine a year. Within its borders lies the Great Barrier Reef, miles of golden sandy beaches, national park forests, vast plains, lush rainforests, forested mountains and extensive wilderness areas. The coastal plains of the north reach out to the Gulf of Carpentaria. East of the Great Dividing Range there are a range of offshore islands which comprise the Great Barrier Reef and other coral formations such as the Whitsunday Islands. Tropical islands and national parks lie north of Brisbane while the Gold Coast reaches south.

oceania,samoa,"Samoa offers visitors the chance to experience Polynesia at its most authentic. The capital, Apia, lies on the beautiful north coast of Upolu, the largest and most populous of the country's nine islands. In the Aleipata district, waterfalls and white-sand beaches dominate the landscape. A 65km (40 mile) drive from Apia leads to the Falefa Falls, Mafa Pass and the Fuipisia Falls. Indeed, Samoa's natural attributes have an intoxicating effect on first-time visitors – islands' teeming jungles, mighty waterfalls and stunning sea have won many a tourist's heart. Thankfully, there are no colossal resorts to mar this landscape, while the locals are humble and welcoming. For the closest thing there is to earthly bliss, head to Savai'i, a veritable land before time, only a stone's throw from the relative civilisation of Apia. The fa'a Samoa (the Samoan way) is arguably the most vibrant living culture in Polynesia, with a heritage that dates back 2,000 years. Only a small nation, Samoa is nevertheless the heart of Polynesia both culturally and, indeed, geographically. Compared to almost any other Pacific island, its hangs on staunchly to the traditional Polynesian way of life. Efforts by 19th-century missionaries sought to challenge the time-worn ways of the Samoans, to little effect. Ruled by both Germany and New Zealand in the 20th century, Samoa gained independence in 1962. The Scottish poet and novelist, Robert Louis Stevenson, spent his final five years living on the island – his tomb on Mount Vaea is visible from the lawn of his house, now a museum. That Samoa must have influenced Stevenson's most famous book, Treasure Island, hardly needs saying. Samoa is as isolated as it is enticing, much-loved of the adventurous and with a rich, precious culture to boot. There are few destinations as unique as this one. 2,831 sq km (1,093 sq miles). 194,523 (UN estimate 2016). 69.9 per sq km. Apia. Republic. Tuiatua Tupua Tamasese Efi since 2007. Prime Minister Tuila'epa Sailele Malielegaoi since 1998.","The Samoan islands had been inhabited for almost 3,000 years before their first contact with Europeans early in the 18th century. It wasn’t until the 1830s that regular visits saw British missionaries and traders arrive and duly convert many islanders to Christianity. In their wake, it was the Germans and Americans who vied to take control with Britain sending troops to protect its interests. Between them the three colonial powers supported an eight-year civil war and direct confrontation was only avoided by a massive storm that damaged or destroyed their warships in Apia Harbour. Following a second civil war, Britain and the USA settled their differences and the island group was divided between Germany and the USA. Contemporary Samoa comprises those islands colonised by the Germans, who declared a protectorate over them in 1899. During WWI, the Germans were driven out by New Zealand. Measures towards autonomy were introduced in the 1950s, before Samoa became the first Pacific island to gain independence in 1962 as Western Samoa, the name it kept until 1997. The period of rule from Auckland, typified by racism, neglect and brutality, carries bitter memories for the Samoans and in 2002, New Zealand premier Helen Clark formally apologised to the Samoan people for their maltreatment during that time. Political parties in the normal sense did not feature in Samoan politics until the late 1970s when a group of Fono (national assembly) members in opposition to the government created the Human Rights Protection Party (HRPP) which has dominated Samoan politics ever since. In 1997 Western Samoa changed its name to Samoa. A year later, Prime Minister Tuilaepa Sailele Malielegaoi was heavily criticised for changing the side of the road that Samoans drive on from right to left. The switch led to the biggest protest in Samoan history and the foundation of the People’s Party. The Samoans are very active in the democratic process and since the introduction of universal suffrage in 1991 turn out for elections has averaged around 90%. Did you know? •	Tuilaepa became the first elected leader to represent his country at a multi-sport event when he took part in target archery at the 2007 South Pacific Games. •	Robert Louis Stevenson lived on Samoa from 1889 until his death in 1894. •	Samoa has no regular armed forces but can call on those of New Zealand under the terms of the 1962 Treaty of Friendship. Congregational Church, Roman Catholic, Methodist, Latter Day Saints, Seventh Day Adventist and other, mainly Christian, beliefs. Even more than their American Samoan neighbours, Samoans adhere to traditional moral and religious codes of behaviour. According to the government, the Samoan is the purest surviving Polynesian type, with a reputation for being upright and dignified in character. Life in each village is still regulated by a council of chiefs with considerable financial and territorial power; this 'extended family' social system is intricately and unusually linked with the overall political system. Visitors should avoid walking through villages during evening prayer (usually between 1800 and 1900). Sunday is a day of peace and quiet, and visitors should behave quietly and travel slowly through villages. It is recommended for women to wear a lavalava (sarong); nude or topless bathing is prohibited. When entering a fale (palm-roofed open beach huts), shoes should be removed, visitors should never stand when elders are seated, and when sitting down, the soles of feet should not be shown (the yogic cross-legged style is a good option). Permission should always be asked before taking photographs in a village. Visitors should not offer money to children, even when they ask. Samoan is the national language. English is used in business and commerce.","Samoa has a warm, tropical climate tempered by trade winds between May and September. Temperatures remain relatively constant throughout the year, becoming cooler at night. There are more than 2,500 hours of sunshine annually. Rainfall is heaviest between December and April. Sea temperatures rarely fall below 24°C (75.2°F). Lightweight cottons and linens with warmer clothes for evenings. Rainwear is advisable. Samoa consists of nine islands. The largest of these is Savai'i, which covers 1,610 sq km (622 sq miles); fertile Upolu, the second largest (1,120 sq km/433 sq miles), lies 13km (8 miles) to the southeast across the Apolima Strait. The islands are quiescent volcanoes and reach heights of up to 1,858m (6,097ft) on Savai'i and 1,100m (3,608ft) on Upolu. Volcanic activity has not occurred since 1911. The main city, Apia, is located in the north of Upolu."
oceania,solomon-islands,"The Solomon Islands archipelago is made up of nearly 1,000 tropical islands scattered across the southwestern Pacific, just to the east of Papua New Guinea. The remote location has kept the islands an unspoilt gem of a travel destination, with a slowly developing tourist industry. The main islands to visit are Guadalcanal, Malaita, Choiseul, New Georgia, San Cristobal and Santa Isabel. The capital of Honiara, on Guadalcanal, is also well worth some time, with a museum, botanical gardens and its very own Chinatown. Villages and scenic drives are within easy reach of the capital, as are the popular World War II battlefield tours and carving villages on the islands of Rennell and Bellona. Many Pacific islands are well geared to tourism today, but Solomon Islands bucks the trend, with a few shambolic guesthouses to stay in and a thoroughly laid-back approach to life. No palatial resorts here. The locals pride themselves in preserving the natural beauty of the islands. Wander the jungle-strewn landscapes and take pleasure in stumbling across leaf-hut villages. Indeed, the traditional culture of the islanders endures to this day. Some 70 languages are spoken among the half a million largely Melanesian inhabitants, the majority of whom are Christian, though they also cling to their ancient customs. Many still wear traditional indigenous clothing, while the pan flute can be heard everywhere. On the natural side, there are volcanic islands to explore, vast lagoons, spell-binging rainforests and countless tropical islands. Be sure to tour the mangrove forests, but beware of crocodiles. More active visitors can go surfing and kayaking, while the well-kept coral reefs offer ample opportunity for snorkelling. Guided tours into the yawning chasm of an extinct volcano is another unmissable, as are dives down to shipwrecks from World War II. The Solomon Islands may not be that well known compared to other regional destinations, but this makes them all the more enticing for the adventurous traveller. 28,896 sq km (11,157 sq miles). 594,934 (UN estimate 2016). 21.5 per sq km. Honiara. Constitutional monarchy. HM King Charles III since 2022, represented locally by Governor-General Sir David Vunagi since 2019. Prime Minister Jeremiah Manele since 2024.","The modern nation of the Solomon Islands is an amalgamation of two archipelagos, instigated by the British in the last years of the 19th century and marking the high point of imperial rivalry in the Pacific between the major European powers. The northern group had originally been claimed by the Spanish in the 16th century, was then annexed by the Germans and finally ceded to the British in exchange for part of the Samoan island group. The British already controlled the southern Solomon group and administered the pair together as the British Solomon Islands Protectorate. The islands experienced some of the most intense fighting of World War 2 as Japanese forces occupied the territory and doggedly resisted a series of attempts to oust them, most notably the bloody Battle of Guadalcanal. The Solomon Islands remained under British rule until the 1970s. Self-government was granted in 1976 and full independence was achieved two years later. The main political debate since then has been over-decentralisation. Advocates support the division of the archipelago into separate administrative regions, while opponents maintain that the process would give an excessive advantage in the future to those islands which are most commercially developed – generally those closer to Papua New Guinea and Australia. Many of the roots of the debate lie in the issue of land ownership and the long-running disputes spilled over into ethnic violence that brought country to its knees. Bankrupt and with the capital in chaos, in 2003 the Solomon Islands appealed to the outside world for help and the Australian-led Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands arrived to put the country back together. Queen Elizabeth II remains head of state and the current Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavere is serving his third term in office, but the islands' governments are characteristically weak and politically unstable leaving them open to frequent votes of no confidence and changes of ministerial personnel. Did you know? • Future US President John F Kennedy was shipwrecked on Plum Pudding Island following his boat's collision with Japanese destroyer 'Amagiri' on 1 August 1943. Kennedy invited his rescuers Biuku Gasa and Eroni Kumana to his inauguration but local officials tricked them out of going. • The Solomons were struck by major earthquakes in 2007 and 2013, both were followed by tsunami. • Walkabout Long Chinatown, a Pijin language song composed in the 1950s, is often referred to as the islands' national song. More than 95% of the population are Christian. The rest is made up of Roman Catholics, South Sea Evangelists and Seventh-day Adventists. A casual atmosphere prevails and European customs exist alongside local traditions. Informal wear is widely suitable although women often wear long dresses for evening functions. Men need never wear ties. In general, women should dress modestly and appropriately, noting that certain public areas may be exclusively reserved for men. It is customary to cover thighs. Visitors are discouraged from wearing beachwear and shorts around towns and villages. Swearing is a crime and can lead to huge compensation claims and even jail. English is the official language. Pidgin English and over 80 different local dialects are also spoken.","Semi-tropical, mainly hot and humid, with little annual variation in temperature. The wet season (November to April) can bring severe tropical storms. Tropical, lightweights and cottons are recommended. Rainwear from November to April. The larger of the islands are 145 to 193km (90 to 120 miles) in length, while the smallest are no more than coral outcrops. The terrain is generally quite rugged, with foothills that rise gently to a peak and then fall away steeply to the sea on the other side. The capital of Honiara is situated on Guadalcanal Island, which also has the highest mountain, Mount Makarakombu, at 2,447m (8,028ft). There are a number of dormant volcanoes scattered throughout the archipelago."
oceania,australia,"It’s a mystery why sun-soaked South Australia is so often overlooked by travellers. Endowed with generous helpings of culture, vitality and natural beauty, not to mention some of the best wine in the Antipodes, it’s a region that waylays those who do visit for far longer than they anticipated. It’s packed with variety too, from the wildlife-clustered greenery of Kangaroo Island to the harsh desert outback of the north. Arty state capital Adelaide is the natural focal point. Consistently ranked among the most liveable cities in the world, it’s renowned for its festivals, museums and live music scene. Locals still semi-jokingly take pride in the fact that it was founded by free settlers (there’s no convict past here) and it’s a genuinely cultured city, from its characterful cricket ground to its boulevard-style streets. It is the wider state, however, that holds the most surprises. Visitors can stay in houseboats on the Murray River, hike the mammoth folds of the Flinders Ranges, visit subterranean houses in the wild-eyed desert town of Coober Pedy or take their time evaluating the wines of the Barossa Valley. South Australia’s long coastline draws everyone from naturalists to surfers, while the region’s much-lauded seafood includes specialities such as oysters, crayfish and prawns. And while leaving the state isn’t likely to be a priority, when you do have to depart it’s worth knowing that Adelaide sits on two of the country’s most fabled train lines – catch the Indian Pacific east to Sydney, west to Perth or hop aboard The Ghan and venture through the Red Centre to Darwin. Or just stay a bit longer. 983,482 sq km (379,725 sq miles). 1.7 million (2015). 1.7 per sq km. Adelaide.","Indigenous groups had inhabited the South Australia region for between 40,000 and 60,000 years by the time the region was first recorded by a European – in this case Dutchman Francois Thijssen, who sighted the coast in 1627. Almost two centuries later, English cartographer Matthew Flinders became the first to circumnavigate the Australian mainland, and encountered a French survey team in the waters off what is still known as the Fleurieu Peninsula. It was the Brits who first established a meaningful European presence in the region, however, colonising the area for ‘free settlers’ (i.e. not convicts) – locals still take pride in this aspect of their heritage. The colony expanded over the mid-1850s, with wool, wheat, wine and copper-mining industries helping to attract skilled workers, many of them from Germany as well as Britain. It was in 1901 when, under Queen Victoria, the land of South Australia became an official state of the Commonwealth of Australia. By this time, Adelaide – which had been chosen as a propitious spot back in the 1830s after Captain Charles Sturt’s successful navigation of the Murray River – was a fully functioning and progressive city, becoming one of the first destinations in the world to grant women the vote. Tens of thousands of South Australians volunteered to fight in WWI, but the state itself suffered badly during the post-war Great Depression. Its fortunes were brighter after WWII, however, thanks in part to a large-scale migration scheme, which saw more than 200,000 overseas migrants settle here between the 1940s and the 1970s, helping to boost the economy. The state had a role in the Cold War too, thanks to the establishment of the Woomera rocket range, set up by an Anglo-Australian agreement to test atomic weapons. The same site later figured in the US-led space programme, and Australia’s first satellite was launched from the area. In an illustration of the state’s ongoing modern outlook, in 2014, Vietnam-born politician Hieu Van Le was appointed state governor, making him the first person of Asian heritage to hold such a role in Australia. One of his sons is named after South Australia’s most famous sporting son, cricketer Sir Don Bradman. Did you know? •	Several scenes from the 1985 movie Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome were filmed in and around Coober Pedy. •	Mark Twain, once a visitor here, described the Murray River as “Australia’s Mississippi”. •	The Heysen Trail, running from Cape Jervis to Parachilna Gorge, is officially Australia’s longest dedicated walking route, at 1,200km (750 miles) long.","Adelaide boasts a Mediterranean climate, perfect for enjoying the great Australian outdoors. Warm and temperate with long hot summers, short mild winters and low rainfall. The north of the state is searingly hot during the day in summer and freezing at night. One of the hottest places in the area is Coober Pedy, 863km (536 miles) northwest of Adelaide, reaching temperatures of up to 50°C (122°F). Lightweight cottons and linens in summer, warmer mediumweights in winter. Waterproofing is advisable throughout most of the year, particularly during May, June and July. Except for the state capital of Adelaide, South Australia is sparsely inhabited. It is four times the area of the UK. It is the country's driest state, a region of rocky plains and desert landscape broken by the fertile wine-growing areas, which include the Barossa Valley. South Australia stretches upwards to the Northern Territory, eastwards to Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria, and westwards to Western Australia. The countryside ranges from the beach resorts of the Adelaide suburbs including Henley and Glenelg to the vast expanses of isolated, semi-desert outback; from the craggy mountains of Flinders Ranges to the meandering Murray River. Offshore is the popular Kangaroo Island. Adelaide nestles in the foothills of Mount Lofty Ranges."
oceania,tahiti-and-her-islands,"The Islands of Tahiti are known for their laid-back vibes. Expect romantic sunsets and giant curls of turquoise breaking over reefs. Remote and pristine, the islands give you a glimpse of paradise on Earth. The first Europeans to arrive on the islands were 16th-century Spanish and Portuguese explorers. After them, the British and French took control in the 18th and 19th century respectively. Tahiti, the largest island in French Polynesia is characterised by its spectacular tropical scenery, banana groves, plantations and flowers. The isle is dominated by Mount Orohena at 2,241m (7,352ft) and Mount Aorai at 2,066m (6,778ft). You'll find plenty of colonial history on Tahiti, which became a French protectorate in 1842, and was a full colony in 1888. The other islands were annexed by the turn of the century. This status quo remained until 1946, when Polynesia was made an Overseas Territory (Territoire d'outre-mer). A revised constitution, introduced in 1977, ceded greater autonomy to the islands. For the next 20 years, Tahiti and the islands' politics were dominated by the French nuclear testing program. By the time the program ended in 1996, 193 separate explosions had been detonated, and Tahiti had become the focus of opposition throughout the South Pacific, with plenty of protesting and riots. Although the protesters failed to stop the tests, their campaign had an important political effect by linking the anti-nuclear movement and the burgeoning pro-independence movement, which had up until then been largely unrepresented in any political forum, despite the support of a large proportion of the population. In more recent years, changes have been afoot: The Islands of Tahiti gained Overseas Country (pays d'outre-mer or POM) status in 2004, and a few months later, pro-independence leader Oscar Temaru was elected. Since then, Tahiti has seen a few more presidents, with Édouard Fritch assuming office in 2014. Beyond the political questions, the Islands of Tahiti offer an idyllic getaway for holidaymakers keen on sun, sand and tranquillity. And let's be honest, who isn't enticed by that alluring package? 4,167 sq km (1,609 sq miles) - French Polynesia. 288,283 (UN estimate 2019) 67.8 per sq km. Papeete (Tahiti Island).

The British, notably Captain Cook and later Captain Bligh (of 'HMS Bounty' notoriety), and then the French, took control of the islands in the 18th and 19th century respectively. Tahiti, the largest island in French Polynesia, was made a French protectorate in 1842 and a colony in the 1880s. The other islands were annexed by the turn of the century. This status quo remained until 1946, when Polynesia was made an Overseas Territory. A revised constitution, introduced in 1977, ceded greater autonomy. For the next 20 years, the islands' politics were dominated by the French nuclear testing programme. By the time the programme ended in 1996, 193 separate explosions had been detonated, mainly on the atoll of Mururoa. In general, the French government was able to rely on the firm backing of most of the French public opinion and an often ambivalent attitude on the part of the inhabitants of French Polynesia, who were well aware of the considerable benefits of the test programme to the otherwise threadbare local economy. The tests had begun in 1966, but it was not until the 1980s that opposition to them began to assume significant proportions, following the terrorist attack by French Special Forces on the Greenpeace vessel Rainbow Warrior. By the time of the final series of tests in 1995/6, Tahiti had become the focus of opposition from throughout the South Pacific, and several riots occurred. Although the protesters failed to stop the tests, their campaign had an important political effect by linking the anti-nuclear movement and the burgeoning pro-independence movement which had so far been largely unrepresented in any political forum, despite the support of a large proportion (possibly the majority) of the population. The politics of the territory had been dominated for the previous decade by the centre-right Tahoera'a Huiraatira (TH) party, led by Gaston Flosse, allied to the French Gaullist Rassemblement pour la République (RPR), which backed French rule and nuclear testing. In more recent years, changes have been afoot: The Islands of Tahiti gained Overseas Country (pays d'outre-mer or POM) status in 2004, and a few months later, pro-independence leader Oscar Temaru was elected. Since then, Tahiti has seen a few more presidents, with Édouard Fritch assuming office in 2014. The main religion in French Polynesia is Christianity. Approximately 54% of locals belong to Protestant churches, while 30% are Roman Catholic. Around 50% of the population of the country belongs to the Maoi Protestant Church. The basic lifestyle of the islands is represented by the simple Tahitian fares (houses) built of bamboo with roofs, thatched from pandanus leaves. The culture is generally relaxed and hospitable. Local women dress in bright pareos (wraparound skirts) and men in the male equivalent, but casual dress is expected of the visitor (except in Papeete, where bathing suits and shorts are not considered suitable dress unless on the beach). A few useful tips are: • Guests should remove their shoes when entering someone's home. • When guests are invited for a meal, the hosts are not necessarily expected to eat. • Tahitians greet each other by shaking hands and/or exchanging kisses on the cheek. • Don’t touch or remove sacred stones in archaeological sites as these areas are of great spiritual importance. The official languages are French and Tahitian. Other Polynesian languages are spoken by the indigenous population. English is widely understood, mainly by islanders accustomed to dealing with foreign visitors.","Located south of the equator, The islands of Tahiti in the South Pacific enjoy a tropical climate all year round. Sea breezes keep the temperature cooler. There are two main seasons: a rainy (hot and humid) season from November to April and a dry (and cooler) season from May to October. Tahiti experiences a year-round tropical climate with the west coast (Papeete, Punaauia, Paea) sheltered from the trade winds due to the mountainous interior. The rainy (hot and humid) season, also known as Austral Summer, runs from November to April. During this period, average highs hover between 30°C (86°F) to 32° (90°F). Most rainfall occurs during this period too, with Tahiti experiencing 12 to 17 rainy days a month. There is also a risk of cyclones. The dry season, also known as the Austral winter, runs from May to October. This is a fantastic time to visit Tahiti as the weather is at its best – with average highs between 29°C (84°F) and 30°C (86°F). The average precipitation also goes from 120mm (4.7 inches) in May to just 40mm (1.6 inches) in August. Bora Bora has similar temperatures to those of Tahiti. The rainy season (November to April) sees the number of rainy days increases from six days in November to 18 days in March, before lowering to 13 days in April. The dry season (May to October) promises balmy temperatures with plenty of sunshine. The best month to visit is August with the average high at 28°C (82°F) and rainfall is at its lowest. The Marquesas Islands are closer to the equator than the rest of French Polynesia, so the climate is warmer. On the island of Hiva Oa, the average high is 30°C (86°F), while the average precipitation is 1,165mm (50 inches) a year with June being the wettest month. The Marquesas islands are out of the path of tropical cyclones, hence there is no risk of cyclones here. To stay cool during the day, lightweight cotton and linens are recommended. In the evenings, the temperature can drop slightly, so wearing an extra layer is advisable. Even in the smarter restaurants, the dress code is still casual, and sandals are acceptable everywhere. The tropical sun can be powerful – it's encouraged to wear plenty of sunblock, a sun hat and a sun-proof shirt. If you are visiting in the rainy season, make sure to have some rainwear handy. French Polynesia comprises 118 islands and atolls divided into five archipelagos: the Society Archipelago, Tuamotu Archipelago, Marquesas Islands, Austral Islands and Mangreva Islands. The Windward and Leeward Islands, collectively called the Society Archipelago, are mountainous with coastal plains. The Windward island group consists of Tahiti, Moorea, Tetiaroa, Mehetia, and Maiao - with Tahiti being the largest of the Windward group. Tahiti is divided into two regions – the larger north-western region known as âTahiti Nuiâ or Tahiti Nui; the smaller, less developed south-eastern part is called âTahiti Itiâ or Tahiti Iti. Tahiti's landscape is characterised by lush rainforests and an array of rivers and waterfalls. The interior of Tahiti is dominated by Mount Orohena at 2,241m (7,352ft) and Mount Aorai at 2,066m (6,778ft), hence a large part is uninhabited, while the areas along the coast, including Papeete, are heavily populated. Mo'orea lies next to Tahiti, a picturesque volcanic island with white sand beaches - famous ones include Ta'ahiamanu Beach and Tiahura Beach. There are ferries serving Pape'ete (Tahiti) and Vai'are wharf in Mo'orea daily. To the west of Tahiti, the Leeward Islands (referring to a group of islands situated where the northeastern Caribbean Sea meets the western Atlantic Ocean) are generally lower in altitude. Leeward Islands include Bora Bora, Huahine, Maupiti, Raiatea, Tahaa, Manuae, Maupihaa, Motu One, and Tupai. About 298km (185 miles) east of Tahiti, Tuamotu Archipelago comprises 80 coral atolls, forming the largest chain of atolls in the world. The Marquesas Islands lie 1,497km (930 miles) northeast of Tahiti and are made up of two clusters of volcanic islands divided into a southern and northern group. The grass-covered Austral Islands south of Tahiti are scattered in a chain from east to west over a distance of 499km (310 miles)."
oceania,australia,"Ever the bridesmaid to mainland Australia, Tasmania is finally stepping out of the shadows. The only question is: how did it take so long? An archipelago of extraordinary natural beauty, tiny Tassie is similar in size to Ireland, yet it boasts a staggering diversity of landscapes; from snow-capped mountains and sweeping sandy beaches to ancient rainforest and rolling heathland. Almost a third of the island state is set aside in national parks, most notably the Tasmanian World Heritage Wilderness Area, which is home the tallest flowering plants in the world and second tallest trees – after California’s redwoods. These forests harbour distinctive wildlife, many of which are endemic species found nowhere else on Earth. The sharp-fanged Tasmanian devil – the largest carnivorous marsupial on the planet – is perhaps the most famous example. Other favourites include the duck-billed platypus, fairy penguin and wallaby. Beyond its bountiful natural assets, Tasmania is a destination of increasing cultural significance. In recent years a thriving arts scene has developed in Hobart, which gained a world-class attraction in 2011 with the opening of the Museum of Old and New Art (MONA), the largest privately-funded museum in Australia. At the same time Tasmania has emerged as one of the most exciting culinary destinations in Australasia, giving the restaurants of Sydney and Melbourne a run for their money. Its success as a gastronomic destination has much to do with the island itself; not only does Tasmania boast the cleanest air in the world, but its fertile soil and pristine oceans have conspired to provide local chefs with some of the purest ingredients available. It may be hard to believe today, but, for so long, Tasmania was mocked by mainlanders for its isolation and old fashioned ways. But as Australians and international tourists flock to the islands in increasing numbers, there’s a feeling that Tasmania is having the last laugh. 68,401 sq km (26,410 sq miles). 517,200 (2015). 7.6 per sq km. Hobart.","Aborigines first inhabited Tasmania some 35,000 years ago, when the archipelago was still connected to mainland Australia. Rising sea levels caused by an increase in global temperatures eventually cut them off, but, despite their isolation, Tasmanian Aborigines clung on to become the most southerly race on the planet. Despite surviving an ice age and the subsequent thaw, the natives could not endure the Brits, who colonised the islands in 1856 – approximately 200 years after the Dutch explorer, Abel Tasman, discovered them from the deck of his boat. Britain's colonisation of Van Diemen’s Land – as it was then known – was devastating for the aborigines, whose population crashed from 4,000 to just 200 in just three decades. European illnesses were blamed for most of the indigenous deaths, but some leading historians attribute the demise of Tasmanian Aborigines to the Black War (1828-1832), a conflict between British colonialists and the natives, during which, it is claimed, the Brits committed genocide. They weren’t much kinder to their own countrymen either; under British rule Tasmania became a notorious penal settlement for the dregs of British society. By the end of convict transportation in 1853, some 75,000 of an estimated 160,000 prisoners had been banished to Van Diemen’s Land. Approximately 12,000 wound up in the notorious prison of Port Arthur, which inmates described as ‘hell on Earth.’ Intended for re-offenders, Port Arthur’s harsh history was colourfully captured in convict era novels and films – the most famous being For the Term of His Natural Life, based on the 1874 tome by Australian novelist Marcus Clarke. In 1856 the name, Van Diemen’s Land, was changed to Tasmania, honouring the archipelago’s founder, Abel Tasman (some say this was to remove the stigma of its convict past). However, Tasmania remained part of the British Empire until 1901, when Australia gained independence. Even with the British gone, controversy has lingered in Tasmania. Since the 1970s the local government has pursued a string of environmentally unfriendly policies, which, critics say, undermines Tasmania’s reputation as a wilderness destination. Opposition to such policies led to the formation of the world’s first green party. Did you know? • Tasmania officially has the cleanest air in the world. • The last remaining Tasmanian Aborigine, it is believed, was a woman called Truganini, whose death in 1856 extinguished a race that had been around since the last ice age.  • The local government’s decision to flood Lake Pedder in the 1970s led to the formation of the world’s first green party: The United Tasmanian Group.","With four seasons, the summer tends to be warm rather than hot. Winters are wet, cold and stormy, particularly in the east. Lightweight cottons and linens in summer. Waterproof clothes are advisable in the winter. The island of Tasmania is located 240km (149 miles) south of Melbourne across the Bass Strait. Roughly heart-shaped, Tasmania is 296km (184 miles) long, ranging from 315km (196 miles) wide in the north to 70km (44 miles) in the south. The diverse landscape is comprised of rugged mountains (snow-capped in winter), dense bushland (including the Horizontal Forest, so-called because the tree trunks are bent over parallel to the ground), tranquil countryside and farmland. Approximately 40% of Tasmania is protected in national parks and other reserves, over half of this being the World Heritage-listed temperate wilderness in the west of the island."

Tonga enjoys a laidback pace of life which visitors find easy to adopt, whether relaxing on one of the magnificent white sand beaches, first-class diving amid the stunning coral reefs or watching the migratory whales return to their breeding grounds (June to November). Many of the islands are uninhabited, and have much emerald flora and secluded coves to explore. Sightseeing highlights include the Royal Palace on the waterfront in Nuku'alofa, the Mala'ekula (Royal Tombs), and the Anahulu Cave: an underground cavern of stalactites and stalagmites.

Constitutional monarchy. King George Tupou VI since 2012. Prime Minister Siaosi Sovaleni since 2021.","The ruling family of Tonga, the last remaining Polynesian kingdom, can be traced back more than 1000 years, but human habitation of the islands is thought to dates back as far as 1500BC. The first European explorers were Dutch and arrived in 1616 becoming frequent visitors by the time the British seafarer Captain Cook dubbed the archipelago the Friendly Islands in 1773. The adoption of Christianity by the ruling family which followed the arrival of Methodist missionaries in the 1820s and an overall policy of accommodation with the British – then the principal imperial power in the area – meant that the islands were not formally colonised. King Taufa'ahau Tupou I, from whom the present ruler is descended, was the first chief to rule over all of Tonga when he united the islands in 1831. He also introduced representative government to the islands during his reign. A Treaty of Friendship was signed with the British in 1879 affording Tonga the unique status of a 'protected state' (as distinct from a Protectorate, which allowed for less autonomy in government). However, although Tonga never surrendered its sovereignty, a Treaty of Friendship with the British subsequently determined its status as a protectorate in 1900. A flu pandemic killed some 1800 Tongans in 1918. King Tupou IV, the grandfather of the current king, presided over the greatest change in Tonga's constitutional status in 1968 when the islands assumed complete responsibility for internal affairs, before being granted full independence in 1970. The king pursued a uniformly pro-Western foreign policy, including (unusually for the region) expression of support for French nuclear testing in the Pacific. The legislative reforms of 2010 paved the way for Tonga to become a recognised constitutional monarchy with free elections and the pro-democracy movement campaigns for a more representative Parliament though, telling, not for the abolition of the monarchy. Tongans enjoy free education for all and access to a system of national health care. Land ownership is protected in law and sale of land to foreigners is forbidden, although it can be leased. Did you know? • Of Tonga's 169 islands, 36 are inhabited. • In 2014, luger Bruno Banani became the first athlete to represent Tonga at the Olympic Olympics in Sochi. He came 32nd in the men's luge. • Each day Radio Tonga begins broadcasting with a recording by the Tongan nobleman Ve'ehala, a celebrated virtuoso of the nose flute. Wesleyan Church, Roman Catholic and Anglican. Small denominations of Muslim, Baha'i and Mormon faiths. Shaking hands is a suitable form of greeting. Although by Western standards Tongan people are by no means rich, meals served to visitors will usually be memorable. A token of appreciation, while not expected, is always welcome, especially gifts from the visitor's homeland. Casual wear is acceptable, but beachwear should be confined to the beach. It is illegal for both men and women to go shirtless in public. Sunday is regarded as a sacred day, an aspect of Tongan life thrown into sharp relief by the controversy surrounding the so-called 'Tongan loop'. The International Date Line forms a loop around the islands, thereby making them a day ahead of Samoa, even though Samoa is almost due north of Tonga. Members of the Seventh Day Adventist Church, therefore, maintain that a Tongan Sunday is really a Saturday, and are unwilling to attend church on a day which is only a Sunday because of an apparently arbitrary manifestation of international law. This complex and almost insoluble problem may cause visitors a certain amount of confusion, but travellers to Tonga are advised to respect the religious beliefs of the islanders. Tongan and English.","Tonga's climate is marginally cooler than most tropical areas. The best time to visit is from May to November. Heavy rains occur from December to March. Tonga is an archipelago of 176 islands in the South Pacific - most of which are uninhabited - covering an area of 7,700 sq km (3,000 sq miles). The major island groups are 'Eua, Ha'apai, the Niuas, Tongatapu and Vava'u. Tonga's high volcanic and low coral forms give the islands a unique character. Some volcanoes are still active and Falcon Island in the Vava'u group is a submerged volcano that erupts periodically, its lava and ash rising above sea level forming a visible island which disappears when the eruption is over. Nuku'alofa, on Tongatapu Island, has a reef-protected harbour lined with palms. The island is flat with a large lagoon, but no running streams, and many surrounding smaller islands. 'Eua Island is hilly and forested with high cliffs and beautiful beaches. The Ha'apai Islands, a curving archipelago 160km (100 miles) north of Tongatapu, have excellent beaches. Tofua, the largest island in the group, is an active volcano with a hot steaming lake in its crater. The Vava'u Islands, 90km (50 miles) north of Ha'apai, are hilly, densely wooded and interspersed with a maze of narrow channels. They are known for their stalagmite-filled caves."
oceania,tuvalu,"Tuvalu, the world's second-smallest country and, according to the United Nations, one of the least developed, fulfils the classic image of a South Sea paradise. Visitors come to the islands to enjoy the peaceful atmosphere and palm-fringed beaches. Pandanus, papaya, banana, breadfruit and coconut palms are typical. Traditional buildings with thatched roofs can be seen virtually everywhere on the islands. Most activity is centred in the capital, Funafuti, where the greatest attraction is the enormous Funafuti Lagoon. The lagoon is 14km (9 miles) wide and about 18km (11 miles) long and is excellent for swimming and snorkelling. The second most populated island in the atoll is Funafala, which can be visited by hopping aboard the Funafuti Island Council's catamaran. There are no shops whatsoever in Funafala, so visitors should take their own provisions. 26 sq km (10 sq miles). 9,943 (UN estimate 2016). 418 per sq km. Funafuti. Constitutional monarchy. HM King Charles III since 2022, represented locally by Governor-General Tofiga Falani since 2021. Prime Minister Feleti Teo since 2024.","Formerly known as the Ellice or Lagoon Islands, Tuvalu was a slaving post a situation that, along with imported European diseases, cut the population from 20,000 in 1850 to 3000 in 1875. Two years later, the islands were taken under British jurisdiction and ruled from Fiji. In 1916, they were taken into the Gilbert and Ellice Islands and ruled as a colony, until internal self-government was granted in 1974. The islands were split from the Gilberts (which became Kiribati) in 1976, gaining independence as Tuvalu in 1978. Now the world's second-smallest sovereign state (after Nauru), Tuvalu's post-independence governments have been mostly concerned with maintaining the economy. During the 1990s, however, as the influence of global warming on the climate started to become apparent, the very survival of the country itself has become the most pressing issue. One immediate consequence of the warming is a rise in sea levels the highest point on the island group is just 5 metres (16ft) above sea level. In the last five years, several small uninhabited islands have disappeared beneath the Pacific waves after the annual cyclone season. Many of the 10,000 population are now convinced that the island group quite literally has no future. The government has an arrangement with New Zealand, under which Tuvaluans will gradually be resettled. Other political issues tend to pale into insignificance under such conditions. However, in the past, Tuvalu was very strongly opposed to French nuclear testing in the Pacific while, on the domestic front, there were heated debates on the country's constitutional future. A referendum in 1986 favoured the islands retaining their existing status of constitutional monarchy, rejecting the alternative option of becoming a republic. A treaty of friendship was signed with the USA in 1983. Despite the difficulties of running a country and an economy spread over three-quarters of a billion square kilometres with a land area of just 26 sq km (10 sq miles), Tuvalu nonetheless made substantial progress in education, health care and economic development. In September 2000, Tuvalu was admitted to the United Nations, having been one of the very few sovereign states that did not belong to the organisation. Tuvalu has no political parties and under these circumstances, individual personalities have inevitably dominated the political scene. The 1990s were dominated by two such figures Tomasi Puapua (who is now Governor-General) and Bikenibeu Paeniu who vied for the premiership through most of the decade. In July 2002, Saufatu Sopoanga emerged as the new premier. However, dissatisfaction quickly accrued and, eventually, an opposition-sponsored vote of confidence in August 2004 saw Sopoanga lose by eight votes to six. He quickly resigned and a parliamentary vote saw Maatia Toafa, former deputy Prime Minister, be inaugurated. Optimism about the future of Tuvalu persists. Approximately 98% Protestant. Traditional values continue to dominate Tuvaluan culture. Footwear should be removed when entering a church, a village meeting house (manepa) or private house. Religion plays an important part in daily life. Sunday is a day of rest and church-going for the locals, when visitors are advised to choose activities which do not cause too much disruption. There are limits imposed on the consumption of alcohol outside licensed premises. Whilst dress is usually casual, it is customary for women to keep their thighs covered and beachwear should be confined to the beach or poolside. There are procedures which should be followed by those invited to a feast and visitors should take local advice about this and other matters. It is customary not to speak a foreign language in the presence of a person who does not know it, so apparent indications of a desire to hold a private or confidential conversation should be interpreted as simple courtesy to fellow islanders. Visitors are welcome to join in the numerous local festivals and celebrations with feasting and traditional entertainment. Tuvaluan and English are the main languages.","The climate is humid and hot with a mean annual temperature of 30°C (86°F) and comparatively little seasonal variation. March to October tends to be cooler and more pleasant, whilst some discomfort may be experienced during the wet season from November to February. Lightweight for summer, rainwear for the wet season. Tuvalu (formerly the Ellice Islands) is a scattered group of nine small atolls in the western Pacific Ocean extending about 560km (350 miles) from north to south. Nearest neighbours are Fiji (to the south), Kiribati (north) and the Solomon Islands (west). The main island, Funafuti, is also the capital and lies 1,920km (1,200 miles) north of Suva, Fiji."
oceania,vanuatu,"If you can confidently point to Vanuatu on a map then you’re a better geographer than most. Drifting like flotsam in the Pacific Ocean, this little-known nation has much to offer intrepid travellers and is all the more appealing for its obscurity. Made up of approximately 83 islands, the geologically active archipelago is a natural playground of colourful coral reefs, bubbling volcanoes and lush rainforest. Visitors can drive up to the crater of Yasur, cited as the most accessible active volcano in the world, sea kayak round the islands' sandy shores, explore underwater WWII relics, or hike and bike through coconut plantations and steamy jungles. Those less disposed to physical exertion can always while away lazy days on Vanuatu’s bountiful beaches, which really are the picture of tropical island idyll. Or why not charter a boat and hop from one island to the next? Wherever you go expect a good feast: the food here is absolutely exquisite, a testament not only to talented local chefs, but also the profusion of fresh ingredients that grow on this fertile archipelago. Warm and welcoming, with a rich and sometimes mysterious traditional culture, the ni-Vanuatu people greet visitors as friends and are keen to share stories about their country, which was declared the happiest nation on the planet in 2006. The Happy Planet Index hasn’t bestowed this title on Vanuatu since, but it’s still pretty jovial by all accounts. Tourism in Vanuatu is largely centred on the islands of Tanna, Espiritu Santo and Efaté, with most international visitors arriving on the latter. From here it is easy to travel by boat or plane to the rest of the country, which caters for travellers of all stripes. Sure, it’s skewered to the well heeled, but amongst the high-end beach resorts are a smattering of wallet friendly options. Proof that paradise needn’t break the bank. 12,190 sq km (4,707 sq miles). 270,470 (UN estimate 2016). 22.3 per sq km. Port-Vila. Republic. President Nikenike Vurobaravu since 2022. Prime Minister Charlot Salwai since 2023.","Settlement in Vanuatu dates back to around 500BC. For centuries the ni-Vanuatu have recorded their history orally, passing stories from one generation to the next. Sometimes myths and events blur. For example, Roy Mata, the chief for Efate and the Shepherd Islands, died around 1265 and stories were told of his burial that his wives, close relatives and clan leaders chose to be buried alive with him. The stories were so accurate that in 1967 the digs were easy to locate and revealed the stories were true. European explorers visited the islands in the 17th and 18th centuries from various parts of the globe. In 1774, Cook sailed to Malekula, Erromango, Tanna, Santo and Efate (which he named Sandwich Island). The 19th century saw the indigenous population decimated by atrocities – slaughtered by sandalwood traders, kidnapped as cheap labour for the cane fields and the infected by missionaries who introduced many diseases. In 1906, it was decided without any consultation with the indigenous people that the New Hebrides would become an Anglo-French Condominium. This caused chaos with French and English currencies, two prisons, two hospitals, 'Bobbies' patrolling one side of the street and gendarmes the other and, for a short time, vehicles drove on both sides of the road. The early part of the 20th century saw the local people employed on low wages by white plantation owners in conditions not much better than slavery. Later, the planters recruited labour from Malaya, China, Vietnam, Fiji and Tonga, which explains today's multicultural mix. After World War 2, a complex power struggle began between the indigenous islanders and the dual colonial interests over the future political and economic course of the islands. The constitutional position was settled in 1977, at a conference between British, French and New Hebridean representatives in Paris, and the islands became fully independent in 1980 with the New Hebrides becoming the Republic of Vanuatu. Under its written constitution Vanuatu elects a President (currently Baldwin Lonsdale) as head of state, but power rests with the Prime Minister (since 2016 Charlot Salwai) who is the elected head of government and appoints a Council of Ministers. As with NiVan society, politics tend to divide along linguistic English and French lines making the formation of coalition governments somewhat troublesome. The country's legal system is based on British common law and French civil law. Did you know? • The traditional music of Vanuata is created on percussive instruments, but in the 20th century string band music became popular with its guitars, ukuleles and popular songs. • The national dish, laplap, is cooked in an underground oven. • The indigenous flying fox, or fruit bat, lays a vital role in pollinating native trees. Mostly Christian, the principal religions are Presbyterian (36.7%), Anglican (15%), Roman Catholic (15%), indigenous beliefs (7.6%), Seventh-Day Adventist (6.2%), and Church of Christ (3.8%). Informal wear is suitable for most occasions. Some establishments appreciate men wearing long trousers in the evenings. Life goes at its own pace ('island time') and while modern influences can be seen in the main centres, in some villages on the outer islands, age-old customs continue. Those hiking or exploring must be aware that Vanuatu has strict and sensitive land ownership regulations and permission should be sought before venturing onto private property. Vanuatu is also a tax haven so there is much off-shore investment. There are three official languages: English, French and Bislama (Pidgin English). Bislama, a Melanesian mixture of French and English, is the most widely used day-to-day language for the ni-Vanuatu people. Everyone involved in tourism areas speaks English and about 40% also speak French. There are more than 115 local dialects and many ni-Vanuatu people speak four or more languages.","Tropical/sub-tropical. Summer is from November to March, the average temperature is 28°C (up to 32°C) and it can be hot, wet and humid. Winter is from April to October with the temperature averaging 23°C. Sea temperature varies from 22 to 28 degrees making swimming enjoyable all year round. Rainfall is moderate and cyclones are possible, usually between December and April every couple of years. Casual, light clothing year round with perhaps a light sweater or jacket in the winter months. Outside resorts women should dress modestly. A sarong can be handy. Vanuatu is in the heart of Melanesia, with Papua New Guinea and Solomon Islands to the north, Fiji to the east and New Caledonia to the southeast. The Vanuatu Archipelago is a Y-shaped 1,300km (808 miles) and long chain of four main islands and 79 smaller islands, of which 68 are inhabited. The islands themselves are mostly mountains of volcanic origin (several of the islands still have active volcanoes) with narrow coastal plains and have a combined area of 12,200 sq km (7,581 miles) and a combined coastline length of 2,528km (1,571 miles). The Ambrym and Lopevi volcanoes are permanently active and highly dangerous. Lopevi was extinct for many years but became active 50 years ago. Further to the south, on the island of Tanna, is Yasur, cited as the most accessible active volcano in the world and a major tourist attraction. Geophysical activity is under constant monitoring by the French scientific organisation, IRD (Institut de Recherche pour le Dévelopement). Most of the islands are densely forested and mountainous with narrow bands of cultivated land along the coasts."
oceania,australia,"Victoria is Australia in miniature: the state crams snow-capped mountain country, epic seascapes, wineries, rainforests and the country's largest inland waterway into its modest borders. Not to mention, of course, the eminently lovable metropolis that is Melbourne. The state capital famously has an intense rivalry with Sydney, but even a few New South Welshmen would concede Melbourne’s claim to being Australia's cultural capital. The city – chock-full of galleries, heritage architecture, museums, sporting events and festivals – has a distinct set of passions, from Aussie Rules football (known universally as “footie”) to top-tier gastronomy. It’s no exaggeration, in fact, to state that Melbourne now stands as a world-class food destination, a status stoked by its vivid multiculturalism. But you won’t need to travel far from the city to experience what else Victoria has to share. Natural features come big and bold down here, from the Great Ocean Road (considered to be one of the best scenic drives in Australia) to the Grampians. The wildlife roster, meanwhile, makes space for wombats, wallabies, emus and everything in between. Referred to as the Garden State, Victoria ripples with rolling hills and meandering valleys – its mountains offer some of the best winter sports in the country – but the state as a whole is also somewhere rich in human history. From the age-old beliefs of the original landowners and the derring-do tales of Ned Kelly to the stirring legacy of the Gold Rush era and the pioneering winemakers of Milawa, the destination holds real rewards for those who travel beyond Melbourne and its surrounds. 227,416 sq km (87,806 sq miles). 6 million (2015). 26.2 per sq km.

Sunglasses, sunhats and sunblock lotion are recommended for most of the year. Victoria is Australia's most diverse state and its major agricultural and industrial producer. Located in the southeast, bordered by South Australia and New South Wales, its landscape consists of mountains, rainforests, deserts, snowfields, beaches, vineyards, wheatlands and market gardens. The Australian Alps are only three hours away from Melbourne and the Great Ocean Road to South Australia is a day's drive. Victoria has 32 national parks, amounting to a third of Australia's total."
oceania,australia,"The largest state in the country, Western Australia also makes credible claims to being the most handsome. Occupying the entire western third of this vast nation, it stands in stark contrast to its eastern counterparts: coastal development hasn’t occurred at the same furious pace as it has on the eastern seaboard, giving full billing to its raw national parks, relaxed coastal towns and rugged outback horizons. Western Australia’s vastness is a large part of its appeal – this is a destination that occupies travellers at length. State capital Perth is isolated from the rest of Australia’s urban centres (and the rest of the world, come to think of it), but its laidback demeanour and ultra-modern skyline is much as you’d expect from a prosperous, cosmopolitan city. Close by is the energetic port town of Fremantle, where you can come calling for the weekend markets, excellent seafood restaurants and ubiquitous cafés. Highlights elsewhere in Western Australia are nothing if not diverse. Travellers can sail with whale sharks on Ningaloo Reef, explore the majestic karri forests of Tall Timber Country, head into the stirringly feral lands of the Kimberley, sample the delicious fruits of the Margaret River wine region, take a scenic flight above the Bungle Bungles or gaze out along the never-ending sands of Broome’s Cable Beach.

It is bordered on the east by South Australia and the Northern Territory and in the west by the Indian Ocean, with the Timor Sea to the north. The west coast is nearer to Bali and Indonesia than to Sydney, making Perth a viable stopover destination en route to the rest of Australia. There are vast wheatlands, forests and deserts, and several national parks. Kimberley, in the far north, is one of the oldest geological areas on earth; time and weather have formed deep gorges and impressive mountains, arid red plains and coastal sandstone rich in fossils. In the northwest, Wolf Creek Crater, is an immense hole left in the desert by a giant meteorite 50,000 years ago, while Bungle Bungles is an ancient sandstone massif covering 3,000 sq km (1,160 sq miles). Southeast of Perth, near Hyden, is the 2,700-million-year-old Wave Rock."
south-america,argentina,"Spirited Argentina, with its clamouring capital, vast pampas, rolling wine regions and snowy peaks, is a land bursting with adventure. It’s a place where the clichés hold true: football is essentially a religion, the beef is phenomenal and there’s little point even thinking about starting a proper night out before midnight. Its natural wonders range from Andean plateaux and Patagonian glaciers to subtropical waterfalls and wildlife-rich wetlands. There’s an awful lot to love. Buenos Aires might sit at the very edge of the country, gazing out across the Rio de la Plata, but it’s very much Argentina’s centrepiece. The city of Evita and Maradona, its tango halls, parillas (grill restaurants) and feisty porteños (BA residents) provide a gutsy introduction to the country. In the high-end neighbourhoods of Recoleta and Palermo you’ll find designer boutiques and trendy eateries, while historic San Telmo offers antique stalls, old-world cafés and an abundance of live music. In the north, scorched mountains and otherworldly rock formations characterise the Salta region, where Spanish and Gaucho traditions combine and Argentina’s famous white wines flourish. Further west, in the Mendoza region, the grapes are red and the foothills of the Andes offer skiing, while down south, in Patagonia, you’ll find an astonishing spread of expansive lakes, jagged peaks and mile upon empty mile of open space. Elsewhere, try walking in the glistening Lake District, whale-watching off the coast at Puerto Madryn, meeting baby penguins in Punta Tombo or exploring the Jesuit chapels and farmhouses of Córdoba. Another of the country’s majestic natural beauties is the mighty Iguazu Falls, bordering Argentina and Brazil.  Despite living through a dark military dictatorship and a spectacularly devastating economic crisis, Argentineans still have a vivacious and infectious lust for life.

After becoming a viceroyalty of Spain in the 1770s, the territory achieved independence in 1816. Between the mid-19th century and 1946, Argentina swung from civilian to military rule, and from radical to conservative policies. A coup resulted in the rise of Lieutenant General Juan Domingo Perón as president in 1943. After winning the election of 1946, Perón instigated a policy of extreme nationalism and social improvement. At his side throughout his rise to power was his second wife, former actress Eva Perón, until her death from cancer in 1952; she remains Argentina’s most iconic female figure. President Perón was overthrown in 1955, but he was re-elected in 1973. On his death, a year later, Perón’s third wife Isabel took office, but she was deposed by a military coup in 1976. The end of the Peronista period heralded perhaps the darkest period in Argentina’s history. Driven by an obsessive fear of communism, the new military regime instituted a reign of terror in which disappearances, torture and extra-judicial murder were commonplace. This brutal era still feels very recent in today’s Buenos Aires, and the mothers of those who disappeared during the Dirty War, can be seen silently marching around Plaza de Mayo every Thursday afternoon. Argentina’s invasion of the Malvinas (Falkland Islands) in 1982, led to defeat at the hands of the British. While the topic is still a diplomatic sore point, relations between the two countries have somewhat improved. Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner succeeded her husband, Néstor Carlos Kirchner, in 2007, becoming Argentina's first elected female president. She came to power promising more of the same centre-left populist policies that had served her husband so well. Kirchner’s initial popularity waned within a few years, however, with accusations of financial corruption, followed by violent suppression of protesters against her imposed export tax hikes, bringing back horrific memories of former strong-arm governments. In the 2015 elections she lost the presidency to Mauricio Macri of the centrist Cambiemos coalition. Macri reversed some of Kirchner’s populist policies, lifting restrictions on foreign currency purchases and reducing export taxes on various agricultural products. The OECD predicts that Argentina will be out of recession by 2018. Did you know? • In 2010 Argentina became the first country in South America to legalise same-sex marriage. • Nobel Prize winning author Jorge Luis Borges famously compared the Falklands War to “two bald men fighting over a comb”. • Lionel Messi and Ernesto Che Guevara were both born in the same Argentinian city, Rosario. Argentina's population is more than 92% Roman Catholic, 2% Protestant with small Muslim and Jewish communities. The most common form of greeting between friends is kissing cheeks. It is customary for Argentines to kiss cheeks on meeting and departing, regardless of gender. Dinner is usually eaten well into the evening - from around 2100 onwards. While Argentina is famous for its wonderful wine, Argentinians as a whole do not have the same propensity for drinking large amounts of alcohol as Europeans, and in bars and even nightclubs many will be drinking soft drinks and few will appear noticeably drunk. Formal wear is worn for official functions and dinners, particularly in exclusive restaurants. A smoking ban was introduced across Argentina in 2011, it prohibits smoking in public areas, including museums, theatres, all forms of public transport, bars and restaurants. Queuing and waiting for things in public places can seem a little less ordered than in Europe; an example is the Subte in Buenos Aires – people will continue to board the carriage until the platform is empty, whether there seems to be space in the carriage or not.

The main central area is temperate, but can be very hot and humid during summer (December to February) and chilly in winter. The most pleasant times to visit Buenos Aires are September-November and February- March. The city is best avoided in January, when the heat is at its most intense and many of its residents flee to the coast leaving behind a comparative ghost city. Exploring the wilds of Patagonia is best done in the late spring and summer months – between November and February – whilst the northern regions are at their most hospitable in the spring, autumn and winter. If heading to Argentina for a ski trip, hit the slopes during mid-June to October. Lightweight clothing is generally all that is required in the north, whereas warm clothes are certainly necessary in the south, up in the mountains and during winter months in the central area. It is sensible to carry waterproofs in all areas and bring a good sunblock. Argentina is the second largest area of land in South America, separated from Chile to the west by the long spine of the Andes. Its landscape is extremely varied, with the top sub-tropical and sun-baked, and its sub-Antarctic bottom tip glistening with icy waters and glaciers. It has 3,100 miles (4,989km) of coastline. Its eastern border is the Atlantic Ocean, with Uruguay, Bolivia, Paraguay and Brazil to the north and northeast. Argentina can roughly be divided into four main geographical areas: the spectacular Andes mountain range, the dry North along with the more verdant Mesopotamia, the lush plains of the Pampas and the windswept wastes of Patagonia. Mount Aconcagua soars almost 7,000m (23,000ft), and waterfalls at Iguazú stretch out in a massive semi-circle, thundering 70m (230ft) to the bed of the Paraná River. Argentina’s lowest point is Laguna del Carbón in Santa Cruz Province, sitting 105m (344ft) below sea level. In the southwest is the Argentine Lake District with a string of beautiful glacial lakes framed by snow-covered mountains. At Argentina’s southernmost tip, and so the southernmost tip of the whole of South America, is Tierra del Fuego (Spanish for Land of Fire), a stunning archipelago split between Argentina and neighbouring Chile."
south-america,bolivia,"With its ice-capped Andean peaks, crystalline lagoons, rugged lowlands, Amazonian rainforest, terraced valleys and windswept altiplano, landlocked Bolivia is a virtual showcase of South America’s most dramatic landscapes.  Its iconic sights include Lake Titicaca, spiritual home of the Inca creation myth and highest navigable lake in the world; the Salar de Uyuni, highest and largest salt lake on earth; and La Paz, the world’s highest de facto capital. The panorama of the city’s ramshackle roofs sprawled across the basin beneath the mighty Mt Illampú is surely one of the most awesome views in the Americas. The country’s greatest treasures are the Bolivians themselves. Nearly two thirds of the people are of indigenous origin, preserving the continent’s purest cultural roots, which, for visitors, means a dazzling array of colourful festivals, mysterious rituals, haunting folklore music, magical markets and dazzling costumed dances. While bespoke tourism is emerging, there are also plenty of long bus journeys over precipitous mountain passes, rough-and-tumble jeep trips across empty landscapes and chilly nights at high altitude in budget hostels under llama wool blankets. Bolivia’s cities encapsulate the country’s staggering contrasts. La Paz mixes both traditional and modern culture in a frenzy of collisions. Weave your way through the backstreets where cosmopolitan restaurants and lively bars compete with witch markets and speeding minibuses. By contrast, Santa Cruz has a younger vibe: famous for its spirited Carnival, it’s the booming hub of the tropical eastern lowlands. Colonial Sucre and Potosí are chronicles of Bolivia’s past – whitewashed mansions, gilt-lined churches, monumental plazas, and steep cobbled streets. While Tupiza and Uyuni offer something different altogether: the isolated culture of Altiplano towns. From jungle greenery to vast white salt plains and wildlife-filled wetlands, the sweep of landscapes can be overwhelming: one day you can find yourself walking through a canyon of rock formations, the next volcanic geysers and endless stretches of white salt. It is this smorgasbord of remarkable features which keeps trips to Bolivia varied, alive and unforgettable. 1,098,581 sq km (424,164 sq miles). 10,888,402 (UN estimate 2016). 9.8 per sq km. La Paz.

The Aymara were then conquered by the Incas, who were themselves conquered by the Spanish in 1538. Throughout Bolivia’s colonial history, it was known as Upper Peru, where the population faced economic depression, exclusion from high-ranking jobs and regulations preventing trade with any countries other than Spain. This led to the Great Rebellion in 1780-82 by indigenous groups, which culminated in the Independence War in the early 1800s. Despite being the first country in South America to declare war against the Spanish, it was the last to obtain independence: Venezuelan military leader, Simón Bolívar, secured a hard-earned victory in 1825 and was rewarded by having the new country named after him. The Republic of Bolivia faced problems in its early years. War destroyed its infrastructure as well as the economy, and it was ruled by a succession of military dictators who tried, with mixed success, to unite the country's three disparate regions: the central region, the eastern Andes and the Altiplano. Wars with three neighbouring countries followed, which led to its Pacific coast being taken by Chile. In 1953, Chile declared the port of Arica 'free' and since then, has allowed Bolivia certain privileges in its use. The issue was not fully settled until 1992, when Peru agreed to allow Bolivia free use of the port of Ilo for 100 years. After an economic crisis, the Chaco War (the result of a border dispute with Paraguay) and a short rule under a military regime influenced by European fascism, Bolivia entered an era of political stability. Much of the credit is due to President Víctor Paz Estenssoro, who ruled between 1952-56, and 1960-64 and introduced universal suffrage and a national workers’ union. He was elected again in 1985, at the head of a loose coalition of both left- and right-wing parties. By the time Paz Estenssoro ceded office to Jaime Paz Zamora in August 1989, rampant hyper-inflation had been dramatically cut. Both the ADN (Acción Democrática Nacionalista) and Zamora’s MIR (Movimiento de Izquierda Revolucionaria), sometimes in coalition, have enjoyed control of the presidency and the national assembly. Leftist Evo Morales won a decisive victory in the presidential elections in 2005 against a backdrop of political turmoil and social unrest. Morales was inaugurated as Bolivia’s first-ever indigenous president in 2006, and he was re-elected in 2009. Did you know? • According to witchcraft beliefs a dried llama fetus should be buried in the foundations of new homes, to bring good luck. • Silver mine city Potosi was once the richest city in the western hemisphere. Its streets were paved with silver and its horses wore silver horseshoes. • The colourful Diablada Carnival of Oruro is based on Tiw, a devil-like deity who inhabits mines, lakes and rivers. Primarily Roman Catholic with a Protestant minority, though indigenous beliefs still hold strong with a large percentage of the population. Normal social courtesies in most Bolivian families and respect for traditions should be observed. Remember to refer to rural Bolivians as campesinos rather than Indians, which is considered deeply offensive and racist. Female campesinos still adhere to their traditional dress, while a suit and tie for men and dress for women should be worn for smart social occasions. Casual wear is otherwise suitable, with conservative clothing more appropriate for the highlands. The tropical lowlands are more liberal, especially in Santa Cruz. Smoking is accepted unless indicated otherwise. Time-keeping is poor. Remember to always ask permission before entering religious ceremonies in church or at festivals. Remember to always call people Señor or Señora if they are older than you, and greet people with a formal buenas días (good morning), buenas tardes (good afternoon) or buenas noches (good evening). Use por favor, (please) and gracias (thank you) where possible. The official language is Spanish, but the main indigenous languages you'll hear on the streets are Quechua, Aymara and Guaraní. English is often spoken by a small number of officials and business people in commercial centres, though it's best to learn simple phrases.","Bolivia has a temperate climate but temperatures can differ dramatically between day and night. The wettest period is November to March, which, in extreme circumstances, may induce landslides in mountainous areas, and cause certain roads to become impassable. The northeast slopes of the Andes are semi-tropical. During the wet season the salt flats become flooded – it is a beautiful spectacle, as the flats turn into a mirror of the sky above. Winter is perhaps the best time to visit (May-October), especially in the hot and humid lowlands, as it is cooler and drier. In the highlands, it rains much less, remains sunny through the day but gets noticeably colder at night. Visitors sometimes find the highlands (especially La Paz) uncomfortable because of the thin air due to high altitude. The mountain areas can become very cold at night. In terms of clothing, lightweight, natural fabrics and waterproofs are best. Layering is a good idea if taking the tour of the salt flats – it's extremely cold at night and early mornings, but when the sun comes out it warms up quickly. Warmer clothing is necessary at night in the Altiplano, especially in La Paz, Oruro and Potosí. If you need warm clothing, the markets of La Paz and Sucre are a good place to find alpaca wool jumpers and scarves. Landlocked by countries (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Paraguay and Peru), Bolivia is a topological pick and mix of spectacular sights, and remains one of the most bio-diverse countries in the world, despite not having a coast. The geography is largely split into the Andean Altiplano and the Eastern lowlands, and the contrast between them could not be greater. In the West, the parallel mountain chains of the Andes dominate. There’s everything from deserts strewn with cacti and soaring rock formations, to magical coloured lakes and the world’s largest salt flat, which contains 10 billion tonnes of salt (the remnants of Lake Minchin which evaporated some 25,000 years ago). You can see llama, alpaca, vicuñas (rabbit-like animals), puma, and the only bear species in South America at these heights. On top of that, expect volcanic geysers at over 4000m (13,000ft) above sea level, the world’s highest lake and the world’s highest capital, La Paz, which sits in a mountain valley with the looming Mount Illimani looking over. The high altitude can take its toll on travellers, so come prepared. Eastern Bolivia is like a completely different world. The Amazon offers all types of flora and fauna, from over 30 monkey species and giant armadillos to catfish, piranha and pink freshwater dolphins. Visit Rurrenabaque to take tours of the Río Tuichi, the Parque Nacional Madidi and the Pampas del Yacuma. The green tropical lowlands of Santa Cruz offer tropical cloudforest – try the Parque Nacional Amboró for lush beauty. The Pantanal, on Bolivia’s eastern border with Brazil is the world’s largest wetland. Over 200,000 sq km (77,000 sq miles) of ecosystems live here, including swamps, lakes, flooded freshwater grasslands and forest. It is here that you will also find the highest concentration of fauna in all the Americas – birds, anacondas and giant otters to name a just a few."
south-america,brazil,"From the jungle calls of the Amazon to the thong-clad crowds of Copacabana beach, Brazil is an intoxicating mix of the big, the bold and the beautiful, perennially one of the world’s favourite destinations. It’s also one of the largest countries on the planet, with an awesome array of treasures to match. Its vast coastline is fringed with soft sands and island getaways; the Amazon Basin teems with an unrivalled mass of flora and fauna; and the wetlands of the Pantanal, the largest on Earth, support a staggering diversity of wildlife. And then there’s the Iguaçu Falls, an unforgettable natural spectacle featuring hundreds of waterfalls, which cascade from the tropical rainforest as blue morpho butterflies flit through the spray. Undoubtedly the greatest draw, however, are the Brazilians themselves; probably the most hedonistic people on earth. Whether it’s Rio’s effervescent Cariocas going overboard at Carnival, or São Paulo’s sultry citizens gyrating in chic nightclubs, Brazilians love having fun. Their irrepressible joie de vivre finds its best outlet through music and dance. Samba, lambada and bossa nova are Brazil’s best-known musical exports, but visitors can also discover a plethora of other genres, from the Northeast’s forró to the punchy bass of baile funk coming out of Rio’s favelas. Adrenaline junkies can go wild in Brazil; shooting the big surf of Santa Catarina; bouncing in beach buggies over the sand dunes of northern Natal; snorkeling in Fernando de Noronha National Park; or abseiling in the Chapada Diamantina National Park. Or you can take life easy and let Brazil come to you by lolling in a hammock on an Amazonian ferry, looking out for the occasional macaw, or browsing the backstreets of colonial towns such as Ouro Preto and Paraty, which are lined with architectural monuments and chic boutique hotels. Whatever you’re looking for, rest assured, Brazil has it in spades. 8,515,770 sq km (3,287,957 sq miles). 210,274,356 (UN estimate 2016). 24 per sq km. Brasília. Federal Republic.

The Europeans saw great potential in a land inhabited by intransigent tribes but rich in natural resources. Despite French and Spanish resistance, the Portuguese slowly expanded their territory in Brazil, finally setting the borders of modern Brazil in 1777. In 1808, the Portuguese royal family fled the Napoleonic wars and declared Brazil the centre of the Portuguese Empire. When King João VI returned to Europe, his elder son, Pedro was crowned the first Emperor of Brazil in 1822. The tribespeople were happy to trade with the settlers, but they balked at the intensive labour imposed on them by the new plantations, especially when forced into slavery. Instead, the Portuguese brought slaves over from Africa, a trade that totalled up to 13 million over a period of 300 years, until its abolition in 1888. Towards the end of the 19th century, the monarchy was overthrown and a period of political instability began. After a number of rebellions, coups and changes of power, a brutal military dictatorship led by Getúlio Vargas, gained power in 1937. After WWII, Vargas was overthrown and the country enjoyed a period of remarkable economic growth before a democratic government was finally re-established in 1985. It was also this period that saw a further wave of immigration, begun in the 19th century, with arrivals from Europe, Japan and the Middle East. The diverse and largely harmonious cultural and racial mix that characterises Brazil today is the result of its history of settlement and integration. In 2002, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva (Lula) became president, running a widely celebrated left-wing government. He helped establish Brazil as a major international economic power whilst investing in social welfare for its poorer citizens. Lula’s successor, Dilma Rousseff, became Brazil’s first elected female president in 2011. Rousseff maintained economic stability and continued her predecessor’s socially inclusive programmes until her impeachment and removal from office in August 2016. Rousseff’s Vice President Michel Temer was named her successor and is now serving as the 37th President of Brazil.  One of the BRIC countries (newly emerging economic powerhouses, with Russia, India and China), Brazil hosted the World Cup in 2014 and the Olympic Games in 2016. Did You Know? •	Before the European conquest, there were approximately 10 million indigenous inhabitants in Brazil; today they number some 896,000. •	The geographic centre of South America is in Mato Grosso state, near the town of Santa Carmem; odd magnetic phenomena have been reported here, such as driverless cars rolling uphill. •	The Amazon River carries nearly one-fifth of all the world’s surface water. There is no official religion, but approximately 64% of the population are Roman Catholic, with another 22% Protestant. A number of diverse evangelical cults are also represented, as are animist beliefs (particularly the Afro-Brazilian religion of candomblé). In informal situations, it is common to kiss women on both cheeks when meeting and taking one's leave, whilst handshaking is customary between men. Frequent offers of coffee and tea are customary when visiting a host; if invited to someone’s home bring a gift. Flowers either before or after your visit will be appreciated, as will small gifts from your country of origin, but avoid the colour purple or black, which are associated with mourning. Time-keeping is loose and fast in Brazil, so whilst punctuality may be expected from visitors, don’t expect it in return – arriving 30 minutes later than scheduled is quite normal and acceptable. In terms of what to wear, casual wear is normal, particularly during hot weather. Brazilians are known for their love of skimpy beachwear (thong bikinis for women and Speedos for men are the norm) but going shirtless anywhere besides the beach is generally frowned upon. The official language is Portuguese, with different regional accents characterising each state. Spanish, English, Italian, French and German are also spoken, particularly in tourist areas. Four linguistic roots survive in the indigenous areas: Gê, Tupi-guarani, Aruak and Karib.","Brazil is a big country, covering 8.5 million square kilometres (3.2 million square miles) and its climate varies considerably from north to south, although it should be said that a large part of Brazil (roughly 60%) lies in the tropics. In general, Brazil is a year-round destination with temperatures rarely dip below 20°C (68°F), apart from in the mountains and southern regions. The climate varies from hot and dry in the arid interior to humid and sticky in the tropical rainforests of the Amazon jungle. Belém is the capital and largest city of the state of Pará in the country's north, as well as the gateway to the River Amazon. Belém has a tropical rainforest climate with daily mean stands at a toasty 26°C (79°F) throughout the year. The city also receives a fair amount of rain (60mm on the average) all year round. São Paulo, situated in South-eastern Brazil, is the country's the most populous city. São Paulo has a humid subtropical climate with indistinct four seasons. January is the hottest and also the wettest month, with an average temperature of 25°C (76°F) and 170mm of rainfall. On the contrary, June is the coldest month although temperatures still averaging at a comfortable 19°C (66°F). Rio de Janeiro is about 440km (273 miles) east of São Paulo but has a different climate classification. Rio's summer (December to February) can be very hot with temperatures reaching 40°C (104°F), plus the city also receives abundant rainfall. The hot and wet weather doesn’t stop millions of tourists coming to Rio de Janeiro in January or February for the annual Carnival though. Rio's winter (July and August) is still fairly warm with temperatures averaging 21°C (70°F), making it an ideal time to visit. For more information, see this weather in Rio de Janeiro guide. Curitiba is the capital and largest city of the Brazilian state of Paraná. Located 478km (297 miles) south of São Paulo, Curitiba is in the south region and has a subtropical highland climate with cold fronts bringing rains in summer (December to February) and cold winds in winter (June to August). February is the hottest month, averaging 22°C (72°F) while the average temperature drops to around 15°C (59°F) in June. Also note that parts of the south region, particularly the plateau region, it can get near 0°C (32°F) in winter. As the weather is generally on the warmer side, bring clothes made from lightweight natural fabrics such as cottons and linens which you can layer up. Waterproofs are a must if visiting during the rainy season, or places like Belém where it receives a substantial amount of rain year around. Bring warm clothing if visiting the south during winter (June to August). On the other hand, the extremely humid climate of the Amazon region demands quick-dry shirts and long cotton pants for any treks or activity tourism. Sunlight around the tropics is extremely strong, so take a wide-brimmed hat and a pair of sunglasses. Long-sleeve cotton shirts are also useful in the jungle; they protect you from mosquito bites and the sun. Brazil covers almost half of the South American continent and it is bordered to the north, west and south by all South American countries except Chile and Ecuador; to the east is the Atlantic ocean. The country is topographically relatively flat; at no point do the highlands exceed 3,000m (10,000ft). Over 60% of the country is a plateau; the remainder consists of plains. The River Plate Basin (the confluence of the Paraná and Uruguay rivers, both of which have their sources in Brazil) in the far south is more varied, higher and less heavily forested. North of the Amazon are the Guiana Highlands, partly forested, partly stony desert. The Brazilian Highlands of the interior, between the Amazon and the rivers of the south, form a vast tableland, the Mato Grosso, from which rise mountains in the southwest that form a steep protective barrier from the coast called the Great Escarpment, breached by deeply cut river beds. The population is concentrated in the southeastern states of Minas Gerais, Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo. The city of São Paulo has a population of over 12 million, while over 7 million people live in the city of Rio de Janeiro."
south-america,chile,"A narrow slither of land wedged between the Pacific and the Andes, Chile stands as a nation apart in South America – both literally and figuratively. The mountains cut the country off from Argentina and Bolivia to the east, while the expansive Atacama Desert separates it from Peru to the north. And to the south, beyond the country’s infamous Cape Horn headland, lies nothing but ocean and Antarctica. But far from being a curse, this isolation has created a very special destination indeed. Whether you fancy road-tripping the endless Carretera Austral, climbing the peaks of Torres del Paine National Park or surfing the brutal waves of Punta de Lobos in Pichilemu, Chile is deserving of its reputation as one of the world’s best destinations for adventure tourism. It’s not just for thrill-seekers, though. From its incredible night skies and Mapuche Indian heritage to its vibrant arts scene and vertiginous vineyards, this is a country that caters for travellers of all hues. The Chileans themselves, meanwhile, tend to be warm and open, so absorbing what the country has to offer is generally a joy. The country hasn’t always had it easy, of course, and the tribulations of the Pinochet era can be explored in the dynamic capital, Santiago. The city’s buzzing boulevards and arty neighbourhoods feel a million miles away from Chile’s more famous attractions, and this in itself tells you how broad the country’s offering is – this is a land that not only includes vast swathes of Patagonian wilderness and the glacier-threaded waterways of Tierra del Fuego, but also incorporates the remote, statue-studded landmass of Easter Island. Whether you’re seeking solitude as a leisurely backpacker or taking on the big sights in unbridled luxury, consider yourself warned – once you’ve experienced the myriad attractions Chile has to offer, you may find other destinations fall somewhat short. 756,102 sq km (291,932 sq miles). 18,131,850 (UN estimate 2016). 24 per sq km. Santiago. Republic. President Gabriel Boric since 2022.","Although today Chile is a democracy with a stable economy, partly thanks to its strong trade ties with the US, its history hasn’t always been harmonious. A conquered nation, like its neighbours, Chile went through colonisation in the north at the hands of the Spaniard Pedro de Valdivia, who then founded the capital Santiago in 1541. In the south, it took European conquerors more than 300 years to colonise the resisting Mapuche Indians. With civil unrest developing due to Spain’s firm trade control and domination of farm estates, Chile was finally liberated in 1818 thanks to the Argentine José de San Martín and Bernarndo O’Higgins. The latter ruled Chile for six years and established Catholicism as the nation’s religion. The regime seed had been sown, right from Chile’s birth. Generals have led military coups over the years, but the most prominent was General Pinochet, whose rule lasted 17 years until 1990. Imposing his extreme right-wing policies, Pinochet overthrew elected President Salvador Allende, killing and torturing thousands of Marxist Allende’s supporters and forcing others into exile. However, Pinochet brought economic stability and in the 1989 elections he stepped down as leader. Patricio Aylwin won with 55% of the votes and so began the slow path to democracy. Since then, ruling parties have tended to be socialist and Chile voted in its first female president, socialist Michelle Bachelet, in 2006. Her successor, Sebastián Piñera, was from the right-wing Coalition for Change party, but his presidency didn’t last long: in 2014, Bachelet regained the country’s top job. Chile has taken some hard knocks. An earthquake measuring 8.8 on the Richter scale hit in 2010 caused mass devastation. Nearly six months later, the trapping of 33 miners from a San José copper mine, and their subsequent rescue after 69 days, became a global news story. Chile staved off recession in 2009, becoming an OECD member that same year. It remains one of South America’s most stable and prosperous nations despite slow economic growth, which has averaged less than 2 per cent since the leftist government of Michelle Bachelet took power in 2014. With presidential and congressional elections scheduled for November 2017, Bachelet's left-leaning coalition has a fight on its hands to retain power against the conservative opposition. Did you know? • The Atacama Desert, in northern Chile, is the driest non-polar desert on Earth, with some parts never having had any recorded rainfall. • In the far south of the country lies the Cueva del Milodon, where 10,00 year-old remains were found of the huge, bearlike Mylodon, now extinct. • Chile is one of the world’s biggest producers of edible seaweed, with the long, tubular cochayuyo one of its most popular varieties. Christian (mostly Roman Catholic) majority with small but notable Mormon and Bahá'í Faith minorities. Chileans are often seen as more formal than others in South America. Handshaking is the customary form of greeting between men. On informal, social occasions, women usually greet friends with a single kiss on the cheek. It is very common to entertain at home and it is acceptable for invitees to give small presents as a token of thanks. Most Chileans consider themselves Catholic, and undertake baptism and first communion although they may not practise as adults. People believe in marriage and even if they are not practising Catholics, a wedding will still take place in a church. Co-habitation does exist between younger couples although it is not very common; however it is accepted. Chile was one of the last countries in the world to make divorce legal in 2004. Chileans also adhere to Catholic death rites. The official language is Spanish. Mapudungun is spoken by the Mapuche, while Rapa Nui is spoken by Easter Islanders. A small minority also speak Aymara.","Due to its long coastline, clearly Chile’s weather is extremely diverse and unpredictable although it is seasonal in much of the country. Summer runs from December to February, and winter from June to August. It is difficult to pinpoint temperatures ranges for the country as a whole as they’re so variable. There’s the dry, arid Atacama desert in the north where temperatures reach a maximum of 32°C (90°F) and can drop to -2°C (28°F). Chile’s central region has a Mediterranean feel with a cold, wet season from May to August, while it is usually always cool and damp in the south. Easter Island has its own humid sub-tropical temperatures, while much of the south, from Region VII down has a very high annual rainfall. Arica, Iquique, Antofagasta, La Serena and Coquimbo are the principal summer beach hubs in the north for local tourists, while Pucón in the south sees high tourism numbers from January to March. Due to its proximity to Santiago, Viña del Mar and Valparaíso beach areas see plenty of sunshine and beach bums during the summer, often filling up with neighbouring Argentinians. As Chile is in the southern hemisphere, the ski season takes place between June and August. In terms of visiting Patagonia and south, the summer months from December to March are ideal as it is warmer for trekking and other outdoor activities. November and April are quieter times in terms of tourism but the weather is less dependable. It isn’t advisable to visit the south from the end of autumn to the end of winter - May to September - as many trails close due to bad weather and strong winds and waterways ice over. However, places in the north, such as the Atacama, can be visited all year round. If visiting the cities, bring lightweight, natural fabrics that can wick away sweat easily. During the wet season, you’ll need to bring waterproofs – aim for breathable materials so you don’t overheat. More substantial waterproofs and warm weather clothing are often needed in the south and at altitude. Chile is situated in South America, bordered to the north by Peru, to the east by Bolivia and Argentina, to the west by the Pacific Ocean and to the south by the Antarctic. The country exercises sovereignty over a number of islands off the coast, including the Juan Fernández Islands and Easter Island. Chile is 4,329km (2,690 miles) long and nowhere more than 180km (112 miles) wide. The Andes and a more westerly coastal highland range run parallel with each other for much of the country's length. The coastal range forms high, sloped cliffs into the sea from the northern to the central area. Between the ranges runs a fertile valley, except in the north where transverse ranges join the two major ones, and in the far south where the sea has broken through the coastal range to form an assortment of archipelagos and channels. Wide variations in soil and a vast difference in climate are reflected in an uneven population distribution, and in a wide range of occupations. The Atacama desert, the driest in the world, is in the northern part of the country, which is also the main mining area. The central zone is predominantly agricultural, and is often referred to as the breadbasket of Chile. This is where the two-thirds of the population reside. Below Concepción, there are large tracts of forested land, although the area also has some agriculture. Chile is prone to frequent powerful earthquakes as the Liquine-Ofqui Fault lies just under the northern Patagonian Andes and runs for 1000km (621 miles)."
south-america,colombia,"Since emerging from decades of civil unrest, Colombia has established itself as one of the world’s top destinations. And rightly so: this exquisite South American nation is blessed with natural beauty – think high Andean peaks, Caribbean beaches, pristine Amazon jungle – not to mention mysterious archaeological sites, colonial treasures and thriving cities. It’s a joy to travel around. At the heart of it all is Bogota, the pulsating capital. Once synonymous with drug cartels and gangs, the city has recast itself as one of South America’s trendiest destinations; a place of hip bars and street art, vibrant markets and colourful architecture. Sprawled across the Andean plateau, Bogota offers a fabulous mix of old and new; the cobbled streets of La Candelaria offer a stark contrast to the urban chic of Zona Rosa. But it works. Elsewhere, Colombia’s colonial towns have been lovingly preserved, most notably the UNESCO-listed city of Cartagena. But don’t stop there. Other historic settlements also warrant a visit, amongst them the cities of Mompós, Villa de Leiva and Barichara. The mysterious “lost city” of Ciudad Perdida is also worthy of a detour, but you may leave with more questions than you arrived with. The more you travel around Colombia, the more you marvel at its diversity. While the Caribbean and Pacific shores boast beautiful beaches, islands and coral reefs, the lofty Andes offer high-altitude plains, snow-capped mountains and limpid lakes. Then there are the eastern lowlands with their grassy wetlands and bountiful birdlife, not to mention the virgin forests of the Amazon. Colombian culture is no less magical. Garcia Marquez’s land of magic realism is alive with festivals and music; the high-energy city of Cali is recognized as the salsa capital of Colombia, while bustling Barranquilla hosts a dazzling carnival to rival Rio’s. To cap it all off, visitors can expect a warm welcome from the country’s friendly inhabitants, who, after years in the wilderness, can finally show their true colours. And what a picture they paint. 1,141,748 sq km (440,831 sq miles). 48,829,027 (UN estimate 2016). 43.9 per sq km. Bogotá. Republic. President Iván Duque Márquez since 2018. President Iván Duque Márquez since 2018.","Prior to the Spanish invasion, the land comprising modern-day Colombia was ruled by various Amerindian tribes who traded with each other and established their own civilisations. The two main tribes were the Taironas, who were largely based in the Caribbean, and the Muiscas, who were settled in the highlands around Bogotá. To this day, indigenous peoples who have descended from the Taironas live in Tairona National Park. Now named after Christopher Columbus, Colombia in its present form has only existed since the 1800s. The Spanish conquistadors grouped it with modern-day Venezuela, Ecuador and parts of Brazil and Central America; they called this vast territory New Granada and ruled it from Europe. The desire for independence soon followed, however, when discontent among mixed-race Creoles, lower-class Spanish immigrants and indigenous people spread, here and all across the continent. This eventually led to the 1819 rebellion under the legendary figure of Simón Bolívar, which resulted in the area being split into the four provinces of Gran Colombia: Panama, Ecuador, Colombia and Venezuela. Colombia separated from the others soon after Bolívar's death in 1830. The Republic of Colombia was formally established in 1855, four years after the abolition of slavery. Over the next 100 years, politics were dominated by the Conservative-Liberal feud, which often broke out into warfare. Occasionally, however, the two parties united against a common threat. This occurred in 1970, when they prevented a bid for power by the Alianza Nacional Popular (ANAPO), led by former dictator, General Rojas. Colombia has since had to handle various guerrilla movements against the government, such as from disaffected members of ANAPO, the Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia (FARC, Colombian Revolutionary Armed Forces) and the Ejercito de Liberacion Nacional (ELN, National Liberation Army). The 1980s saw drug traffickers become a potent force in Colombia: large sums of money turned into political power, and leading politicians increasingly became tainted by their connections with drug money. Successive US governments, having pinpointed Colombia as the principal source of drugs flowing into the USA, put increasing pressure on the Colombians to fight the 'war on drugs'. In 2000, the US Clinton administration unveiled Plan Colombia, a controversial initiative aimed at fighting cocaine cartels and left-wing insurgents. This included the aerial fumigation of coca plantations, which destroyed the crops of innocent farmers and has been blamed for birth defects in rural communities. Over the last decade, Colombia has undergone a remarkable transformation: the guerrillas have – mostly – accepted peace agreements and drug-related violence has fallen; tourism is once again booming. In September 2016, President Juan Manuel Santos signed an historic peace agreement with Colombia's leftist FARC rebels to end the country's 53-year conflict. Did you know? • Infamous drug lord Pablo Escobar reportedly offered to pay Colombia's national debt of $10bn to improve his reputation. • Colombia is the self-proclaimed cycling capital of South America; Bogotá has more than 250km (155 miles) of dedicated bicycle routes. • The town of Yarumal has the world’s highest incidence of Alzheimer’s, described in 100 Years of Solitude by writer Gabriel Garcia Marquez, who was himself a victim of the disease.

Casual clothes can be worn in most places; formal attire will be necessary for exclusive dining rooms and social functions. Smoking is allowed except where indicated. The official language is Spanish, though there are more than 80 other languages and dialects recognised in the country, belonging to various indigenous peoples. In the San Andrés and Providence Islands, English is also an official language.","Colombia’s weather offers all four seasons and they remain generally unchanged throughout the year due to Colombia’s proximity to the equator. The topographical diversity of Colombia means that you will find snowy mountain peaks, warm Caribbean beaches and a rainy tropical rainforest at any time of year. This makes the Colombian climate extremely unique and attracts an increasing number of visitors annually. Bogota, the largest city and capital, is situated in the Eastern Andes region and the weather is generally spring-like. Although sunny days can still get quite hot, there are many cool days and nights. The average high temperature throughout the year hovers around 20°C (68°F). For more information about weather in Bogota and things to do there, check out our Bogotá guide. Located in Northern Colombia on the Caribbean coast, Cartagena is another popular spot for tourists. It is a port city known for rich history and beautiful beaches. With temperatures rarely dropping below 30°C (86°F), Cartagena’s climate is perfect for those looking for a warmer, relaxing vacation. You can learn more about Cartagena here. The Amazon region is a place where tourists go to explore the jungle and marvel at the unique species of plants and animals. Located in southern Colombia, the Amazon basin generally stays warm all year round and finds little relief from rain. Although the seasons are unchanging, the best time of year to visit Colombia is December to March. These are the drier months and allow tourists to enjoy more outdoor activities. Major religious holidays will also impact the best time of year to visit. Santa Semana, Holy Week in April, is a stunning time to travel to Colombia. There are ostentatious celebrations and candle-lit mass services to celebrate the Catholic faith. But, hotels book up fast for this week and double their rates, so it is smart to plan in advance. Generally, Colombia’s weather requires light clothing suitable for warm to hot weather. However, if you are staying in a city in the Andes such as Bogotá, long shirts and pants are recommended – preferably a jacket as well. If you are planning to hike in the colder mountainous regions you’ll need durable boots. Breathable walking sandals with good support are recommended for more rural areas. If you are visiting the Amazon, light clothing is required, but long sleeves and trousers for the evenings are useful to prevent mosquito bites. No matter where you are staying, a waterproof jacket is smart to bring for any time of year. Colombia is situated in South America, bordered by the Caribbean Sea, the Pacific Ocean and Panama on the North, Ecuador and Peru on the South, and Venezuela and Brazil on the east. Colombia is home to the Andes, the world’s longest above-water mountain range. The Western and Central Cordilleras of the Andes Mountains are in the west of Colombia – stretching from Ecuador to the Caribbean Sea. The Eastern Cordillera, the longest range, rises northeast from Ecuador to Venezuela. Colombia is divided into three different climatic zones based on elevation. The Tierra Caliente, meaning hot land, is the region below 900 meters (2,953 ft) in elevation. This region spreads over about 86% of the total area of Colombia. The Tierra Templada, meaning temperate land, ranges between 900 to 1,980 meters (6,496 ft) in elevation and is home to most of the country’s population. The area located between 1,980 and 3,500 meters (11,483 ft) is called The Tierra Fria, meaning cold land. The mean range of temperature there is between 10 and 19°C (50 and 66.2°F). The combined area of the flat grassy prairies in eastern Colombia and the jungles and towering rainforests of the Amazon in the south covers nearly 55% of Colombia, yet only 3% of Colombians live there. The tallest peak in Colombia is actually not in the Andes but found in a separate mountain range. It is Pico Cristobal Colon in the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta range and has an estimated height of 5,775 metres (18,950 ft)."
south-america,ecuador,"Tiny by South American standards, Ecuador is packed with an amazing range of natural and cultural attractions; a microcosm of everything that is appealing about this fascinating continent. Tucked between Colombia and Peru, Ecuador outdoes its heavyweight neighbours because of, rather than despite, its size. In a single day you could take an early morning safari in the Amazon, drive up through a valley of active volcanoes and past verdant cloud forest before winding down to the Pacific coast in time for a seafood dinner. Bisected by the equator (hence the name), Ecuador is divided into three distinct regions – Costa, Sierra and Oriente. The coast, or Costa, is hot and dry with sandy beaches, rolling surf and lively Afro-Ecuadorian towns. The mountainous centre, or Sierra, is a place of snow-capped Andean peaks, colonial towns and vibrant local markets. And the tropical lowland, the Oriente, which takes in parts of the Amazon, is home to innumerable species of wildlife and indigenous inhabitants. In addition, Ecuador controls the Galapagos Islands, a wildlife-rich archipelago in the Pacific Ocean, where Charles Darwin developed his theory of evolution. At the heart of all this is Quito. As well as laying claim to being the world’s second highest capital city (after La Paz in Bolivia) this lofty metropolis has the best-preserved historic centre in Latin America, not to mention an excellent culinary scene, vibrant nightlife and string of world-class cultural attractions. However, it’s Ecuador’s natural beauty that draws in the crowds. Visitors flock from around the world to admire the wildlife, particularly on the Galapagos Islands, which is home to giant tortoises, whale sharks, sea lions and many more. For those seeking an adrenalin hit, world-renowned scuba diving, exceptional trekking and breathtaking climbing is rarely far away. Whether you explore it on two wheels or four hooves; on a raft, kayak or surfboard, Ecuador is a joy to get to know. 283,560 sq km (109,483 sq miles). 16,385,450 (UN estimate 2016). 66 per sq km. Quito. Republic. President Daniel Noboa since November 2023.","As you would expect from a land peppered with ancient Inca sites and colonial cities, Ecuador has a colourful history. It began in earnest with the arrival of the Incas in the mid-15th century, who conquered the various tribes that had previously eked out a livelihood in northern South America. The sun-worshipping Incas developed advanced cities such as Ingapirca, the ruins of which still stand today, but they couldn’t fight off the Spanish, who conquered the region in the 1530s. The territory fell under the jurisdiction of Gran Colombia, a Spanish state that incorporated Colombia, Venezuela, Peru, Panama, Brazil and Guyana. Spanish rule lasted until the early 19th century; the Spaniards were finally overthrown in 1822, by a force backed by Simon Bolivar, fresh from victory in Colombia. In 1828, the country declared war on Peru, whose armies had invaded Gran Colombia. A year later, a peace treaty was signed. In 1831 Gran Colombia was dissolved and Ecuador's boundaries were permanently established. However, relations between Ecuador and Peru have been tense ever since. The period between 1925 and 1948 was characterised by continual changes of government, administrative chaos and economic hardship. The discovery of oil and the sharp increase in world oil prices in the 1970s should have transformed Ecuador's economic fortunes, but the windfall was largely squandered. After years of military rule, Ecuador had its first presidential elections in 1979. Power swung between left and right for the next two decades, until 1998 when Jamil Mahaud, of the centre-right Popular Democracy Party took office. However, he proved unable to arrest Ecuador's deteriorating economic situation, which included the freefall devaluation of the Sucre and a proposed switch to the US Dollar in a desperate bid for stability. In January 2000, Mahaud was forced out under pressure from the military. Under strong international pressure, his successor, Gustavo Noboa, introduced an unpopular austerity programme, which destroyed his prospects for retaining office. Rafael Correa, took office in 2007 and has since presided over a period of relative stability, investing heavily in infrastructure projects, education and welfare. However, his populist policies have been largely funded by oil, which has tumbled in value recently and left gaping holes in Ecuador’s budget. Correa’s treatment of political opponents and the media have also raised questions about his presidency. In 2017, Lenín Moreno - who served as Vice President under Correa from 2007 to 2013 - clinched a narrow victory in a contenous presidental election, with a promise to triple poverty relief, tackle corruption and ease up on the media. Did you know? • In 2008 Ecuador became the first nation in the world to declare that nature has constitutional rights. • Quito and Krakow became the first World Cultural Heritage Sites in 1978. • President-elect Moreno will become the world's first paraplegic head of state when he is sworn in on 24 May 2017. Christianity, with 95% Roman Catholic. Casual wear is widely acceptable, other than for business. Smart clothes are often required when visiting hotel dining rooms and better restaurants. Revealing clothes should not be worn in towns.Photography: A tip may be requested if you wish to take someone's photograph and it is better to seek permission first. Spanish is the official language, but Quichua (Kichwa) and other indigenous languages are common.","Ecuador has a highly changeable climate, which means that it can be variable at any time. Generally though, in the Sierra, there is little variation by day or by season, with changes occurring as you climb or descend instead. The coastal and Amazonian lowlands have a wet equatorial climate, but the higher you climb the colder it gets. Rainfall is primarily affected by proximity to the eastern or western slopes of the Andes; in the west, June to September are drier with October to May typically wetter; in the east the opposite is true with October to February drier and March to September much wetter. There is also a variation in the amount of rainfall as you journey north to south, with the southern highlands much drier than the landscapes in the north. The coast can be enjoyed all year round, although it is cooler between June and November, when a sea mist known as garua sets in. January to May are consistently the hottest and rainiest months here. The Galapagos are also affected by garua between May and December; January to April here are the hottest months, with heavy but brief rainfall also possible. In the Oriente you can be affected by rainfall at any time, but it is wettest from March to September. Most cities are located in a comfortable subtropical zone. Taking all of this into account, Ecuador’s high season is June to early September. There is a shorter tourist season from December to January as well. However, the country is still not overly busy at any time and it’s easy to engineer an escape from the crowds. The Galapagos however are often very busy and you must book well in advance to visit. Lightweight natural fabrics; rainwear in subtropical areas. Warmer clothes are needed in upland areas. Make sure that you have good-quality, well-broken boots with plenty of ankle support for trekking or walking on uneven terrain. Ecuador comprises a number of very distinct, dramatic geographical regions. The Andes run north-south through the country and form a mountainous spine with a number of peaks over 5,000m (16,404 ft) and some climbing to 6,500m (21,325ft). There are two main ranges, the central Cordillera and the Western Cordillera, which are separated by the Central Valley. At 400km (249 miles) long, the valley is just 50km (31 miles) wide. Its two rims are connected by a series of high plateaux that are separated by a series of gentle ridges. Rivers from the peaks run east to the Amazon and west to the Pacific Ocean. The rims of the valley are crowned with the cones of more than 50 volcanoes, many of which are active. The highest is Chimborazo at 6,310m (19,685ft), although this behemoth is now extinct. Cotopaxi is the highest active volcano in the world at 5,897m (19,347ft) but hasn’t had a major eruption since the 19th century. Pichincha on the other hand issued an enormous mushroom cloud in 1999, Reventador has erupted several times sine 2002 and Sangay continuously fumes and emits ash. Earthquakes are also common in this region. The Sierra, or central highlands, is a central trough. Home to almost half the population, it is also where the oldest and most important cities are situated. The Costa, or coastal plain, in contrast is a lowland area with a belt of hillier ground north of Guayaquil. In the extreme north there is tropical rainforest, whilst in the south the forest thins out and becomes tropical dry forest. East of the Central Cordillera the forest-covered slopes descend into the jungle of the Oriente. This vast region comprises about a third of Ecuador’s total surface area but is very sparsely populated and in fact home to just 5% of the population, most of whom are indigenous Indians or adventurous agriculturalists. The Galapagos Islands lie 1,000km (621 miles) to the west of Ecuador, on the equator. These atolls are in fact the tips of massive volcanoes jutting above the sea and mark the point where two tectonic plates meet. Several of the islands are still active today; Fernandina, which last erupted in 2009, is the most active here. This extreme isolation is what has allowed the evolution of the unique flora and fauna found here."
south-america,falkland-islands,"Nineteenth-century shipwrecks and a plethora of marine life are among the attractions awaiting visitors to the Falkland Islands. Although these islands are perhaps best known as the battleground of the eponymous 1982 war between Britain and Argentina, but this archipelago in the Atlantic is an intriguing and relaxing holiday destination. Situated nearly 500km from Patagonia, the Falklands – or Islas Maldivas, depending on who you talk to – are a frequent stopping point on Antarctic voyages, and with such an abundance of rare animal life, it's not hard to see why. There are two main islands, East and West Falkland, as well as several hundred islets. Wildlife lovers will find strewn among them five different species of penguins (including macaroni, king, Magellanic, gentoo, and rockhopper), as well whales, and sea birds. Head to Volunteer Point for the islands' largest group of king penguins, while there are a predictably vast amount of sea lions to be found on Sea Lion Island. Reminders of the 1982 conflict do remain, with battlefields, such as Goose Green and Pebble Island, now tourist attractions. Also claimed by Spain, France and Argentina over the years, the Falklands have been British Overseas Territory since 1833. Argentina famously still contests this status and there have been recent political ramblings on the matter by that country's government. However, a recent referendum found that an overwhelming majority of the 3,000 or so islanders want to remain under British rule. Most of the Falkland Islands' population live in the capital Stanley, over whose harbour much avian life can be seen circling above the waves. More than a thousand members of the British military live at the Mount Pleasant Base. There's a rural feel to the islands, with hamlets and sheep abounding, while you'll find no traffic lights on the Falklands' country roads. There are more than a dozen endemic plants, including Felton's flower, thought to be extinct in the wild until recently, which gives off a whiff of caramel. Also, look out for the ubiquitous snakeplant. 12,173 sq km (4,700 sq miles). 2,912 (UN estimate 2016). 0.2 per sq km. Stanley. British Overseas Territory, which is not recognised by Argentina, as it considers the Falkland Islands to be part of Argentina. HM King Charles III since 2022, represented locally by Governor Alison Blake since 2022.","Until the war of 1982, the rainy, windswept Falkland Islands were a lowly, almost forgotten remnant of the old British Empire. First occupied by the French in 1764, the islands were quickly ceded to Spain, which then ruled the adjacent territory in Latin America. However, the Spanish only established themselves on West Falkland and, in 1765, the British took control of the eastern island. There are a further 776 smaller islands. By 1816, due to the islands' inclement climate and strategic uselessness, both powers had removed their respective garrisons and the Falkland Islands had no permanent inhabitants. In 1820 a vessel from newly independent Argentina was sent to establish a permanent settlement, but was driven out by a British expedition in 1832. When the British declared full sovereignty over the Falkland Islands the following year Argentina refused to recognise the claim and has asserted its own right to sovereignty ever since. This claim was pursued periodically through diplomatic channels until 1982, when an Argentine force overran the British garrison and established a military base on 'Islas Malvinas', a name derived from the original French settlers, who named the islands after their homeport of St Malo. After negotiation failed, a British task force, which had been despatched at the start of the crisis, was ordered to continue its journey and engage the Argentines. Argentina surrendered 10 weeks after the invasion. In the subsequent contact between the two governments, it has become apparent that the issue of sovereignty is a stumbling block and that the Falkland Islands issue has remained a key aspect of Argentine foreign policy. The UK adamantly refuses to discuss sovereignty and the wishes of the 3000 or so islanders, who are determined to stay British, remain paramount. Since 1983 the islanders also enjoyed full British citizenship. The Islands' weekly newspapers The Penguin News is published every Friday and made its own headlines in 2012 when it appeared to insult the then Argentine President Cistina Fernández de Kirchner in a photo caption. Did you know? • It is thought indigenous Fuegians from Tierra del Fuego may have visited the Falkland Islands in prehistoric times. • Following the 1982 war, some 20,000 mines of various types were left. Following several casualties, clearance work was abandoned in 1983 and not resumed until 2009. • The Falklands' only native terrestrial mammal, the warrah, had been hunted to extinction by 1876. Christian, with Catholic, Anglican and United Reformed Church of Stanley denominations. The lifestyle in the Falkland Islands resembles that of a small English or Scottish village/town and communities on the Falkland Islands are highly self-contained. The influx of the British Forces has obviously had an effect on the Islands. More people now visit for a variety of reasons. The islanders themselves have benefited from the additional amenities offered by the Forces. The population is very keen to remain under British sovereignty. English.","The climate is temperate and largely conditioned by the surrounding sea being cooled by the Antarctic Current. The most popular time to visit is between November-February, when the weather is at its warmest. A windproof jacket is essential, as is a stout pair of walking boots when crossing the rugged terrain. Because the air is so clear and unpolluted, suntan lotion is advisable. The Falkland Islands are located 560km (350 miles) off the east coast of South America and consist of two main islands and hundreds of small outlying islands, amounting to approximately 1.2 million hectares (3 million acres). Generally, the main islands are mountainous, with low-lying and undulating terrain in the south of East Falkland. The highest mountain is Mt Usborne at 712m (2,312ft)."
south-america,guyana,"Guyana might not be on everyone's bucket list, but with its unspoiled rainforests, golden beaches, sweeping savannahs and meandering rivers, this little-known South American nation offers rich rewards for those daring enough to visit. Wild and welcoming in equal measure, Guyana's attractions range from the awesome natural splendour of Kaieteur Falls, to the charming, stilted wooden houses of its capital, Georgetown. Jungle trekking, freshwater fishing and wildlife watching are the big draws, and while few succeed in sighting the country's famously elusive jaguar's, nature lovers will have the opportunity to spot giant anteaters, giant otters and, sticking with the supersize theme, arapaima, the world's largest freshwater fish. In many ways a trip to Guyana is a jump back in time, a refreshing tonic in a world of instant gratification and constant connectivity. But while the country's tourist infrastructure is almost non-existent, ATMs scarce and holidaymakers rarer than the wild cats that roam the rainforests, pioneering travellers certainly won't be left wanting. One of the few Caribbean countries that is not an island, multicultural Guyana has more in common with the West Indies than it does South America; from the English and Creole spoken on the streets to the curry dishes served on dinner tables. Guyanese culture and cuisine reflect the ethnic makeup of the country, which consists of Indian, African and European people, who were brought over to the Caribbean by Dutch and British colonialists. There is also a substantial Amerindian population, which distinguishes it from other parts of the Caribbean. Travellers looking for a destination with a difference, a country well off the tourist trail, will find Guyana a joy to discover. It's by no means cheap to fly there and exploring the country will require a strong sense of adventure and a willingness to forsake creature comforts. But that's a small price to pay for what Guyana gives in return. 214,969 sq km (83,000 sq miles). 770,610 (UN estimate 2016). 3.4 per sq km. Georgetown. Republic. President Irfaan Ali since 2020. Prime Minister Mark Phillips since 2020.","Modern day Guyana is built on the legacy of European imperialists, who made their first foray into the region in 1499, when Alonso de Ojeda sailed up the Essequibo. Prior to the arrival of the Spanish, the Arawak and Carib people had been fighting for control of the region, but when the Spanish arrived, the victorious Carib warriors proved defenceless against the heavily armed Europeans, who discovered the area had no gold and gave the land back to the natives. In 1616 the newly independent Dutch founded a trading post in current day Guyana and rapidly expanded their settlements inland, changing their original aim from trading with the natives, to conquering them. For more than 170 years the Dutch named the colony Essequibo and used it mainly as a trading base for locally grown tobacco, exporting some 15,000 kilos in 1623. When the Dutch West India Company took complete control of the colony, business changed from trading tobacco to trading African slaves, until the Berbice slave uprising of 1763, during which time plantations rapidly fell to the Africans. The British and French marched in to quash the uprisings from neighbouring colonies, thus laying the path for an eventual majority British population. During the French Revolutionary Wars, when Napoleon’s forces occupied the Netherlands, Britain conquered all Dutch colonies in the Americas, including Guyana. This British control was legitimised by the signing of the London Convention of 1814, at which France agreed to allow Britain to control the newly unified British Guiana. Successive Governors of the colony repeatedly complained to London about the lack of able-bodied workers to complete grand public works, so paid workers were imported from British India in their shiploads, thus resulting in an un-proportionately sized Indian population calling Guyana home. In 1950, Indian-Guayanese Cheddi Jagan and Afro-Guyanese Forbes Burnham founded the first political party in the country, the Progressive People’s Party (PPP) which campaigned for independence from Britain, which was granted in 1966. After independence, Forbes Burnham was elected to power, but his premiership saw border disputes with Venezuela and Suriname grow. Burnham took Guyana from a pro-imperial right-wing to a left-leaning pro-communist country, developing ties with Cuba. Successive left-wing governments neglected Guyana’s potential oil and gas reserves until Desmond Hoyte took power and embraced the free market, elections and independent media. Did you know? • There are more Indian descendants in Guyana than in some of the northern states of India. • During Jagan’s premiership, the country was blighted by strikes and rioting, often attributed to covert CIA operations from the US who were trying to prevent Guyana from turning communist. • In 1978, American religious cult leader Jim Jones and 909 followers (including 300 children), of the People’s Temple committed mass suicide in Jonestown, Guyana. 50% Christian, 33% Hindu, less than 10% Muslim. Hospitality is important to the Guyanese and it is quite common for the visitor to be invited to their homes. Informal wear is widely acceptable, but men should avoid wearing shorts. English is the official language, but Creole, Hindi, Urdu and Amerindian dialects are also spoken.","Guyana's climate is warm and tropical throughout the year. The rainfall is generally high for most of the year, as is the humidity. December to January and May to June are the rainy seasons, while in coastal areas the climate is tempered by sea breezes. Guyana lies in the northeast of South America, bordered by Venezuela to the west, Surinam to the southeast and Brazil to the south. It is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the north and east. The word 'Guiana' (the original Amerindian spelling) means 'land of many waters' and the name was well chosen, for there are over 1,600km (965 miles) of navigable rivers in the country. The interior is either high savannah uplands (such as those along the Venezuelan border, called the Rupununi, and the Kanuku Mountains in the far southwest), or thick, hilly jungle and forest, which occupy over 83% of the country's area. The narrow coastal belt contains the vast majority of the population, and produces the major cash crop, sugar, and the major subsistence crop, rice. The country has 322km (206 miles) of coastline. More than 25% of the population lives in or near Georgetown."
south-america,paraguay,"There’s a saying in Paraguay that people who visit always cry twice – once when they arrive and once when they leave. And you can see why emotions might run high in this lesser-travelled South American nation, whose beautiful, beguiling and baffling character is made all the more alluring by its relative obscurity. After years in the wilderness – Paraguay has long been politically as well as geographically isolated – the country is gradually opening up to the outside world. Its tourism infrastructure remains undeveloped, but patient and pioneering travellers are rewarded for their endeavours. Boasting an intoxicating blend of crumbling colonial cities, exotic natural wonders and indigenous tribes, visitors to Paraguay can also expect a warm welcome from the locals, who are unerringly polite, interested in outsiders and liberal with their dinner invitations (expect football chat to be on the menu). Most travellers begin their Paraguayan adventure in the capital, Asuncion. A charming, colonial city, it’s one of South America’s more endearing capitals and is blessed with neoclassical façades, pretty piazzas and tree-lined boulevards. It is also a place of contradictions; expensive sports cars whizz along crumbling cobbled streets, while traditional street vendors ply their trade in the shadows of modern shopping malls. Inequality is hard to ignore. Outside the capital, Paraguay’s true beauty is revealed. The east is characterised by sweeping savannahs and dense forests, which are peppered with sleepy colonial towns barely changed since the turn of the 20th century. Crumbling Jesuit missions and yerba maté plantations can be found in the southeast corner, while the largely unexplored northern region is blanketed by steamy marshes, shimmering lagoons and dense rainforests, which harbour exotic species such as the elusive puma. And then there’s the wild, western region of Chaco; one of South America's great wilderness areas, it is home for many of Paraguay’s indigenous people, who live largely traditional lives amongst a myriad of spectacular flora and fauna. 406,752 sq km (157,048 sq miles). 6,725,430 (UN estimate 2016). 16.7 per sq km. Asunción. Republic. President Santiago Peña since 2023.","Like much of South America, the territory of present day Paraguay was once a stomping ground for semi-nomadic indigenous tribes, who jostled for space and resources in the region for thousands of years. And then came the Spanish, who built Asunción in 1537 and established an overseas province called Paraguay. What follows is a familiar tale of European colonialism – enslavement of indigenous people, forced Christianity – which ended when the Paraguayan people overthrew the Spanish administration and declared independent in 1811. Dictatorships followed, starting with Paraguay’s first leader, José Gaspar Rodríguez de Francia. Despite ruling with an iron fist, he allowed the country to prosper economically and socially, a legacy that continued with his successor Carlos Antonio López. And then there was a war. Dubbed the War of the Triple Alliance (1865-1870), this bloody conflict engaged Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay and Paraguay, and saw the latter lose two thirds of its male population and vast swathes of land. The country was in ruins. Paraguay barely had time to recover before it was engaged in another conflict, known as the Chaco War (1932-1935). Fought with Bolivia, Paraguay avoided territorial losses but some 30,000 of its men died in battle. WWII and a brief civil war followed before another dictator, Alfredo Stroessner, took power in 1954. Stroessner promised ‘peace and progress,’ but delivered corruption and nepotism; while the military earned fortunes from bootlegging and drug-trafficking, his Colorado Party handed out public sector jobs to friends and family, and tortured political opponents. The Colorado Party continued its autocratic rule until 1993 when it held what is widely regarded as the first democratic election in Paraguayan history. Jaun Carlos Wasmosy Monti, of the Colorado Party, won the presidency which was marred by controversy – he was sentenced to four years in prison for defrauding the Paraguayan state in 2004. His successors fared little better. Then came Roman Catholic bishop, Fernando Lugo, who won the 2008 presidential elections and brought an end to 61 years of Colorado Party rule. Lugo formed the centre-left Patriotic Alliance for Change and put land reforms and corruption at the heart of his manifesto. However, in 2012 Lugo was removed from office in what critics described as a coup d’état. The following year the Colorado Party returned to power and tobacco billionaire, Horacio Cartes, was appointed president. Like many before him, Cartes has pledged to fight corruption and tackle poverty, which afflicts some 30% of the population. Did you know? • Paraguay gained independence from Spain in 1811, but its first democratic elections didn’t come until 1993. • The vaunted Paraguayan novelist poetically described his nation as “an island surrounded on all sides by land.” • Paraguay is one of the few South American countries to have retained its mother tongue (Guarani) as an official language. 89.6% Roman Catholic, 6.2% Protestant. Shaking hands is the usual form of greeting. Smoking is not allowed in cinemas and theatres. Dress tends to be informal and sportswear is popular.Photography: Avoid sensitive subjects such as military installations. The official languages are Spanish and Guaraní; Guaraní is spoken by most of the rural population. Most Paraguayans are bilingual, but prefer to speak Guaraní outside Asunción.","Subtropical with rapid changes in temperature throughout the year. Summer (December to March) can be very hot. Winter (June to September) is mild with few cold days. Rainfall is heaviest from December to March. Lightweight cottons and linens are worn in warmer months, with somewarm clothes for spring and autumn. Mediumweights are best for winter.Rainwear is advisable throughout the year. Paraguay is a landlocked country surrounded by Argentina, Bolivia and Brazil, lying some 1,440km (900 miles) up the River Paraná from the Atlantic. The River Paraguay, a tributary of the Paraná, divides the country into two sharply contrasting regions. The Oriental zone, which covers 159,800 sq km (61,700 sq miles), consists of undulating country intersected by chains of hills rising to about 600m (2,000ft), merging into the Mato Grosso Plateau in the north; the Paraná crosses the area in the east and south. East and southeast of Asunción lie the oldest centres of settlement inhabited by the greater part of the population. This area is bordered to the west by rolling pastures, and to the south by thick primeval forests. The Occidental zone, or Paraguayan Chaco, covers 246,827 sq km (95,300 sq miles). It is a flat alluvial plain, composed mainly of grey clay, which is marked by large areas of permanent swamp in the southern and eastern regions. Apart from a few small settlements, it is sparsely populated."
south-america,peru,"South America doesn’t get much more evocative of generations gone by than Peru. Its mix of ancient civilisations and dramatic archaeology, set among some of the most extraordinary landscapes on the planet, means few destinations have as much to offer cultural visitors. The old Inca settlement of Machu Picchu, now said to be the most visited site on the entire continent, is just the poster-child – it’s utterly magnificent, of course, but it’s just one of many highlights served up by the country. From mountain range to jungle, beach to desert, colonial town to cosmopolitan city, it’s a truly wonderful place to travel. The coastal capital, Lima, can seem chaotic at times, but scratch the surface and you’ll unearth some great museums and nightclubs, not to mention some of the region’s best food and drink – from ceviche (raw fish in citrus) to cecina (dried pork) and from Peruvian wine (yes, really) to pisco sours. But the country’s real appeal lies outside the capital. Contrasting beautifully with Lima is the ancient capital of Cusco with its winding cobbled streets and 1,000-plus years of history. It’s the gateway for visitors to the unmissable Machu Picchu, as well as those walking the Inca trail, but it makes for a colourful destination in its own right. There’s no better place to learn more about the country’s earlier times and the upheaval of the Spanish conquest.  Elsewhere in the country, the Nazca Lines, the beautifully excavated ruins of Chan Chan and the Chachapoya fortress of Kuelap boggle the mind. These extraordinary complexes are all set amid stunning landscapes. But Peru doesn’t solely involve rushing up and down mountains or traipsing around ruins. If you’re searching for a relaxing beach destination, head to Máncora, which is popular with sun-seekers and surfers. A little more subdued, but no less beautiful, is the quaint coastal town of Huanchaco, where you can sit on the beach and watch fishermen ply their trade on traditional reed canoes. It’s a far cry from the lofty Andes and a testament to Peru’s staggering diversity. 1,285,220 sq km (496,226 sq miles). 31,774,225 (UN estimate 2016). 23.7 per sq km. Lima. Republic.

The Spanish imposed its cultural practices on the country, in everything from religion to building construction, and this quickly became very widespread as the country was brought under its control. However, owing to the geography of the country, the smaller, more remote groups of indigenous peoples living in the mountains were largely untouched by Spanish culture. After centuries of colonial rule, Peru declared independence in 1821, and the revolutionary leader Simón Bolívar took over the running of the country. Unfortunately, relations between Peru and its neighbours were not smooth, and over the next 100 years the government had its hands full trying to fight wars while keeping the economy stable. The War of the Pacific (1879-1883) between Chile and Peru all but bankrupted the country, leaving it little chance to recuperate. From 1914 onwards, Peru seemed to lurch from one military coup to another, some more destructive than others. Added to which, throughout the 1980s, it also had to combat the Sendero Luminoso (Shining Path) extremist guerrilla group belonging to the Peruvian Communist Party, resulting in thousands of deaths. Since 1990, Peru has been trying to recover and sustain economic growth, and it is now one of the fastest-growing economies in South America. Despite its booming modernisation, however, tribal life remains in many ways the same today as it was before the Spanish conquest, with indigenous people still dressing in traditional clothes, living in agriculture-based communities and speaking the original languages. Quechua, which was spoken by the Incas, is still widely used in Peru, with an estimated 6 to 8 million speakers. Likewise, the physical characteristics of indigenous peoples remain distinctly Amerindian, whereas in the bigger cities you are more likely to see lighter skin and eyes, and more Western features. Peru has suffered through surges of drug trafficking, which have threatened the recent relative peace of the country. Some estimate that Peruvian cocaine exports have overtaken those of Colombia. Did you know? •	Abimael Guzmán, leader of the Sendero Luminoso movement, was finally captured in a hideaway above a ballet school in a plush Lima neighbourhood. •	The Yavarí is a floating hotel on Lake Titicaca, built as an iron steamboat in England in 1861 and transported from the coast of Peru in pieces by mules. •	The Callao, Lima & Oroya Railway is the second-highest railway line in the world, reaching 4,783m (15,692ft) in the Andes, after a journey from sea level at Lima. 81.3% Roman Catholic, 12.5% Evangelical, 3.3% other denominations, 2.9% unspecified or none. Shaking hands is the customary form of greeting. Kissing on one cheek between women and between women and men is common in coastal cities. Travellers should avoid the scruffy ‘backpacker’ look – it is not admired and considered bad etiquette. Peruvians (and Latin Americans in general) are not really confrontational people – if you are struggling with some aspect of your travel (uncomfortable rooms, late buses etc), losing your temper will not get you very far. Instead, stay patient, keep smiling and someone will help you eventually, if only to make you go away. Spanish and Quechua are the official languages. Aymara is spoken in the Lake Titicaca area. Many other dialects exist in the jungle regions. English is spoken in major tourist areas.

Likewise, the coast covers such a large stretch of longitude that the temperature changes dramatically as you head further south. On the coast winter lasts from June to September. The weather tends to be overcast and slightly damp at this time, but rarely very cold. It hardly ever rains in Lima nor most of the coast, except for Tumbes and Piura, which have tropical climates. During June to September, the mountainous areas are often sunny during the day but cold at night. This is high tourist season and the best time to visit most regions. Rainy season in the Andes starts in September and peaks between January and March, and this is a dreadful and occasionally dangerous time to be hiking. Heavy rains in the mountains and jungle last from December to April. It is rainy and hot for most of the year, but between March and September there are occasional cold surges which might require a jumper. For travel in Peru, a variety of clothes are necessary. You will need very lightweight clothes for summer on the coast, and thermals, hats, gloves and ski jackets for winter up in the mountains. It can become freezing at night at altitude and remain hot and sticky through the nights in the jungle. Waterproof clothing is thoroughly recommended for the rainy season, because the heavens open very suddenly, and then it pours. If you are travelling to the jungle you’ll need something protective and waterproof for your feet. For any mountain hiking you’ll need proper, supportive boots. If you’re spending time along the coast you’ll need sandals or flip-flops. Peru is a large, mountainous country on the Pacific coast of South America that borders Ecuador and Colombia to the north, Brazil and Bolivia to the east, and Chile to the south. The Pacific Ocean lies to the west. There are three natural zones: The Costa region, which contains Lima (the capital), is a narrow coastal plain consisting of large tracts of desert broken by fertile valleys. The cotton, sugar and rice plantations and most of the so-far exploited oil fields lie in this area, as does the majority of the population. The best roads run along the coast, having straight, flat paths ahead of them, and travel times are usually good. The highland Sierra contains the Andes, with peaks over 6,000m (20,000ft), most of the country's mineral resources (silver, zinc, lead, copper and gold) and the greater part of its livestock. Roads in this area wind up, down and around mountains, so travelling in this area is often time-consuming. The Selva (jungle), an area of fertile, subtropical land, lies between the Andes and the borders with Brazil, Bolivia, Colombia and Ecuador. The Amazonian jungle has vast natural resources. The absence of land communications, however, left the area largely uncharted until full-scale oil exploration began in 1973. Even today roads barely penetrate the region. Some areas are best reached by small plane."
south-america,surinam,"The smallest of the Guyanas (the collective term for Guyana, French Guyana and Surinam), this diminutive destination may only have half a million odd inhabitants, but it’s the liveliest of these onetime colonial backwaters. It’s also often overlooked by travellers, which is their loss because Surinam has much to offer. The country is culturally fascinating. Languages spoken include Dutch, Creole, Chinese and English, which reflects the vibrant ethnic mix of its people. It’s also extraordinarily beautiful: the capital city is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and its tropical forests are full of wildlife, with an impressive one third of the country protected in nature reserves. The 17th-century UNESCO capital, Paramaribo, is a good starting point for any trip. Home to a sumptuous collection of wooden colonial buildings, which line the waterfront, the city also lays claim to Central Market, a high-energy bazaar selling everything from quack medicine to fresh fish. At night you can dine on fresh seafood in local restaurants and cut shapes in lively bars, which are far removed from the tranquillity of the rest of the country. Surinam's main attraction is its tropical rainforest, which covers nearly 80% of the country and harbours a huge variety of wildlife. Ecotourism is well developed here and some of the best lodges in South America can be found in the country’s jungle. With its intricate lattice of rivers, boat is the best way to get around the rainforest and you can take tours to see nesting leatherback turtles or search for other exotic creatures, including Amazon river dolphins, monkeys and, if you’re really lucky, a jaguar. The country’s diverse cultural roots have also been well preserved: communities of Amerindians and Maroons – descendants of former African slaves – lie deep in the jungle, offering visitors an insight into their lifestyle, harmoniously adapted to their environment. Back in the cities, the busy festival calendar covers an eclectic range of events including jazz jamborees, Easter Carnival and exuberant Christmas parties, which climax on New Year’s Eve with the legendary Surifesta. It’s a wild and wonderful celebration. It’s Surinam in a microcosm. 163,265 sq km (63,037 sq miles). 547,610 (UN estimate 2016). 3.6 per sq km. Paramaribo. Republic.

Fierce resistance to colonisation deterred most would-be occupiers from Europe, although the territory changed hands many times between the Dutch, British and French before being confirmed as a Dutch possession by the 1815 Treaty of Vienna. At this time, the majority of the population were slaves working on plantations and despite the abolition of slavery in 1863, conditions altered very little until the early 20th century and the discovery of large bauxite deposits, which brought about a major change in the economic and political complexion of the country. In 1954, Suriname and the Netherlands Antilles became autonomous regions within the Kingdom of the Netherlands. When full independence was achieved in 1975 the new country's political parties were organised largely along ethnic lines – descendants of the black slave workforce, Indonesians, Indians, mixed-race Creoles and a small European contingent. The ensuing coalition governments tended to destabilise the political process and in February 1980, the coalition that had taken power in 1975 was overthrown by a popular military coup. The new regime, under Lt-Col Desi Bouterse, cultivated close links with Cuba at the expense of those with the Netherlands. Then came a civil war, which broke out between the regime and jungle-based dissidents. The economic burden of the war prompted the military regime to return to civilian rule and a democratic constitution was agreed in March 1987 (a ceasefire with the guerrillas was finally reached in 1992). After a dispute with elected President Ransewak Shankar in 1990, Desi Bouterse dismissed the government (by telephone!) and put the military back in charge before further elections in 1991. As his power waned in the 1990s Bouterse was convicted in absentia on drug smuggling charges in the Netherlands and sentenced to 11 years in prison. Unsurprisingly the Dutch government said it would only maintain necessary contact with Desi Bouterse when he was elected as Suriname’s president in July 2010, a position he continues to hold. Did you know? •	Although the official spelling of the country’s English name was changed to ‘Suriname’ in 1978, ‘Surinam’ is still found, notably by the national airline. •	Suriname is the only Dutch speaking country in South America. •	Suriname and neighbouring Guyana are South America’s only countries that drive on the left.

The best time to visit is February to April (short dry season) and August to October (long dry season). The rainy seasons last from November to January and from May to July. Surinam lies outside the hurricane zone and the most extreme weather condition is the sibibusi (forest broom), a heavy rain shower. Lightweights and rainwear. Surinam is bordered to the north by the Atlantic Ocean, to the east by the Marowijne River (which forms the border with French Guiana), to the west by the Corantijn River (which forms the border with Guyana), and to the south by forests, savannahs and mountains, which separate it from Brazil. In the northern part of the country are coastal lowlands covered with mangrove swamps. Further inland runs a narrow strip of savannah land. To the south, the land becomes hilly and then mountainous, covered with dense tropical forest, and cut by numerous rivers and streams."
south-america,uruguay,"A peaceful, laidback destination with a long history of liberalism (Uruguay was the first country to fully legalize marijuana) this pint-sized nation finds itself squeezed between Brazil and Argentina, and is often overshadowed by its heavyweight neighbours. However, as Uruguay has come to appreciate its subtle charms and small-scale attractions, so too have travellers. Veer off the Gringo Trail and into Uruguay, and you will be pleasantly surprised. Considering its size, the country boasts an astonishing variety of diversions. Its windswept Atlantic coastline features dunes, lagoons and perfect surf; visitors can hop between hip beach resorts, clustered around the chic Punta del Este, abscond to sleepy fishing villages or take wildlife excursions to see penguins, sea lions and whales. The interior is equally rewarding. Journey up the Rio de la Plata and discover charming colonial towns, thermal springs and working haciendas, which offer an authentic taste of traditional gaucho life. The jewel in Uruguay’s crown, though, is the capital, Montevideo. Punching well above its weight culturally and economically, this buzzing metropolis is classified as a Beta World City and is considered the most gay-friendly city in Latin America. Montevideo is a handsome place of stunning architecture, breezy promenades and sandy beaches. It’s also home to the world’s longest carnival, a heady six-week street party that puts other South American cities to shame. Sleepy Colonia del Sacramento is another gem. Situated on the banks of the Rio de la Plata, opposite Buenos Aires, this amorous city offers enchanting cobbled streets, leafy plazas and 18th-century Portuguese architecture. It’s unflappably laidback, but for something even cooler head to Cabo Polonio, an off-grid eco-resort founded by hippies and fishermen, where the stresses of modern life ebb away and there’s time to appreciate nature and likeminded people. All things considered, Uruguay should be treated like one of its famous beefsteaks; take your time over it, savour it and when you’re done, come back for more.

President Luis Lacalle Pou since 2020.","Originally settled by the tribal Charrúa people, Uruguay's territory was hotly contested from the arrival of the first Europeans, due to its strategic position near the mouth of the Río de la Plata. The Spanish established the capital Montevideo in 1726 but continued to battle with the Portuguese for control of the region. In 1828, a scrappy band of patriots led by General Juan Lavalleja and inspired by nationalist hero José Artigas finally won independence for Uruguay, establishing it as a buffer between the newly formed nations of Brazil and Argentina. Regional strife continued for several decades, as Uruguay's two major political parties emerged. The liberally inclined Colorado Party, associated with Montevideo's business owners, and the right-wing National Party, representing rural interests, came to be known as Colorados ('Reds') and Blancos ('Whites') – terms that survive to this day. The Great War of 1843-52 and the War of the Triple Alliance (Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay against Paraguay, 1864-1870) pitted the two parties against one another, prompting continued interventions by Argentina and Brazil. The Blancos and Colorados finally reached a stable power-sharing agreement in 1872. In the late 19th century, an influx of European immigrants helped transform Uruguay into an agricultural powerhouse. Under the progressive Colorado administrations of José Batlle y Ordonez between 1903 and 1915, Uruguay established Latin America's first welfare state, gave women the vote and abolished both the death penalty and the link between church and state. As the 20th century progressed, Uruguay's economic fortunes deteriorated and in the 1970s the country slid into a dictatorship under Juan Maria Bordaberry Arocena. Civilian rule resumed in 1985, accompanied by the ascendancy of the Frente Amplio, a leftist coalition that became Uruguay's first successful third party under President José Mujica. Before taking the presidency, Mujica had spent 14 years in prison for opposing the previous dictatorship. Whilst in power he donated 90% of his salary to charity, legalised marijuana and continued to pick up hitchhikers in his old VW Beetle, making him something of a hero around the world. He was succeeded by Tabaré Vázquez in 2015. Did you know? •	In 1930, Uruguay hosted the first FIFA World Cup, beating their arch-rivals, Argentina, 4-2 in the final. •	The Tupamaros were Marxist urban guerrillas, who wrought havoc in the late 1960s. Their leader and future president Jose Mujica was imprisoned at the bottom of a well. •	Fray Bentos, a town in western Uruguay, was the original home of corned beef, and is now a listed UNESCO World Heritage Site.

Uruguayans are very hospitable and like to entertain both at home and in restaurants. Normal courtesies should be observed. Smoking is not allowed in public spaces, including restaurants, cinemas, theatres and public transport. The official language is Spanish. Along the northern border with Brazil, many residents also speak a hybrid of Spanish and Portuguese known as Portuñol. English is widely spoken in tourist resorts.","Uruguay has an exceptionally fine temperate climate, with mild summers and winters. Summer is from December to March and is the most pleasant time, especially along the coast. Beach resorts get crowded between Christmas and February, with peak crowds during the month of January. In the interior and along the Río Uruguay, January is the hottest month, with temperatures sometimes climbing uncomfortably above 30˚C (86°F). For fine weather and quieter conditions countrywide, December and March are good months to visit. Winter and spring can get chilly due to wind and rain, but temperatures remain dependably above freezing. Bring lightweight clothing in summer; mediumweight clothing for winter, autumn and spring. A raincoat is advisable year-round. Uruguay is bordered to the north by Brazil, to the southeast by the Atlantic, and is separated from Argentina in the west and south by the River Uruguay, which widens out into the Rio de la Plata estuary. The landscape is made up of hilly meadows broken by streams and rivers. There are a string of beaches along the coast. Most of the country is grazing land for sheep and cattle. Montevideo, the most southern point of the nation, accommodates nearly half of the population. About 90% of the land is suitable for agriculture, although only 12% is used in this way."
south-america,venezuela,"With its reputation for violence and political instability, many travellers opt to give Venezuela a wide berth. But those brave enough to visit this feisty South American nation will discover a country of extraordinary diversity and abundant natural beauty; a land of lofty Andean peaks, mysterious Lost World plateaus, wildlife rich rainforests, vibrant cities and idyllic Caribbean islands. At the heart of all this lies Caracas, Venezuela’s thronging capital. A hotchpotch of hillside favelas, crumbling colonial buildings and glistening skyscrapers, the city has much to offer visitors; there’s a fine collection of museums, galleries and historic monuments, not to mention a pulsating nightlife. Even the food’s good, nowadays. But for all its appeal, most of Venezuela’s attractions lie beyond the capital city, hidden away in national parks and reserves which cover an impressive 40% of the country. The lush tropical lowlands of Los Llanos harbour abundant wildlife, with eco-conscious hatos (ranches) offering safaris to view caiman, puma, anaconda, capybara, hundreds of birds and much more. Then there are the table-top mountains of the Guyana Highlands, whose summits loom over golden savannahs and bristle with prehistoric flora and fauna. These towering peaks spawn dramatic waterfalls, including the awesome Angel Falls, officially the world’s highest. Those with an appetite for adventure can be sated with an excursion into the virgin rainforest of Amazonas, Venezuela’s least-visited region, where indigenous communities cling onto traditional lives in the jungle. Alternatively, head to Mérida to tackle the soaring Andean peaks or go piranha fishing in the Orinoco, South America’s second longest river, which empties into the wildlife-rich wetlands of the Orinoco Delta. Beyond that, the clear waters of the Caribbean lap onto Venezuela’s stunning coastline, where numerous offshore islands provide ample opportunities for reef diving, partying and pandering to pleasure. Amongst them the Los Roques archipelago, which is the epitome of Caribbean island idyll and a very long way from the unsavoury headlines of the mainland. 912,050 sq km (352,144 sq miles). 31,518,855 (UN estimate 2016). 32.1 per sq km.

Spanish rule was administered from a distance, leaving the various regions to develop separately from the capital, Caracas. In the 18th century, an attempt to inject a measure of unification was met with widespread resistance led by Simón Bolívar, who remains a national hero. Bolívar’s dream of creating a mega-territory, Gran Colombia, composed of Venezuela, Colombia and Ecuador, collapsed through in-fighting. Instead, in 1830, Venezuela became a sovereign state, led by José Paéz. The precise territorial limits were not, however, well defined, and Venezuela's borders have since been subject to periodic disputes. The exploitation of the country's substantial oilfields began in 1918 with an oil boom similar to the cocoa and coffee booms of the 17th and 19th centuries. In each case, the wealth was largely export driven, making a small elite spectacularly rich but failing to develop the country’s wider economy, leaving the majority poor and exploited. Widespread political corruption was the norm and despotic military leaders ran the country throughout most of the first half of the 20th century, until democracy was introduced in 1958. In the 1980s, successive governments struggled to stabilise the country in the face of persistent social unrest and in 1992, a number of army units launched an unexpected military coup that was suppressed by loyal army units but introduced the world to its charismatic figurehead, Colonel Hugo Chávez. Five years later he formed his own party then fought and won the 1998 election. Further polls in 2000 secured his position and, de facto, an endorsement of the constitutional changes that he planned, which increased presidential powers. Land reforms and a nationalisation programme boosted the government’s popular appeal, but sparked strong opposition from both the ruling classes and international business interests that typified the Chavez era until his death from cancer in 2013. His successor, Nicolas Maduro’s term in office has been characterised by protests and the suppression of his political opponents as Venezuela has lapsed into an economic, political and social crisis. Food and medical shortages have become commonplace and basic goods are rationed. Violent crime has also reached an all-time high with a record 28,479 people killed in 2016, according to the independent group the Venezuelan Violence Observatory. Did you know? •	Venezuela is one of 17 mega-diverse countries, habitats range from river deltas, Caribbean coast and extensive plains to rainforest, cloud forest and the Andes mountains. •	Venezuela has the world’s largest oil reserves and is a founding member of OPEC. •	Venezuela first formed a professional baseball league in 1945 and today baseball is the nation’s most popular sport.. Venezuela is majority Roman Catholic (77%), with small but influential Protestant, Jewish, Muslim and Buddhist communities. Venezuelans are known for being warm and friendly, with people often greeting each other with a kiss, or using the local abrazo (a cross between a hug and a handshake). Handshakes are reserved for greeting strangers. Personal space is much less of a concern, so don’t be alarmed if people stand very close when holding a conversation. In Caracas, conservative casual wear is the norm. Men are expected to wear suits for business, and jackets and ties are usual for dining out and social functions. Dress on the coast is less formal but beachwear and shorts should not be worn away from the beach or pool. In 2011 Venezuela introduced a ban on smoking in all enclosed public and commercial spaces, including malls, restaurants, bars, discos and workplaces. Spanish is the official language. English, French, German and Portuguese are also spoken by some sections of the community.","Venezuela's location perched 8° above the equator, means it generally enjoys a balmy warm climate. Temperatures don't fluctuate wildly, hovering between 26°C (79°F) and 28°C (82°F) and making the country something of an all year round destination. The coastal regions on the Caribbean feel balmiest, and the lowland areas also enjoy a tropical climate. The main factor in temperature variance is altitude. The mountainous Andean regions are significantly cooler, and temperatures can drop to around 9°C (48°F). Venezuela's rainy season runs from May to December. During this period, there is the possibility of flooding in certain low-lying areas, such as the Llanos and in some valleys of the Andes. The dry season is from December to April, with January and February being the coolest months, and July and August being the warmest. The best time to visit the Andes mountains is from October to May, before the rains come in June. Venezuela's weather is quite changeable, and even during the dry season there's always a chance of rain. If you're up in the northern mountainous region, you're likely to encounter a good few downpours. Lightweight cottons and jeans will be suitable in most locations, whether in the lowlands or on the coast. Pack a sweater or jacket if you're planning to spend any time in the Andes. It's also a good idea to take some waterproofs or a sturdy umbrella whichever region you're visiting. Situated in the north east corner of the South American continent, Venezuela is bordered to the north by the Caribbean, to the east by Guyana and the Atlantic Ocean, to the south by Brazil, and to the west and southwest by Colombia. The country consists of four distinctive regions: the Venezuelan Highlands in the west; the Maracaibo Lowlands in the northwest; the vast central plain of Los Llanos around the Orinoco River; and the Guyana region in the extreme south, which includes part of the Amazon rainforest and the Guyana highlands. Various parts of Venezuela, including Caracas and the eastern part of Sucre, are vulnerable to earthquakes, although there have been no serious ones for many years. Important topographical features include the Orinoco river, the largest river in South America after the Amazon, at a length of 2,140km (1,330 miles), and the dramatic table top mountains known as tepuis, which are found in the Guyana highlands. Angel Falls, situated in the Canaima National Park is the highest waterfall in the world, plunging into the Orinoco from a height of 979m (3,212ft). The Andes mountain range crosses the northwestern region of the country, with the highest peak Pico Bolivar reaching heights of 5,007m (16,427ft)."
